PERTAINING TO ITS

SYSTEMWIDE SENIOR LIEN PARKING REVENUE BONDS, SERIES 2011
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this Official Statement, which includes the cover page and the Appendices hereto,
is to furnish information in connection with the issuance by the Metropolitan Boston Transit Parking
Corporation (the “Issuer” or the “Corporation”), a Massachusetts nonprofit corporation and agency and
instrumentality of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (the “MBTA”) of the Issuer’s
Systemwide Senior Lien Parking Revenue Bonds, Series 2011 (the “Bonds”). Unless otherwise defined
herein, certain capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth in APPENDIX B –
“SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE GENERAL RESOLUTION.”
The Bonds are to be issued under the Systemwide Parking Revenue Bond Resolution adopted by
the Issuer on May 27, 2011 (the “General Resolution”), as supplemented by the First Supplemental
Resolution Authorizing the Issuance of the Bonds adopted by the Issuer on May 27, 2011 (the
“Supplemental Resolution” and, together with the General Resolution, the “Resolution”). U.S. Bank,
National Association (the “Trustee”) will serve as Trustee and Paying Agent for the Bonds.
The MBTA is the oldest and fifth largest public transit system in the country, operating subway,
trackless trolley, trolley, bus, commuter boat and commuter rail services throughout eastern
Massachusetts. The MBTA’s territory consists of 175 cities and towns covering 3,244 square miles and a
population of approximately 4.7 million (2000 census). The MBTA is responsible for an estimated 1.24
million passenger trips every business day and operates over 1,250 route miles.
The Issuer was established by the MBTA solely for the purpose of issuing bonds on behalf of the
MBTA secured by the gross revenues generated by the MBTA’s parking facilities. The establishment of
the Issuer and the issuance of the Bonds were approved by the MBTA on May 4, 2011. The Bonds will
constitute special obligations of the Issuer payable solely from and secured by a pledge of Revenues and
funds and accounts established under the General Resolution.
Revenues consist primarily of gross revenues derived from the MBTA’s parking facilities (the
“Parking System” or the “Parking Facilities”) identified in the Systemwide Parking Revenue Transfer and
Disposition Agreement dated as of June 1, 2011 (The “Transfer and Disposition Agreement”). As of May
15, 2011, the Parking System consists of 95 surface lots and enclosed parking garages throughout the
greater Boston area with approximately 44,000 spaces, which serve all modes of the MBTA’s transit
system. See “PARKING SYSTEM.” The Transfer and Disposition Agreement provides for the transfer of
all gross revenues generated from the Parking System to the Corporation and other rights and obligations
of the Corporation and the MBTA with respect to the Bonds. The MBTA will continue to own and
operate the Parking Facilities and be solely responsible for rate setting and for all operating and
maintenance expense, including capital expenditures, related thereto. See “SYSTEMWIDE PARKING
REVENUE TRANSFER AND DISPOSITION AGREEMENT” and APPENDIX C.

The Bonds are being issued for the purpose of (i) making a payment to the MBTA to refund a
portion of the MBTA’s outstanding indebtedness; (ii) funding the Debt Service Reserve Fund for the
Bonds and (iii) paying the costs of issuing the Bonds. See “APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS.”
The Issuer and the MBTA have no taxing power. None of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
(the “Commonwealth”), the MBTA or any political subdivision of the Commonwealth shall be obligated
to pay the Bonds and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the Commonwealth or any
political subdivision thereof is pledged to such payment. See “SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT
FOR THE BONDS.”
There follows in this Official Statement a description of the Corporation, the MBTA and the
Parking System, together with summaries of the terms of the Bonds and certain provisions of the General
Resolution and the Transfer and Disposition Agreement. All references herein to the General Resolution
are qualified in their entirety by reference to such document, copies of which are available from the
MBTA or the Trustee, and all references to the Bonds are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
definitive forms thereof and the information with respect thereto contained in the Resolution.

of DTC and disbursement of such payments to Beneficial Owners (hereinafter defined) is the responsibility
of the DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants (hereinafter defined). See APPENDIX F – “BOOKENTRY ONLY SYSTEM.”

any date on or after July 1, 2021 at the option of the Issuer and in such order of maturity as may be

maturities (or sinking fund installments within a term bond) of Bonds to be redeemed at the option of the
Issuer will be determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion.
If less than all the Bonds of a particular maturity (or sinking fund installment within a term bond)
are called for prior redemption, the particular Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed shall be selected by
lot, and, if registered in the book-entry only system, in accordance with DTC procedures.
Notice of Redemption; Effect of Redemption
In the event any of the Bonds are called for redemption, the Trustee shall give notice, in the name
of the Issuer, of the redemption of such Bonds, which notice shall (i) specify the Bonds to be redeemed,
the redemption date, the redemption price, and the place or places where amounts due upon such
redemption will be payable (which shall be the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee) and, if less
than all of the Bonds are to be redeemed, the numbers of the Bonds, and the portions of the Bonds, so to
be redeemed, (ii) state any condition to such redemption, and (iii) state that on the redemption date, and
upon the satisfaction of any such condition, the Bonds to be redeemed shall cease to bear interest.
CUSIP number identification shall accompany all redemption notices. Such notice may set forth any
additional information relating to such redemption.

3

Such notice shall be given by mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days
prior to the date fixed for redemption to each Holder of Bonds to be redeemed at its address shown on the
registration books kept by the Trustee; provided, however, that failure to give such notice to any
Bondholder or any defect in such notice shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption
of any of the other Bonds. The Trustee shall send a second notice of redemption by certified mail return
receipt requested to any registered Holder who has not submitted Bonds called for redemption 30 days
after the redemption date, provided, however, that the failure to give any second notice by mailing, or any
defect in such notice, shall not affect the validity of any proceedings for the redemption of any of the
Bonds and the Trustee shall not be liable for any failure by the Trustee to send any second notice.
Any Bonds and portions of Bonds that have been duly selected for redemption and that are paid
in accordance with the Bond Resolution shall cease to bear interest on the specified redemption date.
Transfer and Exchange
In the event that the Book-Entry Only System is discontinued, the following provisions would
apply: Bonds of a series may be exchanged for an equal aggregate principal amount of Bonds in other
authorized denominations and of the same maturity, upon surrender thereof at the principal corporate trust
office of the Trustee. The transfer of any Bond may be registered on the books maintained by the Trustee
for such purpose only upon the surrender thereof by the registered owner or by such owner’s attorney duly
authorized in writing to the Trustee with a duly executed assignment in form satisfactory to the Trustee. For
every exchange or registration of transfer of Bonds, the Corporation and the Trustee may make a charge to
the owner an amount sufficient to reimburse them for any tax, fee or other governmental charge required to
be paid with respect to such exchange or registration of transfer, and, except for (i) with respect to the
delivery of definitive Bonds in exchange for temporary bonds; (ii) in the case of a bond issued upon the first
exchange or transfer of a Bond surrendered for such purpose within sixty (60) days after the first
authentication and delivery of the Bonds; or (iii) as otherwise provided in the Bond Resolution, the Trustee
may charge a sum sufficient to pay the cost of preparing each new Bond issued upon such exchange or
transfer, which sum or sums shall be paid by the person requesting such exchange or transfer as a condition
precedent to the exercise of the privilege of making such exchange or transfer.
Neither the Corporation nor the Trustee shall be required (i) to register, transfer or exchange Bonds
for a period of fifteen (15) days next preceding an interest payment on the Bonds or next preceding any
selection of Bonds to be redeemed or thereafter until the mailing of any notice of redemption; or (ii) to
register, transfer or exchange any Bonds called for redemption.

in respect of the Parking Facilities or pursuant to the Transfer and Disposition Agreement or (b) derived
from any other source, to the extent such moneys are deposited or required to be deposited to the Revenue
Fund by the Corporation in accordance with the Resolution and (ii) all accounts, general intangibles and
contract or other rights to receive Revenues described in clause (i), whether existing at the effective date of
the Resolution or thereafter coming into existence and whether held by the Corporation at the effective date
of the Resolution or thereafter acquired, and the proceeds thereof, including, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the earnings on the investment of any moneys held under the Resolution by the Trustee, a
Depository or the Corporation or remitted to the Corporation by the Trustee, revenues assigned by the
MBTA and payments due from or on behalf of the MBTA to the Corporation pursuant to the Transfer and
Disposition Agreement, proceeds from any grant or appropriation for or on account of Issuer Administrative
Expenses received by the Corporation from the United States or the Commonwealth or from any agency,
instrumentality or political subdivision of either thereof, including without limitation the MBTA. Revenues
shall exclude Dedicated Payments. See APPENDIX B – “SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE
GENERAL RESOLUTION - DEDICATED PAYMENTS.”
Flow of Funds
The Resolution establishes the following funds and accounts to be held and administered by the
Trustee:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)

the Revenue Fund;
the Debt Service Fund;
the Redemption Fund;
the Debt Service Reserve Fund; and
the Rebate Fund.

6

Pursuant to the Resolution, all Revenues, except for certain earnings on investment of the funds
and accounts under the Resolution to the extent provided in the Resolution, shall be collected by or for the
account of the Corporation in accordance with the Transfer and Disposition Agreement and deposited by
or on behalf of the Corporation as promptly as practicable in the Revenue Fund. See “PARKING SYSTEM
– RATE AND CHARGES” for information about the collection of such Revenues.
On or before the 25th day of each calendar month, beginning in July, 2011, the Trustee shall apply
amounts available in the Revenue Fund as follows and in the following order:
(i)

To the Debt Service Fund, an amount which, when added to other amounts on
deposit in such Fund and available for such purpose, including amounts in the
Capitalized Interest Account, if any, so that the balance in said Fund shall equal
the Debt Service Requirement accrued or accruing up to and including the last
day of such month; and

(ii)

To the Debt Service Reserve Fund, an amount which, together with amounts on
deposit therein, will equal the Debt Service Reserve Fund Requirement as of the
first day of the next ensuing month.

Any balance remaining in the Revenue Fund following the above payments shall be used to pay
Issuer Administrative Expenses, if any, or retained in the Revenue Fund to be available for payments
therefrom in the succeeding months, with the balance of such Revenues transferred to the MBTA.
Covenant as to Revenues
Under the Resolution, so long as any Bonds are Outstanding, the Issuer shall cause the MBTA to
establish and maintain parking rates and charges at the Parking Facilities at levels adequate at all times, with
other available funds, to provide Revenues and other moneys at least sufficient to pay or provide for, as the
same become due or payable, (i) all payments of Principal Installments and Redemption Price of and interest
on the Bonds, (ii) all amounts payable to the Debt Service Reserve Fund, (iii) Issuer Administrative
Expenses and (iv) all other amounts which the Issuer may by law or contract be obligated to pay from
Revenues.
In addition, the Issuer is required to cause the MBTA to establish and maintain parking rates and
charges at the Parking Facilities at levels sufficient so that total Revenues, as of the end of each Fiscal Year
during which Bonds are Outstanding, shall equal at least 125% of Maximum Annual Debt Service with
respect to all Bonds Outstanding as of such dates; provided that such portion of Revenues derived from the
Parking Facilities and any earnings allocable thereto shall equal at least 110% of the Maximum Annual Debt
Service with respect to all Bonds Outstanding as of such date (such requirements are collectively referred to
as the “Rate Covenant”).
The MBTA has agreed to establish and maintain parking rates and charges at the Parking Facilities
at levels adequate at all times, with other Funds available to the Issuer, to satisfy the Rate Covenant. See
“SYSTEMWIDE PARKING REVENUE TRANSFER AND DISPOSITION AGREEMENT” and APPENDIX C.
On or before the last Business Day of each Fiscal Year the Issuer shall review the adequacy of the
MBTA’s rates and charges at the Parking Facilities to satisfy the requirements of the Rate Covenant for
the next succeeding Fiscal Year. If such review indicates that the Revenues are, or are likely to be,
insufficient to meet the Rate Covenant for the next succeeding Fiscal Year, or if it otherwise appears at
any time during such Fiscal Year that Revenues are or are likely to be insufficient to meet such Rate
Covenant, the Issuer shall promptly notify the MBTA and cause the MBTA to promptly engage the
services of a Parking Consultant. The Parking Consultant shall be instructed to review and analyze the
7

operations of the Parking Facilities and submit to the Issuer, the MBTA and the Trustee, within 60 days
after such engagement, a written report containing the Parking Consultant’s recommendation of actions
designed to result in compliance with the Rate Covenant at the earliest practicable time. Within 60 days
of receiving such report, the Issuer shall take the actions or cause the MBTA to take the actions
recommended in the report, provided that the Issuer or MBTA may take such other actions as may be
agreed upon by the Issuer and the MBTA if the Parking Consultant certifies in writing that such other
actions are in its opinion likely to result in compliance with the requirements of the Rate Covenant by a
date no later than the date projected in its report in connection with its own recommendations. So long as
the Issuer and the MBTA are following the recommendations of the Parking Consultant and total
Revenues for the preceding Fiscal Year were equal to at least 110% of the Maximum Annual Debt
Service with respect to all Bonds Outstanding as of such date, failure to comply with the Rate Covenant
shall not be an Event of Default under the Resolution. See APPENDIX B.
Debt Service Reserve Fund
The Resolution establishes a Debt Service Reserve Fund to be funded in the amount of the Debt
Service Reserve Fund Requirement and held by the Trustee to secure the Bonds. The Debt Service
Reserve Fund Requirement is equal to one-half of the Maximum Annual Debt Service on all Bonds
Outstanding under the Resolution, provided that in no event shall such amount exceed the least of (i) 10%
of the original net proceeds of the Bonds, (ii) Maximum Annual Debt Service on the Bonds and (iii)
125% of average annual debt service on the Bonds. The Debt Service Reserve Fund Requirement for
Subordinated Bonds, if any, shall be as set forth in the applicable Supplemental Resolution authorizing
such Series of Subordinated Bonds.
Additional Bonds
Under the Resolution, the Corporation may issue Additional Bonds or Subordinated Bonds to pay
amounts owed by the Corporation to the MBTA in satisfaction of the obligations under the Transfer and
Disposition Agreement or to fund any other lawful purpose of the Corporation or the MBTA or to refund
the Bonds or Additional Bonds or Subordinated Bonds of the Corporation. Additional Bonds may be
issued if Revenues derived from Parking Facilities and any earnings allocable thereto for twelve (12)
successive months in the last eighteen (18) immediately preceding the issuance of such Bonds were equal
to at least 150% of the Maximum Annual Debt Service on all Outstanding Bonds, assuming the issuance
of the Bonds.
For purposes of the additional bonds test described in the preceding paragraph, Revenues for
Fiscal Year 2010 were equal to 153% of the Maximum Annual Debt Service on the Bonds ($24,588,800).
In addition, Additional Bonds may be issued to refund Outstanding Bonds, if the Debt Service
Requirement in each Fiscal Year in which Bonds will be Outstanding following the refunding will not be
greater than the Debt Service Requirement in the Fiscal Years in which the Bonds were Outstanding prior
to the refunding or the present value of the Debt Service Requirement shall have been reduced as a result
of the refunding.
The Resolution also provides for the issuance of bonds or other debt obligations secured by a
pledge of Trust Assets that is subordinate to the pledge of the Bonds. See APPENDIX B – “SUMMARY OF
CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE GENERAL RESOLUTION – SUBORDINATED BONDS.”
Other than Additional Bonds and Subordinated Bonds, the Corporation may not issue any bonds,
notes or other evidences of indebtedness secured by a pledge of or lien on Revenues or other Trust Assets.

Enforcement of Transfer and Disposition Agreement
Under the Resolution, the Corporation agrees to keep in full force and effect the Transfer and
Disposition Agreement and to promptly and diligently enforce the Corporation’s rights thereunder. The
Corporation also agrees not to voluntarily consent to or permit any rescission of or consent to any
amendment to or otherwise take any action under or in connection with the Transfer and Disposition
Agreement which will have a material adverse effect upon the rights of the Holders from time to time of the
Bonds.
SYSTEMWIDE PARKING REVENUE TRANSFER AND DISPOSITION AGREEMENT
The Corporation and the MBTA are executing the Transfer and Disposition Agreement to provide
for the transfer of all gross revenues generated from the Parking System to the Corporation and other
rights and obligations of the Corporation and the MBTA with respect to the Bonds. The form of the
Systemwide Parking Revenue Transfer and Disposition Agreement is included in APPENDIX C.
In particular, under the Transfer and Disposition Agreement, the MBTA agrees to establish and
maintain parking rates and charges at the Parking Facilities at levels adequate at all times, with other
funds available to the Corporation, to provide Revenues and other moneys to meet the Rate Covenant.
The MBTA also agrees to operate the Parking Facilities, or cause such facilities to be operated
pursuant to management agreements, properly and in a sound, efficient and economical manner and shall
maintain, preserve, and keep the same or cause the same to be maintained, preserved, and kept in
functional working order and condition, and shall from time to time make, or cause to be made, all
necessary and proper repairs, replacements and renewals so that the operation of the Parking Facilities
may be properly conducted. Under the Transfer and Disposition Agreement, the Authority remains
responsible for all operating expenses and capital and maintenance costs related to the Parking Facilities.
The Transfer and Disposition Agreement also provides for the deposit with the Trustee of all
Revenues received by or on account of the MBTA with respect to the Parking Facilities.
The MBTA also agrees not to expand any existing parking facility or construct a new parking
facility, either of which is not then a Parking Facility, that services the same service area of the MBTA as
the Parking Facilities if such expansion or construction would adversely affect the ability of the
Corporation to satisfy the Rate Covenant. The Transfer and Disposition Agreement also provide that the
MBTA will not dispose of all or a portion of the Parking Facilities unless it can demonstrate, in a
certificate of an Authorized Officer, that Revenues from the Parking Facilities during twelve (12)
successive months of the last twenty-four (24) months immediately preceding the date of the proposed
disposition, excluding Revenues generated from such portion of the Parking Facilities to be disposed of,
were at least equal to 150% of Maximum Annual Debt Service on all Outstanding Bonds.
The Transfer and Disposition Agreement provides that the MBTA may, at any time, add
additional parking facilities to the Parking Facilities.
See APPENDIX C for a form of the Systemwide Parking Revenue Transfer and Disposition
Agreement.
CORPORATION
The Corporation is a Massachusetts nonprofit corporation organized under the provisions of
Chapter 180 of Massachusetts General Laws, the law governing nonprofit corporations. The Corporation

9

was incorporated on May 27, 2011 for the limited purpose of taking action necessary to provide for the
issuance of bonds on behalf of the MBTA secured by revenues from the Parking System. The
Corporation maintains its principal legal office at the MBTA, 10 Park Plaza, Suite 3910, Boston,
Massachusetts 02116, although all operations of the Corporation are performed by MBTA staff.
The Corporation is the issuer of the Bonds and has assumed certain rights to receive gross
revenues from the Parking System under the Transfer and Disposition Agreement.
The Corporation is a newly formed entity and has no experience other than with respect to the
Parking Facilities. The Corporation has no employees and has relied, and expects to continue to rely, on
the MBTA and its advisors to the extent set forth in the Transfer and Disposition Agreement and the
Resolution for the performance of its responsibilities with respect to the Bonds.
The obligations of the Corporation under the Resolution, the Bonds and the Transfer and
Disposition Agreement are limited obligations, payable solely from the assets of the Corporation which
are pledged under the Resolution, and recourse to the Corporation shall be limited to such assets. In no
event shall any of the Corporation’s directors, officers or agents be personally responsible for performing
or paying any obligations of the Corporation and no recourse shall be had against any of the
Corporation’s directors, officers or agents, except as a result of his or her fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, willful misconduct or knowing violation of law.
The Articles of Organization of the Corporation (the “Articles of Organization”) permit the
Corporation to engage only in Massachusetts activities permitted by Chapter 180 of Massachusetts
General Laws.
The Articles of Organization prohibit the Corporation from engaging in any business unrelated to
the Bonds or the Parking System or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Corporation, and from
issuing or incurring any indebtedness other than the Bonds and other obligations, including Additional
Bonds, under the Resolution. The Articles of Organization also prohibit the Corporation from filing for
protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
The bylaws of the Corporation (the “Bylaws”) provide that the property, affairs and business of
the Corporation will be managed by its Board of Directors, and, except as otherwise expressly provided
by law, the Articles of Organization or the Bylaws, all the powers of the Corporation will be vested in the
Board of Directors. The MBTA is the sole member of the Corporation. The Board of Directors consists
of three ex officio management employees of the MBTA. Two directors constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business and the act of a majority of voting directors present at a meeting at which a
quorum is present is the act of the Board of Directors. The current directors of the Corporation are set
forth below.

Transit System
The MBTA is the oldest and fifth largest public transit system in the country, operating subway,
trackless trolley, trolley, bus, commuter boat and commuter rail service throughout eastern Massachusetts.
The MBTA is responsible for an estimated 1.24 million passenger trips every business day and operates
over 1,250 route miles.
The service area of the MBTA consists of the 175 towns in eastern Massachusetts, including
Worcester, Massachusetts and communities east thereof, constituting 3,244 square miles and a population
of 4,663,565 (2000 census). Commuter rail service also extends into Rhode Island, terminating at
Providence.
The MBTA system map, excluding buses, is set forth on the inside cover of this Official Statement.
The MBTA operates multiple modes of transit services, including subway, light rail, trackless
trolley, bus, water transportation and paratransit services. In 2010, the MBTA served approximately 1.24
million passengers on a typical weekday, as follows:

The following table shows total fare revenue derived from the MBTA transit system during Fiscal
Year 2010 and allocated by mode. The allocation is based on the sale of fare products, such as monthly
passes, tickets and stored value (CharlieCard) , and actual usage of each fare product during the prior year,
based on farebox and automated fare collection faregate data.

*Excludes water transportation and contracted bus.

The MBTA’s fare policy for the transit system is determined solely by the MBTA Board, not
subject to any legal restrictions, except that any proposed change in fares becomes effective only after
completion of public hearings and review by the MBTA’s advisory board. In addition, in connection with
any systemwide increase in fares of 10% or more, the MBTA Board shall have made findings on the
environmental impact of such increase in fares. After a series of public hearings and in accordance with
the Enabling Act, in early 2007 the Authority implemented a new fare structure, including an overall
increase in fares of approximately 25%. Prior to such increase, there were fare increases in early 2004
and late 2000 with an overall increase in fares of approximately 24.4% and 25%, respectively. The 2000
fare increase was the first increase since 1991.
The MBTA’s current fare structure for certain modes is as follows:
Adult Local Bus
Adult Rapid Transit (Subway/Light Rail/Trolley)
Inner Express Bus
Outer Express Bus
Local Bus + Rapid Transit

For commuter rail, the cash fares range from $1.70 to $7.75, depending on distance travelled.
Monthly passes range from $59 to $149. The commuter boat is $6.00 cash fare and $198 for a monthly
pass.
The business of the Authority is capital intensive. Under the MBTA Enabling Act, the Authority
is required to develop a comprehensive, long-term (not greater than 25 years) Program for Mass Transit
which is implemented through rolling five-year capital investment programs adopted each year (each, a
“CIP”). Total anticipated expenditures under the Authority’s current five year CIP for FY2012-2016
equal approximately $3.8 billion, of which approximately $50.24 million is allocated to fund
improvements to existing Parking Facilities. This amount is in addition to ongoing expenditures for the
completion of new and replacement parking facilities at Beverly Depot, Salem and Wonderland in
Revere, as described below.

14

PARKING SYSTEM
Parking Facilities
The Parking System consists of approximately 44,000 parking spaces at 95 different facilities,
including seven structured garages and 89 surface lots (one facility has both a garage and surface lot), all
of which are owned by the MBTA. The surface lots include large facilities with revenues collected at
booths serviced by attendants and smaller facilities with self-service payment receptacles. The Parking
Facilities serve all modes of the MBTA’s transit system, other than paratransit, including subway, light
rail, trolley, bus, commuter rail and water transportation, all throughout the MBTA’s service area.
The list of Parking Facilities may be decreased by the MBTA only upon satisfaction of certain
conditions set forth in the Transfer and Disposition Agreement, including compliance with certain
financial covenants, or increased by the MBTA. See “TRANSFER AND DISPOSITION AGREEMENT.”

The MBTA and the City of Revere have undertaken a major transit oriented development project at the Wonderland station on the Blue Line, including
construction of a new parking garage that will replace a portion of the two existing surface lots (referred to as “Wonderland” and “Ocean Ave/Wonderland”). The
garage is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. While the development project will result in the “Ocean Ave/Wonderland” surface lot being closed, the
overall net increase for MBTA parking will be approximately 500 spaces. See “-MBTA RESPONSIBILITY FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TO PARKING SYSTEM.”

The Parking System excludes certain smaller lots located on the MBTA’s commuter rail system
that are not owned by the MBTA, the garage at South Station and the North Station garage, which is the
subject of a pending procurement for possible sale or private lease.
The MBTA estimates that approximately 30,000 of its passengers park at MBTA parking facilities
on a typical weekday.
Rates and Charges
Under the MBTA Enabling Act, rates at the Parking Facilities are determined solely and
independently by the MBTA, not subject to any other approvals or oversight process.
The current daily rates and charges at the Parking Facilities generally are $7 at garages, $5 at
attended surface lots and $4 at surface lots with self-pay. Such rates reflect an increase of $2 implemented
in November, 2008. Previously, there were $0.50 increases in the daily rate at rapid transit station locations
in both spring, 2005 and January, 2003. The January, 2003 increase also changed from $1 to $2 the daily
charge at surface lots at commuter rails stations. In 2007, there was an increase of $1.50 in the daily rate at
parking facilities at certain stations on the red line to offset a reduction in fares for service to such stations.
In an effort to move away from cash-based payments and to utilize available technology, the
MBTA has begun to implement other payment options within the Parking System. For example, in July,
2010, the Authority launched its Pay by Phone program, which enables customers at Parking Facilities at
commuter rail, water transportation and certain subway stations to pay from their mobile phones. As of

17

May 1, 2011, there are 19,600 users of the Pay by Phone program. The parking charge for such users is the
same as the cash rate.
In connection with the development of an intermodal station and parking garage at the Route 128
station, which serves both MBTA commuter rail and Amtrak’s Northeast Regional and Acela high-speed
rail service, the MBTA developed a system where parkers may pay for daily or extended parking by use of a
FastLane or E-ZPass transponder. The MBTA’s share of such parking revenues are remitted to the
Authority weekly.
In February, 2011, the MBTA commenced a monthly permit programs for users of self-pay surface
lots. A user purchases a $70 monthly permit online ($35 after the 15th of the month) and posts it in the
vehicle. Use of the pass is limited to one vehicle at one lot.
The MBTA is developing a program to install equipment at certain Parking Facilities that will allow
parkers to utilize the MBTA’s automated fare collection system, known as the CharlieCard, to pay for
parking, at the same price as for cash. The Authority anticipates commencing a pilot program in 2011 at the
parking garages at the Red Line subway stations at Alewife in Cambridge and in Braintree. The Braintree
station also serves commuter rail.
In an effort to address chronic underutilization at certain Parking Facilities, the MBTA is
implementing an alternative pricing structure at certain sites. For example, the daily rate at the self-pay
surface parking facilities at Mattapan and Milton, on the high speed trolley extension of the Red Line
subway, is expected to be reduced to $3 from $4. Alternative pricing programs are also being explored at
the Campello, Halifax, Kingston and Newburyport surface lots.
Enforcement of parking collections also is being enhanced by the MBTA. Commencing July 1,
2011, the late fee for nonpayment of daily charges will be increased to $21 from $1. The MBTA also is
developing a program with MassDOT whereby drivers with unpaid parking balances will be unable to
renew their drivers’ licenses. In Fiscal Year 2010, the operators of the MBTA's parking facilities
collected $779,806 in parking fines. Parking fines constitute “Revenues” under the Resolution. See
“SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS – TRUST ASSETS.”

Revenue Collection System
Daily Deposit of Gross Revenues with the Trustee. Gross revenues from the Parking System are
collected and deposited daily into bank accounts owned and controlled by the MBTA. As illustrated on the
below diagram and described above, Parking System customers may use several methods to pay their
parking fees, including self-pay at cash receptacles, payment to a parking attendant, use of a Pay By Phone
mobile technology, by credit card purchase of a monthly MBTA parking permit, by use of a Fast Lane or EZ Pass transponder or by the stored value CharlieCard.

Regardless of payment method, the gross revenues from the Parking System are deposited daily
(monthly in the case of monthly passes and weekly in the case of FastLane and E-ZPass) into one of seven
MBTA parking bank accounts corresponding to internal groupings used by the MBTA for the purposes of
Parking Facility operations. See “- OPERATION OF THE PARKING SYSTEM.” These moneys are swept daily
into an MBTA Parking Revenue Concentration Account and reviewed by the audit and reconciliation staff
of the MBTA, with a daily report of Parking Revenues produced and circulated to senior officials of the
Authority. Upon and after issuance of the Bonds, Parking System Revenues will be transferred daily to the
Trustee and deposited into the Revenue Fund held by the Trustee and pledged to the Bonds.
As noted above, the Authority also anticipates implementing a pilot program at two Parking
System garages (Alewife and Braintree) that will enable customers to use their MBTA CharlieCard transit
fare card to pay for parking at those two Parking Facilities. Such revenue will be deposited daily into the
MBTA Parking Revenue Concentration Account for daily transfer to the Trustee.

Revenues from Parking Facilities
Gross Revenues from the Parking System have grown from approximately $18.4 million in Fiscal
Year 2002 to approximately $37.6 million in Fiscal 2010. This growth reflects a combination of factors,
including the opening of additional parking spaces related to the expansion of the MBTA’s transit system
(e.g., the Greenbush Line), parking rate increases and overall increases in utilization. According to the
MBTA, estimated gross revenues from the Parking System for Fiscal Year 2011 are expected to total $37.6
million. The MBTA has budgeted gross revenues from the Parking System at approximately $39.9 million
for Fiscal Year 2012.
The following table provides a summary of the actual gross Revenues from the Parking Facilities
for Fiscal years 2002 through 2010, projected gross Revenues for Fiscal Year 2011 and budgeted gross
Revenues for Fiscal Year 2012.

In December, 2007, the MBTA entered into new management contracts for its parking facilities, which
provide for the operators’ collection and remittance to the MBTA of the gross amount of parking revenues.
Prior to such contract, the parking facilities were managed by one operator under a lease arrangement
providing for the retention of all revenues by the operator, who paid the MBTA a net amount.
(4)
Projected, based on actual, unaudited results through April 30, 2011.

Estimated, based on MBTA Fiscal Year 2012 operating budget.

The historical gross revenues from the Parking Facilities show limited, month-to-month seasonality,
with revenues in the winter months January and February in recent years only modestly lower than revenues
in other months. During both Fiscal Year 2010 and Fiscal Year 2011 to date, for example, monthly
revenues from the Parking Facilities were approximately $2.8 million per month in both January and
February, as compared to an average of $3.1 million for the year and year-to-date, with a high of
approximately $3.5 million in both March and April of 2010 and 2011, respectively.
Factors Affecting Parking System Revenues
The level of Revenues generated by the Parking System varies based on ridership levels on the
MBTA’s transit system. Ridership is affected by numerous factors, including transit fare and Parking
System rate levels, service area population size and growth, visitor volumes, downtown parking rates,
general economic conditions, employment and the impact of fuel prices on commuter choices between

20

taking public transit or driving to work, among other factors. For example, the MBTA reported an increase
in ridership and experienced an increase in Parking System utilization in the summer and fall of 2008, at a
time when fuel prices increased significantly, and has also recently reported ridership increases in the spring
of 2011 during another period of rising fuel prices. Similarly, when the Authority raised transit fares (but
not parking rates) in 2004, both transit system ridership and Parking System revenues fell slightly in 2005
when compared to the prior year. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not materially
adversely affect the future level of Revenues generated by the Parking Facilities.
Operation of the Parking System
Each of the Parking Facilities is managed under one of eight different management contracts (the
“Management Agreements”), which expire December 1, 2012 and have substantially similar terms. Four of
such contracts are with LAZ Parking Limited, LLC (“LAZ”), and LAZ also serves as subcontractor to AIM
Parking Management LLC pursuant to two additional Management Agreements. Each of Ampco System
Parking (formerly Five Star Parking) and Kinney System Inc. (d/b/a/ Central Parking System of
Massachusetts) also operates a group of Parking Facilities under a Management Agreement. See Appendix
A for a list of Parking Facilities, including the operator thereof, as of May, 2011.
LAZ is a national parking company, headquartered in Hartford, CT, with regional offices in Atlanta,
Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. In existence for
over 29 years, LAZ reports that it has over 425,000 parking spaces under management in 21 states and does
business in excess of $500 million in annual revenues. LAZ's parking portfolio reportedly includes Class A
office buildings, mixed use projects, hotels, hospitals and medical complexes, stand alone garages, surface
lots, valet parking sites, concierge services, transportation intermodals, major entertainment/event parking,
and university parking.
Central Parking System identifies itself as the leader in professional parking management. The
company reports having offices in all major metropolitan areas in the United States and operates more than
2,500 parking facilities containing 1.2 million spaces.
AMPCO System Parking is a subsidiary of ABM Industries and reportedly manages more than
1,800 office and multi-use parking operations across the country for airports, colleges and universities,
municipalities, hospitals and medical centers. Ampco System Parking reports providing a wide range of
services, including parking management, parking enforcement and customer parking operations surveys.
The MBTA selected these parking operators in 2007 pursuant to a solicitation of 37 national and
local providers. With the expiration of the existing management contracts on December 1, 2012, the MBTA
expects to commence a new solicitation process in the summer of 2011, to put in place new three-to-fiveyear agreements with one or more qualified operators on similar terms as the existing Management
Agreements. There can be no assurance that the current operators of the Parking System will continue as
the operators following completion of that open and competitive procurement process.
Under the Management Agreements, each operator is responsible for the daily operation of the
parking facilities subject to its respective contract, including collecting and enforcing revenues, directing
traffic and monitoring the facilities. While the MBTA remains responsible for major capital improvements
to the Parking Facilities, the operators must provide routine cleaning and maintenance, including cleaning
and maintaining drains, booths, gates and surface areas, re-striping, trash collection and removal, landscape
maintenance and snow removal. The operators also collect, secure and deposit gross revenues received at
the attendant booths or cash receptacles and deposit such amounts daily into MBTA bank accounts. The
operators must provide daily reports on revenue collection, capacity and maintenance.

21

Payments to the operators under the Management Agreements are made by the MBTA from its
general funds, and are not netted from gross revenues of the Parking Facilities collected by the operators.
For the twelve-month period ending April 30, 2011, the MBTA paid approximately $8.6 million from its
general operating funds to the operators under the Management Agreements. Under the Management
Agreements, the operators must remit the gross revenues from the Parking Facilities daily and have no right
of offset against parking revenues for the payment of their fees or other amounts owed to the operators. The
Management Agreements each provide that an operator may be terminated by the MBTA at the Authority’s
option upon 30 days notice to the operator or immediately upon a default by an operator on its obligations
under its respective agreement.
Under the Transfer and Disposition Agreement, the MBTA remains responsible for the operation of
the Parking Facilities and for the payment from MBTA general funds of the operators, and for capital
improvements at the Parking System facilities.
MBTA Responsibility for Capital Improvements to Parking System
Under the Transfer and Disposition Agreement, the MBTA remains responsible for all capital
improvements to the Parking Facilities and any expansion of its parking facilities. The MBTA’s CIP for
Fiscal Years 2012-2016 includes approximately $50.24 million allocated to fund improvements to existing
Parking Facilities.
While expansion of parking facilities is not a priority of the MBTA’s CIP, the MBTA has
undertaken expansion of certain existing parking facilities that are part of the Parking System. In particular,
construction is underway on a new 1,464-space parking garage at the Wonderland subway station on the
Blue Line, also served by buses. The garage, which is part of a larger transit oriented development at the
site, will replace a portion of the existing surface parking lots, will provide a net increase of approximately
500 spaces for MBTA parking and is expected to be placed in service in late 2012.
In connection with a transit oriented development at the Riverside station on the Green Line, the
MBTA has entered into a ground lease with a private developer pursuant to which the developer will
construct a parking garage at the Riverside station. This garage will replace the existing surface lot and
provide a net increase in parking spaces for MBTA parking. Under the ground lease, the surface lot will not
be taken out of service until the garage is in operation.
The MBTA also is developing plans to expand parking at the commuter rail stations in Beverly and
Salem through the addition of parking garages. The existing 340-space surface parking lot at the commuter
rail station in Salem, which also is served by bus, may be replaced with an 800-space parking garage in
December, 2014. Similarly, the existing 100-space surface lot at the Beverly Depot commuter rail station
may be replaced with a 485-space parking garage in October, 2013.
Competition
The MBTA owns the Parking System and faces some competition in providing parking spaces
contiguous to its public transit system station stops. The vast majority of the Parking Facilities are located
in or immediately adjacent to its transit facility stations. MBTA system riders have the ability to park
elsewhere at other nearby locations and walk to the transit system or use alternative means of travel within
the MBTA’s service area, including driving. For those commuting to downtown Boston by car, parking
rates vary widely, with the published daily rates at 28 commercial garages as of May 15, 2011 ranging from
$20 to $40 and averaging in excess of $30, and certain surface lots in the Seaport District area charging $12
per day. Since 1976, the City of Boston has maintained a “freeze” on public, off-street parking in

22

downtown Boston which limits the development of additional parking in the area, although there is no
guaranty that such program will continue in its current form.
LEGAL INVESTMENTS AND SECURITY FOR DEPOSITS
Under the Enabling Act, the Bonds are made securities in which all public officers and public
bodies of the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, trust companies,
banking associations, savings banks, cooperative banks, investment companies, executors, trustees and other
fiduciaries, and all other persons whatsoever who are now or may hereafter be authorized to invest in bonds
or notes or other obligations of a similar nature may properly and legally invest funds, including capital,
deposits or other funds in their control or belonging to them. The Bonds are thereby made securities which
may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or
political subdivision of the Commonwealth for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or other
obligations of the Commonwealth now or may hereafter be authorized by law.
LITIGATION
On the date of issuance of the Bonds, an opinion will be delivered by counsel to the Corporation
and the MBTA to the effect that to such counsel’s knowledge no litigation or other legal action is pending
or threatened wherein an unfavorable ruling or finding could adversely affect the enforceability of the
documents entered into by, or the operations (financial or otherwise) of, such parties or the validity of the
Bonds or the pledge or application of the Revenues, or which contests such party’s or parties’ powers or
authority with respect to the foregoing.
TAX MATTERS
Bond Counsel is of the opinion that, under existing law, interest on the Bonds will not be
included in the gross income of holders of the Bonds for federal income tax purposes. This opinion is
expressly conditioned upon continued compliance with certain requirements imposed by the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which must be satisfied subsequent to the date of
issuance of the Bonds in order to ensure that interest on the Bonds is and continues to be excludable from
the gross income of holders of the Bonds. Failure to comply with certain of such requirements could
cause interest on the Bonds to be included in the gross income of holders of the Bonds retroactive to the
date of issuance of the Bonds. In particular, and without limitation, these requirements include
restrictions on the use, expenditure and investment of Bond proceeds and the payment of rebate, or
penalties in lieu of rebate, to the United States, subject to certain exceptions. The Corporation has
provided covenants and certificates as to continued compliance with such requirements.
In the opinion of Bond Counsel, under existing law, since the Bonds are not “private activity
bonds” under the Code, interest on the Bonds will not constitute a preference item under Section 57(a)(5)
of the Code for purposes of computation of the alternative minimum tax imposed on certain individuals
and corporations under Section 55 of the Code. However, interest on the Bonds will be included in
“adjusted current earnings” of corporate holders of the Bonds and therefore will be taken into account
under Section 56(g) of the Code in the computation of the alternative minimum tax applicable to certain
corporations.
Bond Counsel has not opined as to any other matters of federal tax law relating to the Bonds.
However, prospective purchasers should be aware of certain collateral consequences which may result
under federal tax law for certain holders of the Bonds: (i) Section 265 of the Code denies a deduction for
interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry the Bonds or, in the case of a financial
institution, that portion of a holder’s interest expense allocated to interest on the Bonds, (ii) with respect
23

to insurance companies subject to the tax imposed by Section 831 of the Code, Section 832(b)(5)(B)(i)
reduces the deduction for losses incurred by 15 percent of the sum of certain items, including interest on
the Bonds, (iii) interest on the Bonds earned by certain foreign corporations doing business in the United
States could be subject to a branch profits tax imposed by Section 884 of the Code, (iv) passive
investment income, including interest on the Bonds, may be subject to federal income taxation under
Section 1375 of the Code for an S Corporation that has Subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of
the taxable year if greater than 25% of the gross receipts of such S Corporation is passive investment
income, (v) Section 86 of the Code requires recipients of certain Social Security and certain Railroad
Retirement benefits to take into account in determining gross income receipts or accruals of interest on
the Bonds, and (vi) receipt of investment income, including interest on the Bonds, may, pursuant to
Section 32(i) of the Code, disqualify the recipient from obtaining the earned income credit provided by
Section 32(a) of the Code.
Bond Counsel has not undertaken to advise in the future whether any events after the date of
issuance of the Bonds may affect the tax exempt status of interest on the Bonds or the tax consequences
of ownership of the Bonds. No assurance can be given that future legislation, or amendments to the
Code, if enacted into law, will not contain provisions which could directly or indirectly reduce the benefit
of the exclusion of the interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
Interest paid on tax-exempt obligations such as the Bonds is now generally required to be
reported by payors to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and to recipients in the same manner as
interest on taxable obligations. In addition, such interest may be subject to “backup withholding” if the
Bond owner fails to provide the information required on IRS Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer
Identification Number and Certification, or the IRS has specifically identified the Bond owner as being
subject to backup withholding because of prior underreporting. Neither the information reporting
requirement nor the backup withholding requirement affects the excludability of interest on the Bonds
from gross income for federal tax purposes.
In the opinion of Bond Counsel, under existing law, interest on the Bonds is exempt from
Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property
taxes. Bond Counsel has not opined as to other Massachusetts tax consequences arising with respect to
the Bonds. Prospective purchasers should be aware, however, that the Bonds are included in the measure
of Massachusetts estate and inheritance taxes, and the Bonds and the interest thereon are included in the
measure of Massachusetts corporate excise and franchise taxes. Bond Counsel has not opined as to the
taxability of the Bonds or the income therefrom under the laws of any state other than Massachusetts.
For federal and Massachusetts income tax purposes, interest includes original issue discount,
which with respect to a Bond is equal to the excess, if any, of the stated redemption price at maturity of
such Bond over the initial offering price thereof to the public, excluding underwriters and other
intermediaries, at which price a substantial amount of all such Bonds with the same maturity was sold.
Original issue discount accrues actuarially over the term of a Bond. Holders should consult their own tax
advisers with respect to the computations of original issue discount during the period in which any such
Bond is held.
An amount equal to the excess, if any, of the purchase price of a Bond over the principal amount
payable at maturity constitutes amortizable bond premium for federal and Massachusetts tax purposes.
The required amortization of such premium during the term of a Bond will result in reduction of the
holder’s tax basis on such Bond. Such amortization also will result in reduction of the amount of the
stated interest on the Bond taken into account as interest for tax purposes. Holders of Bonds purchased at
a premium should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the determination and treatment of such

24

premium for federal income tax purposes and with respect to the state or local tax consequences of
owning such Bonds.
On the date of delivery of the Bonds, the Underwriters will be furnished with an opinion of Bond
Counsel substantially in the form attached hereto. See Appendix B -- Proposed Form of Opinion of
Bond Counsel.
RATINGS
The Bonds have been assigned long-term ratings of “A1” and “A+” by Moody’s Investors
Service and Standard & Poor’s, respectively.
Such ratings reflect only the respective views of such organizations, and an explanation of the
significance of such ratings may be obtained from the rating agency furnishing the same. There is no
assurance that a rating will continue for any given period of time or that a rating will not be revised or
withdrawn entirely by any or all of such rating agencies, if, in its or their judgment, circumstances so
warrant. Any downward revision or withdrawal of a rating could have an adverse effect on the market
prices of the Bonds.
CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS
Legal matters incident to the authorization, issuance and sale of the Bonds are subject to the
approval of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., Boston, Massachusetts, Bond Counsel.
The approving opinions of Bond Counsel in substantially the forms attached hereto as Appendix D will
be delivered with the Bonds. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the Underwriters by
Greenberg Traurig, LLP, Boston, Massachusetts.
UNDERWRITING
The Underwriters, for whom Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is acting as representative, have
agreed, subject to certain conditions, to purchase from the Corporation the Bonds at a discount from the
initial offering price of the Bonds equal to $2,045,223.69. The initial public offering price of the Bonds
may be changed from time to time by the Underwriters. The Underwriters will be obligated to purchase
all Bonds if any such Bonds are purchased.
The following language has been provided by the underwriters named therein. The MBTA takes no
responsibility as to the accuracy or completeness thereof.
Citigroup Inc., parent company of Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., has entered into a retail
brokerage joint venture with Morgan Stanley. As part of the joint venture, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
will distribute municipal securities to retail investors through the financial advisor network of a new brokerdealer, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC. This distribution arrangement became effective on June 1,
2009. As part of this arrangement, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. will compensate Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney LLC for its selling efforts with respect to the Bonds.
Pershing LLC, a subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, and Barclays Capital
Inc. established a strategic alliance in May of 2009, which enables Pershing LLC to participate as a
selling group member and a retail distributor for all new issue municipal bond offerings underwritten by
Barclays Capital Inc., including the Bonds offered hereby. Pershing LLC will receive a selling
concession from Barclays Capital Inc. in connection with its distribution activities relating to the Bonds.
25

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“JPMS”), one of the Underwriters of the Bonds, has entered into
negotiated dealer agreements (each, a “Dealer Agreement”) with each of UBS Financial Services Inc.
(“UBSFS”) and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (“CS&Co.”) for the retail distribution of certain securities
offerings at the original issue prices. Pursuant to each Dealer Agreement (if applicable to this transaction),
each of UBSFS and CS&Co. will purchase Bonds from JPMS at the original issue price less a negotiated
portion of the selling concession applicable to any Bonds that such firm sells.
Fidelity Capital Markets (“FCM”), one of the underwriters of the Bonds, is a division of National
Financial Services LLC (“NFS”), which provides fully-disclosed clearing and other services to
correspondent broker-dealers (the “correspondent broker-dealers”). NFS has entered into Master
Reallowance Agreements with several of the correspondent broker-dealers to allow them to redistribute
municipal securities underwritten by NFS to their retail investors at the original offering price. Pursuant to
these Master Reallowance Agreements, NFS may share a portion of the underwriting compensation with
respect to this bond offering with its correspondent broker-dealers.
CONTINUING DISCLOSURE
In order to assist the Underwriters in complying with Rule 15c2-12(b)(5) promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Rule”), the Corporation will enter into a Continuing
Disclosure Agreement with the Trustee for the benefit of owners of the Bonds setting forth the
undertaking of the Corporation regarding continuing disclosure with respect to the Bonds. The proposed
Continuing Disclosure Undertaking is set forth in APPENDIX E. The Corporation has made no prior
continuing disclosure undertakings under the Rule.
MISCELLANEOUS
The summaries of the provisions of the Bonds and the Bond Resolution contained herein do not
purport to be complete and are made subject to the detailed provisions thereof to which reference is hereby
made. Copies of the form of the Bonds and the Bond Resolution are available for inspection at the offices
of the Corporation and the Trustee.
Information relating to DTC and the book-entry system described in APPENDIX F has been
furnished by DTC. None of the Corporation, the MBTA or the Underwriters make any representations or
warranties whatsoever with respect to such information.
It is anticipated that the Corporation will be a blended component unit of the MBTA for financial
reporting purposes. Given this and because the Corporation was only formed recently and has had no assets
or revenues until the issuance of the Bonds and the execution of the Transfer and Disposition Agreement,
the Corporation has not prepared any financial statements, nor does it expect to prepare separate financial
statements. Under the Transfer and Disposition Agreement, the MBTA has agreed to include in its annual
financial statements and report of an independent public accountant or firm of accountants, commencing
with the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2012, information about the Corporation, the Revenues, the Bonds and
the Debt Service Reserve Fund during such Fiscal Year.
U.S. Bank National Association by acceptance of its duties as Trustee under the Bond Resolution
has not reviewed this Official Statement and makes no representations as to the information contained
herein, including but not limited to, any representations as to the use of the proceeds of the Bonds or related
activities.

26

The execution and delivery of this Official Statement has been duly authorized by the Corporation.

Until March, 2011, the Town of Needham managed certain surface parking lots on the Needham Heights commuter rail line,
collected all parking revenues derived from such lots and submitted net revenues to the MBTA on a monthly basis. As of March,
2011, the MBTA owns and manages such lots under a Management Agreement with LAZ Parking, with gross parking revenues
collected and deposited in the same manner as the other Parking Facilities.

(2) The MBTA and the City of Revere have undertaken a major transit oriented development project at the Wonderland station on the
Blue Line, including construction of a new parking garage that will replace a portion of the two existing surface lots (referred to as
“Wonderland” and “Ocean Ave/Wonderland”). The garage is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. While the development
project will result in the “Ocean Ave/Wonderland” surface lot being closed, the overall net increase for MBTA parking will be
approximately 500 spaces. See “PARKING SYSTEM - MBTA RESPONSIBILITY FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TO PARKING SYSTEM.”
(3)Total may not add due to rounding.

Additional Security for the Bonds
The Issuer may obtain letters of credit, lines of credit, insurance or similar obligations,

such Additional Security. In connection therewith the Issuer may enter into such agreements with the
issuer of or obligor on such Additional Security providing for, the payment of fees and expenses for the

B-7

of amounts payable under the terms of such Additional Security and application of such amounts as
provided in the agreements providing therefor, may be on a parity with the lien created by the Resolution.
So long as no amounts shall be paid under such Additional Security and such Reimbursement Obligations
shall remain contingent, such Reimbursement Obligations shall not be taken in account hereof under the
provisions of the additional bonds test or the Covenant as to Authority Revenues of the Resolution,
provided the issuer of or obligor on such Additional Security may be deemed a Holder thereunder,
including the Holder of all Bonds secured thereby, for the purposes of voting, giving consents, receiving
notices and otherwise as may be specified in the applicable Supplemental Resolution. Upon the payment
of amounts under the Additional Security which results in a Reimbursement Obligation becoming due

purposes of he additional bonds test or the Covenant as to Authority Revenues of the Resolution and for
such other purposes thereunder as may be specified in the applicable Supplemental Resolution. (Section

benefit of the Bonds. Funds on deposit in the Debt Service Reserve Fund shall be excluded from the
Trust Assets pledged for the benefit of such Subordinated Bonds and shall not be applied to the payment
of principal of or interest on such Subordinated Bonds. The Supplemental Resolution with respect to any
Subordinated Bonds may establish separate reserves for the benefit of such Subordinated Bonds (which
may be excluded from the Trust Assets pledged for the benefit of Bonds), shall specify the terms and
conditions applicable to such Subordinated Bonds. Subordinated Bonds may bear interest at a fixed rate
or rates of interest or at variable, adjustable or convertible rates of interest, as specified in the
Supplemental Resolution with respect to such Subordinated Bonds. (Section 207)
General Terms and Provisions of the Bonds:
Payment of the Bonds
The Bonds of each Series shall be payable in any legal tender of the United States. The interest
on any Bonds will be paid as specified in the applicable Supplemental Resolution. The Issuer may make
provisions in the applicable Supplemental Resolution with respect to record dates for purposes of
determining registered Holders for purposes of paying interest on any Bond.
Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Supplemental Resolutions the Bonds of each Series
shall be issued in the form of fully registered bonds without coupons payable to a named person or
registered assigns. All Bonds shall each be in the denomination of $5,000 or any whole multiple thereof
and shall be in the form provided in the applicable Supplemental Resolution. The Issuer may provide in
the applicable Supplemental Resolution for the issuance of the Bonds so authorized in book-entry form or
in denominations less or more than $5,000 upon the terms and conditions set forth therein.
Bonds of each Series shall be dated as of the date or dates provided in the applicable
Supplemental Resolution. Unless otherwise provided in the Supplemental Resolution, all Bonds of each
Series shall bear interest from their date. (Section 301)
Negotiability, Transfer, and Registry of the Bonds
All the Bonds issued under the Resolution shall be negotiable, subject to the provisions for
registration and transfer contained in the Resolution and in the Bonds. The Issuer shall maintain and

and upon presentation the Issuer shall register the Bonds or cause them to be registered, and permit to be
transferred, under such reasonable regulations as may be prescribed by the Supplemental Resolution, any
Bond entitled to registration or transfer.
Each Bond shall be transferable only upon the books of the Issuer in the manner provided in the
form of such Bonds. As to any Bond, the Issuer and each Fiduciary may deem and treat the person in
whose name the Bond shall be registered upon the books of the Issuer as the absolute owner of such
Bond, whether such Bond shall be overdue or not for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account
of, the Principal Amount or Redemption Price of and interest on such Bond and for all other purposes,
and neither the Issuer nor any Fiduciary shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. The Issuer, to the
extent permitted by law, agrees to indemnify and each Fiduciary from any and all loss, expense, judgment
of liability incurred by it, acting in good faith and without gross negligence hereunder, in so treating such
registered owner.
All Bonds surrendered in any exchange or transfer of Bonds shall be cancelled by the
Authenticating Agent. (Section 305)
Redemption of the Bonds:
Whenever by the terms of the Resolution and the applicable Supplemental Resolution Bonds of a
Series are required to be redeemed otherwise than at the election of the Issuer, the Trustee shall select the
Bonds to be redeemed, give the notice of redemption and pay out of the moneys available therefor the
Redemption Price to the appropriate Paying Agents. (Section 403)
When the Trustee shall receive notice from the Issuer of its election to redeem Bonds and when
redemption of Bonds is required by the Resolution and the applicable Supplemental Resolution the
Trustee shall give notice, in the name of the Issuer, of the redemption of such Bonds, which shall specify
the Series and maturities of the Bonds to be redeemed, the redemption date and the place or places where
amounts due upon such redemption will be payable, any conditions to such redemption, and, if less than
all of the Bonds of any like Series and maturity are to be redeemed, the letters and numbers or other
distinguishing marks of such Bonds to be redeemed. The Trustee shall mail a copy of the notice, at least
30 days before the redemption date to the Holders of any Bonds or portions of Bonds which are to be
redeemed. Failure to mail notice to any one Holder or any defect in such notice shall not affect the
validity of the proceedings for the redemption of Bonds owned by any other Holder to whom the required
notice has been given, nor shall the Trustee bear any liability in connection therewith. (Section 405)
In the case of any redemption of Bonds other than as provided above, the Issuer shall give written
notice to the Trustee of its election to redeem, of the redemption date, of the Series and of the Principal
Amount of the Bonds of each maturity of such Series to be redeemed (which Series, maturities and
Principal Amount shall be determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, subject to any limitations
contained in the Resolution and any Supplemental Resolution). Notice shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption date or such shorter period as shall be acceptable to the Trustee. The
Trustee shall, on or before the redemption date, pay out of the moneys available therefor to the
appropriate Paying Agent or Paying Agents an amount which, will be sufficient to redeem on the
redemption date at the Redemption Price thereof, all of the Bonds to be redeemed. (Section 402)
Except as otherwise provided in a Supplemental Resolution with respect to a particular Series of
Bonds, in the event of redemption of less than all the Outstanding Bonds of like Series, maturity or, in the
case of term bonds, Sinking Fund Payments, the Trustee shall select by lot, in such manner in its
discretion as it shall deem appropriate and fair, the numbers of the Bonds to be redeemed and the portions
of any thereof to be redeemed in part. Bonds of denominations of more than the applicable minimum
denomination, if any, may be redeemed either as a whole or in part (which part must be in the amount of
B-9

the applicable minimum denomination, if any, or an integral multiple thereof). Bonds, or portions
thereof, which have theretofore been selected for redemption shall not be deemed Outstanding for such
purpose. (Section 404)
Bonds called for redemption shall become due and payable on the redemption date at the
Redemption Price, plus interest, if any, accrued and unpaid to the redemption date. (Section 406)

securities in all funds and accounts established by or pursuant to the Resolution except the Rebate Fund,
if established, and (iii) all right, title and interest of the Issuer in the Transfer and Disposition Agreement.
The Bonds and Subordinated Bonds shall be limited obligations of the Issuer payable solely from the
Revenues and funds and accounts pledged hereunder. The Bonds and Subordinated Bonds and the

Revenues and funds pledged hereunder. Neither the Authority nor the Commonwealth or any political
subdivision thereof or city or town therein shall be obligated to pay the Bonds or Subordinated Bonds,
and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision
thereof or city or town therein is pledged to the payment of the Bonds or Subordinated Bonds. (Section

Resolution,, shall be collected by or for the account of the Issuer in accordance with the Transfer and
Disposition Agreement and deposited by or on behalf of the Issuer as promptly as practicable in the
Revenue Fund. There shall also be deposited in the Revenue Fund any other moneys so directed by the
Resolution and any other moneys of the Issuer which the Issuer may in its discretion determine to so
apply unless required to be otherwise applied by the Resolution. On or before the 25th day of each
calendar month, beginning with July, 2011, the Trustee shall apply amounts available in the Revenue
Fund to the following purposes and in the following order:
(i)

To the Debt Service Fund, an amount which, when added to other amounts on
deposit in such Fund and available for such purpose, including amounts in the
Capitalized Interest Account, if any, so that the balance in said Fund shall equal
the Debt Service Requirement accrued or accruing up to and including the last
Business Day of such month; and

(ii)

Subject to the Resolution, to the Debt Service Reserve Fund, an amount which,
together with the amounts on deposit therein, will equal the Debt Service Reserve
Fund Requirement as of the first day of the next ensuing month.

Any balance remaining in the Revenue Fund following the above payments shall be used to pay
Issuer Administrative Expenses, if any, or retained in the Revenue Fund to be available for payments
therefrom in the succeeding months, with the balance of such Revenues transferred to the Authority.
(Section 503)

B-10

Debt Service Fund
The Trustee shall pay out of the Debt Service Fund, in accordance with a certificate of the Issuer,
to the respective Paying Agent (i) on each interest payment date the amount required for the interest and
Principal Installments payable on such date and (ii) on each redemption date for any Bonds, other than a
redemption date on account of Sinking Fund Payments, the amount required for the payment of interest
on the Bonds then to be redeemed; the Issuer may direct the Trustee to make such payments to the Paying
Agents prior to the due date as the Issuer determines. The Paying Agents shall apply such amounts to the
payment of interest and Principal Installments on and after the due dates thereof. If on an interest
payment date the amount in the Debt Service Fund for either purpose exceeds the amount required
therefor, the Issuer may direct the Trustee to deposit the excess in the Redemption Fund orin the Revenue
Fund. The Trustee shall also pay out of the Debt Service Fund, in accordance with a certificate of the
Issuer, accrued interest included in the purchase price of Bonds purchased for retirement under any
provision of the Resolution.
Amounts accumulated in the Debt Service Fund with respect to any Sinking Fund Payment
(together with amounts accumulated therein with respect to interest on the Bonds for which such Sinking
Fund Payment was established), if directed by the Issuer, shall be applied by the Trustee prior to the 45th
day preceding the due date of the Sinking Fund Payment, to (i) the purchase of Bonds of the Series and
maturity for which such Sinking Fund Payment was established, at prices not exceeding the applicable
sinking fund Redemption Price plus interest on such Bonds to the first date on which such Bonds could be
redeemed (or in the case of a Sinking Fund Payment due on the maturity date, the Principal Amount
thereof plus interest to such date), such purchases to be made as directed by the Issuer or otherwise as the
Trustee shall determine, or (ii) the redemption, pursuant to the Resolution, of Bonds then redeemable by
their terms. The applicable Redemption Price or Principal Amount (in the case of maturing Bonds) of any
Bonds so purchased or redeemed shall be deemed to constitute part of the Debt Service Fund until such
Sinking Fund Payment date for the purpose of calculating the amount of such Fund. As soon as
practicable after the 45th day preceding the due date of any such Sinking Fund Payment, the Trustee shall
proceed to call for redemption on the due date Bonds of the Series and maturity for which such Sinking
Fund Payment was established (except in the case of Bonds maturing on a Sinking Fund Payment date) in
such amount as shall be necessary to complete the retirement of the Principal Amount of the Bonds of
such Series and maturity as specified for such Sinking Fund Payment in the applicable Supplemental
Resolution, and whether or not the balance in the Debt Service Fund is sufficient to pay all such Bonds.
The Trustee shall pay out of the Debt Service Fund to the appropriate Paying Agents, the amount required
for the redemption of the Bonds called for redemption or for the payment of Bonds then maturing.
In satisfaction, in whole or in part, of any amount required to be paid into the Debt Service Fund
pursuant to the Resolution which is attributable to a Sinking Fund Payment, there may be delivered on
behalf of the Issuer to the Trustee Bonds of the Series and maturity entitled to such payment. .
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Trustee shall not purchase or accept Bonds in lieu
of any Sinking Fund Payment during the period of 45 days prior to the due date of any Sinking Fund
Payment.
The Issuer may establish in any Supplemental Resolution a separate account (herein called
“Capitalized Interest Account”) within the Debt Service Fund and may deposit in the Capitalized Interest
Account any proceeds of Bonds as directed by such Supplemental Resolution and any other moneys not
otherwise directed to be applied by the Resolution. Amounts in the Capitalized Interest Account shall be
applied to the payment of interest on the Bonds and as otherwise provided in the applicable Supplemental
Resolution. (Section 504)

B-11

Redemption Fund.
The Issuer may deposit in the Redemption Fund any moneys, including Revenues, not otherwise
required by the Resolution to be deposited or applied elsewhere. If at any time the amount on deposit and
available in the Debt Service Fund is insufficient to pay the Principal Installments and Redemption Price
of and interest on the Bonds then due, the Trustee shall withdraw from the Redemption Fund and deposit
in the Debt Service Fund the amount necessary to meet the deficiency. Amounts in the Redemption
Fund may be applied by the Issuer to the redemption of Bonds in accordance with the Resolution or to the
purchase of Bonds at prices not exceeding the applicable Redemption Prices (plus accrued interest) had
such Bonds been redeemed (or, if not then subject to redemption, at the applicable Redemption Prices
when next subject to redemption), such purchases to be made by the Trustee at such times and in such
manner as directed in writing by the Issuer. (Section 505)
Debt Service Reserve Fund
If at any time the amounts on deposit and available therefor in the Debt Service Fund, after
transfers from the Redemption Fund are insufficient to pay the Principal Installments and Redemption
Price of and interest on the Bonds then due, the Trustee shall withdraw from the Debt Service Reserve
Fund and deposit in the Debt Service Fund the amount necessary to meet any such deficiency. The
Trustee shall determine the amount of cash and Permitted Investments on deposit in the Debt Service
Reserve Fund on each interest payment date for the Bonds after any withdrawals have been made on such
date. Whenever the Trustee shall determine that the cash and Permitted Investments on deposit in the
Debt Service Reserve Fund together with all other funds available for the purpose is equal to or in excess
of the Redemption Price of all Bonds Outstanding, the Trustee, at the direction of the Issuer, shall transfer
the balance of such cash and Permitted Investments from the Debt Service Reserve Fund to the
Redemption Fund in connection with the redemption of all Bonds Outstanding.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Resolution or any Supplemental Resolution, if a
withdrawal is made from the Debt Service Reserve Fund pursuant to the Resolution or in the event that
the Issuer shall not be in compliance with Debt Service Reserve Requirement, monthly deposits shall be
made to the Debt Service Reserve Fund pursuant to the Resolution on or before the 25th day of the month
in which the withdrawal is made and on or before the 25th day of each of the five succeeding months in an
amount equal to one-sixth (1/6) of the amount of such withdrawal. Until that requirement is met, the
differences between the amount of such withdrawals or draws and the amount redeposited or restored to
the Debt Service Reserve Fund on account of such withdrawal or draws shall be deemed to be on deposit
in the Debt Service Reserve Fund for purposes of calculating the monthly payments to be made to the
Revenue Fund. (Section 506)
Rebate Fund
If any Series of Bonds or Subordinated Bonds is issued, or becomes, subject to the rebate
requirement of Section 148(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Issuer may, by
Supplemental Resolution, activate the Rebate Fund established by the Resolution, and the Trustee shall
then establish a separate Rebate Account within the Rebate Fund for such Series of Bonds or
Subordinated Bonds. Funds on deposit in any Rebate Account shall be applied as set forth in the
applicable Supplemental Resolution. (Section 507)
Investments
Except as otherwise provided in the Resolution, money held for the credit of any fund or account
held by the Trustee under the Resolution shall, to the fullest extent practicable, be invested, either alone or
jointly with moneys in any other fund or account, by the Trustee at the of the Issuer in Permitted

B-12

Investments which shall mature or be redeemable at the option of the holder thereof, on such dates and in
such amounts as may be necessary to provide moneys to meet the payments from such funds and
accounts; provided that if moneys in two or more funds or accounts are commingled for purposes of
investments, the Trustee shall maintain appropriate records of the Permitted Investments or portions
thereof held for the credit of such fund or account. Unless otherwise directed by any Supplemental
Resolution, Permitted Investments purchased as an investment of moneys in any fund or account shall be
deemed at all times to be a part of such fund or account and all income thereon shall accrue to and be
deposited in such fund or account and all losses from investment shall be charged against such fund or
account; provided that all income earned on investment of the Debt Service Fund, the Redemption Fund
and the Debt Service Reserve Fund shall be credited to and deposited in the Revenue Fund.
Notwithstanding any provision therein or in a Supplemental Resolution to the contrary, the Trustee shall
not be liable for any losses from investment in accordance with the Resolution. The Issuer may by
Supplemental Resolution direct that all or any portion of income earned on investment of moneys
allocable to any Series of Bonds in any fund or account established hereunder shall be transferred to the
Rebate Account established for such Series of Bonds pursuant to the Resolution.
In computing the amount in any fund or account hereunder for any purpose, Permitted
Investments shall be valued at amortized cost. As used herein the term “amortized cost,” when used with
respect to an obligation purchased at a premium above or a discount below par, means the value as of any
given time obtained by dividing the total premium or discount at which such obligation was purchased by
the number of days remaining to maturity on such obligation at the date of such purchase and by
multiplying the amount thus calculated by the number of days having passed since such purchase; and (i)
in the case of an obligation purchased at a premium by deducting the product thus obtained from the
purchase price, and (ii) in the case of an obligation purchased at a discount by adding the product thus
obtained to the purchase price. Unless otherwise provided in the Resolution, Permitted Investments in
any fund or account hereunder shall be valued at least once in each Fiscal Year on the last day thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Permitted Investments in the Debt Service Reserve Fund shall be valued
at amortized cost for all purposes of the Resolution unless and until a withdrawal from such Fund shall be
required in accordance with the Resolution in which event such investments shall thereafter be valued at
amortized cost or market, whichever is lower, until the balance in such Fund, on the basis of such
valuation, shall equal the Debt Service Reserve Fund Requirement. (Section 508)
Particular Covenants of the Issuer:
Powers as to Bonds and Pledge
The Issuer is authorized under all applicable laws to create and issue the Bonds and to adopt the
Resolution and to pledge the Revenues and other moneys, securities, funds and other property purported
to be pledged by the Resolution in the manner and to the extent provided in the Resolution. The
Revenues and other moneys, securities, funds and other property so pledged are and will be free and clear
of any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance thereon with respect thereto prior to, or of equal rank with, the
pledge created by the Resolution except to the extent expressly permitted thereby. The Issuer shall at all
times, to the extent permitted by law, defend, preserve and protect the pledge of the Revenues and other
moneys, securities, funds and other property pledged under the Resolution and all the rights of the
Bondholders under the Resolution against all claims and demands of all persons whomsoever. (Section
601)
Covenant as to Authority Revenues
So long as any Bonds are Outstanding, the Issuer shall cause the Authority to establish and
maintain group parking rates and charges at the Parking Facilities at levels adequate at all times, with

B-13

other available funds, to provide Revenues and other moneys, at least sufficient to pay or provide for, as
the same become due or are payable (i) all payments of Principal Installments and Redemption Price of
and interest on the Bonds and Subordinated Bonds, (ii) all amounts payable to the Debt Service Reserve
Fund, (iii) Issuer Administrative Expenses, if any, and (iv) all other amounts which the Issuer may by law
or contract be obligated to pay from Revenues. Provided the Issuer complies with provisions of the
Resolution described under the heading “Debt Service Fund” and has complied or is diligently proceeding
to comply with these covenants, the Trustee shall take no action pursuant to the Default provisions of the
Resolution on account of any failure by the Issuer to comply with this covenant.
The Issuer shall cause the Authority to establish and maintain group parking rates and charges at
the Parking Facilities at levels sufficient so that total Revenues, as of the end of each Fiscal Year during
which Bonds are Outstanding, shall equal at least 125% of the Maximum Annual Debt Service with
respect to all Bonds Outstanding as of such date; provided that such portion of Revenues derived from the
Parking Facilities and any earnings allocable thereto shall equal at least 110% of the Maximum Annual
Debt Service with respect to all Bonds Outstanding as of such date. Failure by the Issuer to comply with
these requirements o of the Resolution shall not be considered an Event of Default under the Resolution
so long as the Issuer has complied or is diligently proceeding to comply with these requirements.
The Issuer shall review the adequacy of the Authority’s group parking rates and charges for the
Parking Facilities at the end of each Fiscal Year to ensure that they satisfy the revenue covenants of the
Resolution for the next Fiscal Year. If such review indicates that Revenues are, or are likely to be,
insufficient to meet the requirements of the Resolution for the next Fiscal Year, or if it otherwise appears at
any time during such Fiscal Year that Revenues are or are likely to be insufficient to meet such
requirements, the Issuer shall promptly notify the Authority and cause the Authority to promptly engage the
services of a Parking Consultant. The Parking Consultant shall be instructed to review and analyze the
operations of the Parking Facilities and submit to the Issuer, the Authority and the Trustee, within 60 days
after such engagement, a written report containing the Parking Consultant’s recommendation of actions
designed to result in compliance with the requirements of the Resolution at the earliest practicable time.
Within 60 days of receiving such report, the Issuer shall take the actions or cause the Authority to take the
actions recommended in the report, provided that the Issuer or Authority may take such other actions as may
be agreed upon by the Issuer and the Authority if the Parking Consultant certifies in writing that such other
actions are in its opinion likely to result in compliance with the requirements of the Resolution’s revenue
covenants by a date no later than the date projected in its report in connection with its own
recommendations. So long as the Issuer and the Authority are following the recommendations of the
Parking Consultant and total Revenues for the preceding Fiscal Year are equal at least 110% of the
Maximum Annual Debt Service with respect to all Bonds Outstanding as of such date, failure to comply
with these revenue covenants shall not be an Event of Default. (Section 602)
Insurance
The Issuer shall at all times keep, or cause the Authority or the operators of the Parking Facilities
to keep, all property which is a part of the Parking Facilities and which is of an insurable nature and of the
character usually insured by owners or operators of parking facilities similar to the Parking Facilities
insured against loss or damage by fire and from other causes customarily insured against and in such
relative amounts as are customary, unless the Authority shall self insure against such risks. The Issuer
shall also at all times maintain, or cause the Authority or parking operators to maintain, insurance against
loss or damage from such hazards and risks to the persons and property of other as are usually insured
against by those operating parking facilities similar to the Parking Facilities, unless the Authority shall
self insure against such risks. In determining the amounts and types of insurance to be maintained, the
Issuer or Authority may rely upon the advice of an insurance consultant of recognized standing selected

B-14

by the Authority. Any policies of insurance shall be carried with insurers of good standing authorized to
do business in the Commonwealth. (Section 603)
Operation, Maintenance, and Reconstruction
The Issuer shall cause the Authority to operate the Parking Facilities properly, in a sound,
efficient and economical manner and shall maintain, preserve, and keep the same in functional working
order and condition, and make all necessary and proper repairs, replacements and renewals so that the
operation of the Parking Facilities may be properly conducted, and, expeditiously repair or replace any of
the Parking Facilities that is damaged or destroyed. (Section 604)
The Authority shall agree to be responsible for all operating expenses and capital and
maintenance costs related to the Parking Facilities to the same extent it was prior to the creation of the
Issuer and execution of the Transfer and Disposition Agreement. (Section 604)
Corporate Existence, Further Assurances
The Issuer shall at all times maintain its corporate or other separate legal existence and use its
best efforts to maintain, preserve and renew all the rights and powers provided to it by law. The Issuer
will not merge or consolidate with any other corporation, or other entity or sell or convey all or
substantially all of its assets to any person. The Issuer shall do and perform all acts and things required to
be done or performed by or on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the Resolution. At any and all times the
Issuer shall, so far as it may be authorized by law, pass, make, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all
and every such further resolutions, acts, deeds, conveyances, assignments, transfers and assurances as
may be necessary or desirable for better assuring, granting, pledging, assigning and confirming all and
singular of the rights, assets, revenues and other moneys, securities, funds and property thereby pledged
or assigned, or intended so to be, or which the Issuer may become bound to pledge or assign. (Section
605)
Creation of Liens; Other Indebtedness
The Issuer shall not issue any bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, other than the
Bonds and Subordinated Bonds, secured by a pledge of or other lien on the Revenues and other moneys,
securities, and funds held or set aside by the Issuer or by the Fiduciaries under the Resolution, and shall
not otherwise create or cause to be created any lien or charge on such Revenues, moneys, securities, and
funds held under the Resolution. (Section 606)
Tax Covenants
The Issuer shall take, or require to be taken, such action as may be reasonably within its ability
and required to assure the continued exclusion of interest on any Series of Tax Exempt Bonds from the
federal gross income of holders thereof, including, the preparation and filing of any statements required to
be filed by the Issuer in order to establish and maintain such exclusion. In addition, the Issuer shall not
take, or permit to be taken on its behalf, any action which would adversely affect the exclusion from
federal gross income of the interest on any Series of Tax Exempt Bonds. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Issuer shall not permit the investment or application of the proceeds of any Series of Tax Exempt
Bonds, including any funds considered proceeds within the meaning of Section 148 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to be used to acquire any investment property the acquisition of
which would cause such Tax Exempt Bonds to be “arbitrage bonds” within the meaning of said Section
148. (Section 607)

accountant or firm of accountants, relating to or including schedules relating to the Revenues for such
Fiscal Year and, beginning with the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2012, setting forth a summary of the

Year, the Issuer shall notify the Trustee within 180 days. Each annual report shall be accompanied by a
certificate of the President of the Issuer to the effect that the Issuer is in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of the Resolution or identifying any failure to comply and the actions of the Issuer
to remedy the same. (Section 608)
Transfer and Disposition Agreement
The Issuer will keep in full force and effect the Transfer and Disposition Agreement and diligently
enforce its rights thereunder and will not consent to any rescission or any amendment to or otherwise take
any action under or in connection with the Transfer and Disposition Agreement which will have a material
adverse effect upon the rights of the Holders of the Bonds. (Section 609)
Payment of Lawful Claims
The Issuer shall, pay all lawful claims and demands for labor, materials, supplies or other objects
from Trust Asset, but the Issuer is not required to pay for, any such lien or charge so long as the validity
thereof shall be contested in good faith and by appropriate legal proceedings. (Section 610)
Other Parking Facilities
The Issuer and the Authority will agree not to expand any existing parking facility or construct a
new parking facility, that services the same service area of the Authority as the Parking Facilities if, in the
opinion of the Issuer, such expansion or construction would adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to
comply with the revenue covenants of the Resolution. (Section 611)
Disposition of Parking Facilities
The Issuer and the Authority will agree not to dispose of all or a portion of the Parking Facilities
unless it can demonstrate that Revenues during twelve (12) successive months of the last twenty-four (24)
months immediately preceding the date of the proposed disposition, excluding Revenues generated from
such portion of the Parking Facilities to be disposed of, were at least equal to 1.50 Maximum Annual
Debt Service on all Outstanding Bonds. (Section 612)
Dedicated Payments
Revenues of the Issuer which are not Revenues as defined in the Resolution may be pledged and
designated as Dedicated Payments thereunder by resolution of the Issuer, If such Dedicated Payments are
to be received from the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, (a) they must
automatically recur without appropriation, approval or other similar action by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof for so long as the Authority is relying thereon for the
purpose of securing Bonds and (b) the manner of determining the amounts to be derived therefrom must
not be subject to change or revision during such period. If such Dedicated Payments are to be received

B-16

from the Commonwealth, they must consist of a payment obligation payable to the Issuer or the Authority
pursuant to a statutory or contractual arrangement with the Commonwealth which, in the opinion of Bond
Counsel, constitutes a general obligation of the Commonwealth, provided that at the time of entering into
such an arrangement (a) such arrangement, by its terms, will not terminate so long as the Issuer is relying
thereon for the purpose of securing Bonds and (b) the manner of determining the amounts to be derived
from such arrangement is not subject to change or revision during such period and, provided further, that
if such amounts are payable to the Authority pursuant to such statutory or contractual arrangement, the
Authority shall have pledged such amount to the Issuer. If such Dedicated Payments are to be received in
a manner not described above, the Issuer may designate any revenues which are not Revenues as
Dedicated Payments, provided that such revenues consist of obligations with a rating by each Rating
Agency in a category equal to or higher than its unenhanced, published rating on Outstanding Bonds. All
Dedicated Payments shall be deposited upon receipt in the Debt Service Fund. The Issuer may reverse or
modify any pledge and designation of Dedicated Payments by a further resolution, and any determination
to deposit Dedicated Payments in the Debt Service Fund may be reversed or modified by written direction
to the Trustee from an Authorized Officer, provided that such Authorized Officer shall certify to the
Trustee that following such reversal or modification the Authority will meet the test for incurring one
dollar of Additional Bonds under the Resolution. (Section 613)
Defaults and Remedies:

Issuer and the Trustee by the Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the
Bonds Outstanding; provided that if such default cannot be remedied within such
30 day period, it shall not constitute an Event of Default hereunder if corrective
action is instituted by the Issuer within such period and diligently pursued until
the default is remedied,

(v)

if an order, judgment or decree is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction (a)
appointing a receiver, trustee, or liquidator for the Issuer, (b) granting relief in

the Trustee, shall pay over and assign to the Trustee (i) all moneys, securities, Additional Security, if any,

proper charges and expenses of the Fiduciaries including without limitation the fees and disbursements of
its legal counsel, and all other sums payable by the Issuer under the Resolution, shall either be paid by or
for the account of the Issuer, or provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall be made for such payment and

Issuer all moneys, securities and funds remaining unexpended in all funds and accounts provided by the
Resolution to be held by the Issuer, the Issuer and the Trustee shall then be restored, to their former
positions and rights under the Resolution and all Revenues shall thereafter be applied as provided in the
Resolution.
The proceeds of any Additional Security shall be applied by the Trustee in the manner provided
in the applicable Supplemental Resolution authorizing such Additional Security. (Section 702)
Proceedings Brought by Trustee
If an Event of Default shall happen and shall not have been remedied, then the Trustee may
proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of the Bonds under the Resolution
by a suit in equity or at law, whether for the specific performance of any covenant, or in aid of the
execution of any power therein granted, or for an accounting against the Issuer as if the Issuer were the
trustee of an express trust, or in the enforcement of any other legal or equitable right as the Trustee, being
advised by counsel, shall deem most effectual to enforce any of its rights or to perform any of its duties
under the Resolution. The Trustee may enforce all rights of action under the Resolution without the
possession of any of the Bonds.
The Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the Bonds Outstanding may direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, but the Trustee
shall have the right to decline any such direction if the Trustee shall be advised by counsel that the action
or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken, or if the Trustee in shall determine that the action or
proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or be unjustly prejudicial to the
Bondholders not parties to such direction.
Regardless of the happening of an Event of Default, the Trustee shall have power to, but unless
requested by the Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the Bonds then Outstanding and furnished
with satisfactory security and indemnity, shall be under no obligation to, institute and maintain such suits and
proceedings as it may deem necessary or expedient to prevent any impairment of the security under the
Resolution by any acts which may be unlawful or in violation of the Resolution, or necessary or expedient to
preserve or protect its interests and the interests of the Bondholders. (Section 703)
Restriction on Bondholders’ Action
No Holder of any Bond shall have any right to institute any suit, action or proceeding at law or in
equity for the enforcement of any provision of the Resolution or for any remedy under the Resolution,
unless such Holder has given to the Trustee written notice of the happening of any Event of Default and
filed a written request with the Trustee, and offered it reasonable opportunity to exercise the powers
granted by the Resolution in its own name, and unless such Holders offered the Trustee adequate security
and indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in connection therewith, and the
Trustee shall have refused to comply within a reasonable time.
Nothing in the Resolution shall affect or impair the obligation of the Issuer to pay on the
respective dates of maturity thereof the Principal Amount of and interest on the Bonds, or affect or impair
the right of action of any Holder to enforce the payment of his Bond. (Section 704)

B-19

Remedies Not Exclusive

Bondholders is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, but each and every such remedy shall be
cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given under the Resolution or provided at law
or in equity or by statute. (Section 705)
Effect of Waiver and Other Circumstances
No delay or omission of the Trustee or any Bondholder to exercise any right or power arising
upon an Event of Default shall impair any right or power nor shall be construed as a waiver of the default
or to be an acquiescence therein.
The Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding may on
behalf of the Holders of all of the Bonds waive any past default under the Resolution and its
consequences, except a default in the payment of interest or Principal Installments or Redemption Price of
any of the Bonds. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default. (Section 706)

Paying Agents

for the Bonds of any Series in the applicable Supplemental Resolution. A Paying Agent may resign
upon 30 days’ notice to the Issuer and the Trustee. The Paying Agent may be removed at any time by the
Issuer by notice delivered to the Trustee, each Bondholder and the Paying Agent. Upon resignation or
removal of the Paying Agent, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Paying Agent. The Issuer shall notify
each Bondholder of the related Series of Bonds of the appointment of such successor. Upon the
resignation or removal of the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall pay over, assign and deliver any
moneys and Bonds held by it in trust pursuant to the Resolution to its successor. (Section 802)
Depositories
The Issuer may appoint one or more Depositories to hold, as an agent for the Trustee, moneys to
be held under the provisions of this Resolution. Such Depository shall agree to provide monthly reports
to the Trustee as to the balances on deposit in the fund or funds held by such Depository and shall
acknowledge in writing that the moneys held by it are being held by it as agent for the Trustee and subject
to the provisions of the Resolution. (Section 803)
Responsibility of Fiduciaries
No Fiduciary assumes any responsibility for the correctness of the recitals of fact in the
Resolution and in the Bonds. The duties and obligations of the Fiduciaries shall be determined by the
express provisions of the Resolution and the Fiduciaries shall not be liable except for their performance of
such duties and obligations as specifically set forth therein. No Fiduciary shall incur any responsibility as
to the validity or sufficiency of the Resolution or of any Bonds issued thereunder or in respect of the
security afforded by the Resolution. The Authenticating Agent for any Bonds shall be responsible for its
representation contained in its certificate of authentication on the Bonds only to the extent provided in
Article 8, section 208, as amended, of the Massachusetts Uniform Commercial Code. No Fiduciary shall
be under any responsibility or duty with respect to the issuance of the Bonds for value or the application
of the proceeds thereof or the application of any moneys paid to the Issuer or any other Fiduciary. No

B-20

Fiduciary shall be under any obligation or duty to perform any act which would involve it in expense or
liability or to institute or defend any suit in respect hereof, or to advance any of its own moneys, unless
properly indemnified. No Fiduciary shall be liable in connection with the performance of its duties
thereunder except for its own negligence or default nor shall any Fiduciary be liable for any action taken
or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or
powers conferred upon it by the Resolution.
All moneys held by any Fiduciary at any time pursuant to the terms of the Resolution shall be and
hereby are assigned, transferred and set over unto such Fiduciary in trust for the purposes and under the
terms and conditions of the Resolution. (Section 804)
Permitted Acts
Any Fiduciary may become the owner of any Bonds and may otherwise deal with the Issuer, with
the same rights it would have if it were not a Fiduciary. To the extent permitted by law, any Fiduciary
may act as depository for, and permit any of its officers or directors to act as a member of, or in any other
capacity with respect to, any committee formed to protect the rights of Bondholders or to effect or aid in
any reorganization growing out of the enforcement of the Bonds or the Resolution, whether or not any
such committee shall represent the Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the Bonds Outstanding.
(Section 807)
Resignation of Trustee
The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged of the duties and obligations created by the
Resolution by giving 60 days’ notice to the Issuer and 30 days’ notice to each Bondholder and Paying
Agent specifying the date when such resignation shall take effect. (Section 808)
Removal of Trustee
The Trustee may be removed at any time by the Issuer by written notice delivered to the Trustee,
each Bondholder and the Paying Agent or an instrument or concurrent instruments in writing, filed with
the Trustee, and signed by the Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the Bonds then Outstanding
or their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, excluding any Bonds held by or for the account of the Issuer.
(Section 809)
Appointment of Successor Trustee
If the Trustee shall resign or be removed or become incapable of acting, or be adjudged a
bankrupt or insolvent, or if a receiver, liquidator or conservator of the Trustee is appointed, or if any
public officer takes control of the Trustee, its property, or affairs, a successor may be appointed by the
Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the Bonds then Outstanding, excluding any Bonds held by
or for the account of the Issuer, by an instrument or concurrent instruments in writing signed and
acknowledged by such Bondholders or by their attorneys-in-fact and delivered to such successor Trustee,
notification being given to the Issuer and the predecessor Trustee. Pending such appointment, the Issuer
by a written instrument delivered to the predecessor Trustee shall appoint a Trustee to fill the vacancy
until a successor Trustee is appointed by the Bondholders as authorized by the Resolution. The Issuer
shall give written notice of any such appointment made by it to each Bondholder and Paying Agent at
least 30 days after the date of such appointment. Any successor Trustee appointed by the Issuer shall,
immediately and without further act, be superseded by a Trustee appointed by the Bondholders. If in a
proper case no appointment of a successor Trustee shall be made within 45 days after the Trustee shall
have given to the Issuer written notice as provided in the Resolution or after the occurrence of any other
event requiring or authorizing such appointment, the Trustee or the Holder of any Bond may apply to any

B-21

court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor Trustee. The Trustee shall continue to serve until a
successor Trustee is appointed. (Section 810)

a party or any company to which any Fiduciary may sell or transfer all or substantially all of its corporate
trust business provided such company shall be a bank or trust company or national banking association
which is qualified to be a successor to such Fiduciary under the Resolution and shall be authorized by law
to perform all the duties imposed upon it by the Resolution, shall be the successor to such Fiduciary
without the execution or filing of any paper or the performance of any further act, anything therein to the
contrary notwithstanding. (Section 812)

B-23

modification or amendment will, not take effect so long as any Bonds of any specified Series or maturity

Bonds shall not be deemed to be Outstanding for the purpose of the above calculation of Outstanding
Bonds; and provided, further, that no amendment shall permit a change in the terms of redemption or

Notation on Bonds
Bonds authenticated and delivered after the effective date of any Amendments made pursuant to
the Resolution may, and, if the Trustee so determines, shall, bear a notation in form approved by the
Issuer and the Trustee as to such action, and in that case upon demand of the Holder of any Bond
Outstanding at or after such effective date and presentation of his Bond for the purpose to the Trustee,
suitable notation shall be made on such Bond by the Trustee as to any such action. If the Issuer or the
Trustee shall so determine, new Bonds modified to conform to such action shall be prepared,
authenticated and delivered, and upon demand of the Holder of any Bond then outstanding shall be
exchanged, without cost to such Bondholder, for Bonds of the same Series and maturity then Outstanding,
upon surrender of such Bonds.(Section 1006)
Defeasance:
If the Issuer shall pay or cause to be paid, or there shall otherwise be paid, to the Holders of the
Bonds then Outstanding, the Principal Amount and interest and Redemption Price, if any, to become due
thereon, at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and in the Resolution then the pledge of any
Revenues or other moneys, securities and Additional Security, if any, pledged by the Resolution and all
other rights granted by the Resolution shall be discharged and satisfied. In such event, the Trustee shall,
upon request of the Issuer, execute and deliver to the Issuer all such instruments as may be desirable to
evidence such release and discharge and the Fiduciaries shall pay over or deliver to the Issuer all moneys
or securities held by them pursuant to the Resolution which are not required for the payment or
redemption of Bonds not theretofore surrendered for such payment for redemption.
Bonds or interest installments for the payment or redemption of which moneys shall be held by
the Fiduciaries, whether at or prior to the maturity or the redemption date of such Bonds, shall be deemed
to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in the prior paragraph. All
Outstanding Bonds of any Series or any part of a Series shall prior to the maturity or redemption date
thereof be deemed to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in the prior
paragraph if (i) in case any of said Bonds are to be redeemed on any date prior to their maturity, the Issuer
shall have given to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to it, irrevocable instructions to provide as provided
in the Resolution notice of redemption on said date of such Bonds, (ii) there shall have been deposited
with the Trustee either moneys in an amount which shall be sufficient, or Permitted Investments of the
type described in clause (i) of the definition thereof or Advance-Refunded Municipal Bonds not subject to
redemption at the option of the issuer thereof prior to the due date thereof, the principal of and interest on
which when due will provide moneys which, together with the moneys, if any, deposited with the Trustee
at the time of deposit of such Permitted Investments, shall be sufficient to pay when due the Principal
Amount or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due and to become due on said Bonds on and
prior to the redemption date or maturity date thereof, as the case may be, and (iii) in the event said Bonds
are not by their terms subject to redemption within the next succeeding 60 days, the Issuer shall have
given the Trustee in form satisfactory to it irrevocable instructions to provide, as soon as practicable, at
least 30 days written notice to the Holders of such Bonds that the deposit required above has been made
with the Trustee and that said Bonds are deemed to have been paid in accordance with the Resolution and
stating the maturity or redemption date upon which moneys are to be available for the payment of the
Principal Amount or Redemption Price, if applicable, on said Bonds. Neither Permitted Investments nor
moneys deposited with the Trustee pursuant to the Resolution nor principal or interest payments on any
such Permitted Investments shall be withdrawn or used for any purpose other than, and shall be held in
trust for, the payment of the Principal Amount or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest on said
Bonds; provided that any cash received from the principal or interest payments on such Permitted
Investments deposited with the Trustee, if not then needed for such purpose, may, to the extent
practicable, be reinvested in Permitted Investments maturing at times and in principal amounts sufficient

B-25

to pay when due the Principal Amount or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest to become due on
said Bonds on and prior to such redemption date or maturity date thereof. After the making of the
payments for which such Permitted Investments or moneys were held, any surplus shall be promptly paid
over to the Issuer free and clear of any trust, lien or pledge or assignment securing the Bonds or otherwise
existing under the Resolution.
Anything in the Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding, any moneys held by a Fiduciary in
trust for the payment and discharge of any Bonds which remain unclaimed for six years after the date
when such Bonds have become due and payable, either at their stated maturity dates or by call for earlier
redemption, shall, at the request of the Issuer, be repaid promptly by the Fiduciary to the Issuer, as its
absolute property and free from trust, and the Fiduciary shall thereupon be released and discharged with
respect thereto and the Bondholders shall look only to the Issuer for the payment of such Bonds;
provided, that before being required to make any such payment to the Issuer, the Fiduciary shall, at the

Form of
SYSTEMWIDE PARKING REVENUE TRANSFER AND DISPOSITION AGREEMENT
This SYSTEMWIDE PARKING REVENUE TRANSFER AND DISPOSITION AGREEMENT,
dated as of June 1, 2011, is between the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, a body politic and
corporate and political subdivision of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts established under Chapter
161A of the Massachusetts General Laws (the “Authority”), and Metropolitan Boston Transit Parking
Corporation, a Massachusetts nonprofit corporation and agency and instrumentality of the Authority, and
its permitted successors and assigns (the “Issuer”).
W I T N E S S E T H:
WHEREAS, the Authority has determined to refinance outstanding indebtedness through the
issuance of debt obligations secured primarily by the revenues generated from certain group parking
facilities listed on Exhibit A hereto (as may be amended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
the “Parking Facilities”), each of which is owned or operated by or on behalf of the Authority; and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has been created, as an agency and instrumentality of the Authority, for
the special purpose of accomplishing such a financing, and the Authority has approved the establishment
of the Issuer, the issuance of such debt obligations by the Issuer and the transfer of revenues generated by
the Parking Facilities to the Issuer; and
WHEREAS, the Authority will continue to own and operate the group parking facilities subject to
the financing and be responsible, at the Authority’s sole expense, for the operation and maintenance
thereof to the same extent it has been prior to the creation of the Issuer and execution of this Agreement;
and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has adopted its Metropolitan Boston Transit Parking Corporation
Systemwide Parking Revenue Bond Resolution (as amended and supplemented, the “Bond Resolution”)
to provide for the issuance of debt obligations secured primarily by the revenues of such group parking
facilities as aforesaid; and
WHEREAS, in order for the Issuer to market such debt obligations, the Issuer requires certain
covenants and agreements on the part of the Authority as described herein; and
WHEREAS, in order for the Authority to effectuate the refinancing as aforesaid, the Authority
requires certain covenants and agreements on the part of the Issuer as described herein;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual agreements herein
contained, the Authority and the Issuer hereby agree as follows:
SECTION 1. Definitions. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, terms used in this
Agreement shall be used as defined in the Bond Resolution.
SECTION 2. Rates and Charges for Parking Facilities. The Authority represents that it is duly
authorized under all applicable laws to establish, collect and pledge the rates and charges at the Parking
Facilities and transfer the Revenues in the manner and to the extent provided in the Bond Resolution.

C-1

The Authority agrees to establish and maintain parking rates and charges at the Parking Facilities
at levels adequate at all times, with other funds available to the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement or the
Bond Resolution, to provide Revenues and other moneys to meet the requirements of Section 602(1) and
(2) of the Bond Resolution.
On or before February 1 of each year, commencing February 1, 2012, the Issuer shall provide to
the Authority a schedule of debt service coming due on any Outstanding Bonds issued pursuant to the
Bond Resolution, balances in the Debt Service Fund, if any, available to pay debt service during the next
succeeding Fiscal Year and other information reasonably requested by the Authority.
On or before June 30, 2011 and April 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2012, the Authority
shall provide to the Issuer estimated Revenues for the following Fiscal Year and such other information
reasonably requested by the Issuer. If such Revenues are, or are likely to be, insufficient to meet the
requirements of Section 602(1) and (2) of the Bond Resolution for the next succeeding Fiscal Year, or if it
otherwise appears at any time during such Fiscal Year that Revenues are or are likely to be insufficient to
meet such requirements, the Authority agrees to engage, and follow the recommendations of, a Parking
Consultant, in accordance with and subject to the terms of Section 602(3) of the Bond Resolution.
SECTION 3. Operation and Maintenance of Parking Facilities. The Authority agrees to operate
the Parking Facilities, or cause such facilities to be operated pursuant to management agreements,
properly and in a sound, efficient and economical manner and shall maintain, preserve, and keep the same
or cause the same to be maintained, preserved, and kept in functional working order and condition, and
shall from time to time make, or cause to be made, all necessary and proper repairs, replacements and
renewals so that the operation of the Parking Facilities may be properly conducted. If any useful part of
the Parking Facilities is damaged or destroyed, the Authority agrees, as expeditiously as practicable, to
commence and diligently prosecute the replacement or reconstruction of such damaged or destroyed part
so as to restore the same to use. The Authority agrees that it is, and will remain, responsible for all
operating expenses and capital and maintenance costs related to the Parking Facilities to the same extent
as it was prior to the creation of the Issuer and execution of this Agreement.
SECTION 4. Maintenance and Enforcement of Management Agreements. The Authority agrees
to maintain, perform its obligations and enforce its rights under any agreement entered into with respect
to the management of all or a portion of the Parking Facilities (each, a “Management Agreement” and
collectively, the “Management Agreement”) and shall not agree to any amendment of any Management
Agreement that would materially adversely affect the rights of the Issuer, the Trustee or the holders of any
Bonds. The list of Management Agreements in effect with respect to Parking Facilities at the time of
initial execution of this Agreement is included as Exhibit B. Upon the execution of any new Management
Agreement, the Authority agrees to provide a copy thereof to the Issuer and the Trustee, along with an
update copy of Exhibit B. The Authority agrees to use its best efforts to ensure that any Management
Agreement does not adversely affect the exclusion from federal gross income of the interest on any
Bonds.
SECTION 5. Deposit of Revenues; No Creation of Liens. The Authority assigns and shall pay
over or cause to be paid over to the Trustee for deposit in the Revenue Fund in accordance with Section
503 of the Bond Resolution all Revenues it receives, including without limitation, all Gross Revenues (as
defined in the Management Agreements) deposited by managers of the Parking Facilities under the
Management Agreements. The Authority agrees not to create or cause to be created any lien or charge on
such Revenues, other than in accordance with the Bond Resolution.
In accordance with the Bond Resolution, following the monthly application of the Revenues as
set forth therein, the balance of such Revenues shall be transferred to the Authority.

C-2

SECTION 6. Financial Statements. The Authority shall provide to the Issuer annually, not later
than 170 days after the close of each Fiscal Year beginning with the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2011 or
as soon thereafter as is practicable, a copy of financial statements of the Authority, audited by and
containing the report of an independent public accountant or firm of accountants, beginning with the
Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2012, including information about the Corporation, the Revenues, the Bonds
and the Debt Service Reserve Fund during such Fiscal Year. In the event that such financial statements
are not available within 170 days after the close of each Fiscal Year, the Authority shall so notify the
Issuer Trustee in writing within 170 days.
SECTION 7. Payment of Lawful Claims. The Authority agrees to pay or cause to be discharged,
or make adequate provision to satisfy and discharge, all lawful claims and demands for labor, materials,
supplies or other objects which, if unpaid, might by law become a lien upon the Trust Assets, provided,
however, that nothing herein contained shall require the Authority to pay or cause to be discharged, or
make provision for, any such lien or charge so long as the validity thereof shall be contested in good faith
and by appropriate legal proceedings.
SECTION 8. No Competition with Parking Facilities. The Authority agrees not to expand any
existing parking facility or construct a new parking facility, either of which is not then a Parking Facility,
that services the same service area of the Authority as the Parking Facilities if, in the opinion of the
Issuer, such expansion or construction would adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to comply with
Section 602(1) or (2).
SECTION 9. Disposition or Addition of Parking Facilities. The Authority agrees not to dispose
of all or a portion of the Parking Facilities unless it can demonstrate, in a certificate of an Authorized
Officer, that Revenues during twelve (12) successive months of the last twenty-four (24) months
immediately preceding the date of the proposed disposition, excluding Revenues generated from such
portion of the Parking Facilities to be disposed of, were at least equal to 1.50 Maximum Annual Debt
Service on all Outstanding Bonds. The Authority shall notify the Issuer of any Disposition in accordance
with the terms of this Section 9 and provide an updated Exhibit A to the Issuer and the Trustee.
The Authority may, at any time, add additional group parking facilities or other parking facilities
to the Parking Facilities by filing an amended copy of Exhibit A with the Issuer and the Trustee.
SECTION 10. Insurance. The Authority agrees to maintain insurance for or self insure the
Parking Facilities as set forth in Section 603 of the Bond Resolution.
SECTION 11. Tax Covenants The Authority agrees to take such action as may be reasonably
within its ability and required to assure the continued exclusion of interest on any Bonds from the federal
gross income of holders thereof, including, without limitation, the preparation and filing of any statements
requested and required to be filed by the Issuer in order to establish and maintain such exclusion. In
addition, the Authority agrees not to take, or permit to be taken on its behalf, any action which would
adversely affect the exclusion from federal gross income of the interest on any Bonds.
SECTION 12. Partial Invalidity. If any term, covenant or condition of this Agreement shall be
invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby, and each term,
covenant and condition of this Agreement shall be valid and shall be enforced to the extent permitted by
law.
SECTION 13. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
C-3

SECTION 14. No Personal Liability. No recourse shall be had by either party for any claim
against any officer, director, stockholder, employee or agent of any other party alleging personal liability
on the part of such person with respect to the performance of the Authority’s or the Issuer’s obligations
under this Agreement.
SECTION 15. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate upon the payment in full or
defeasance of all of the Outstanding Bonds in accordance with Article XI of the Bond Resolution.
SECTION 16. No Waiver. No failure or delay on the part of either of the parties hereto in
exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any other right or remedy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly
authorized officers as of the day and date first above written.

Re:

$304,585,000 Metropolitan Boston Transit Parking Corporation Systemwide Senior Lien
Parking Revenue Bonds, Series 2011

We have acted as bond counsel to Metropolitan Boston Transit Parking Corporation (the “Issuer”)
in connection with the issuance by the Issuer of its Systemwide Senior Lien Parking Revenue Bonds, Series
2011 (the “Bonds”) pursuant to the Systemwide Senior Lien Revenue Bond Resolution of the Issuer adopted
May 27, 2011 and a First Supplemental Bond Resolution of the Issuer adopted as of May 27, 2011
(collectively, the “Resolution”).
In such capacity, we have examined such law and such certified proceedings and other documents
as we have deemed necessary to render this opinion, including without limitation the Systemwide Parking
Revenue Transfer and Disposition Agreement dated as of June 1, 2011 (the “Transfer and Disposition
Agreement”) between the Issuer and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (the “Authority”).
Capitalized terms used herein shall, unless otherwise specified, have the meanings set forth in the
Resolution.
Under the Resolution, the Issuer has pledged certain revenues, funds and contract rights for the
payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds when due.
As to questions of fact material to our opinion, we have relied upon the representations of the Issuer
and the Authority contained in the Resolution and the Transfer and Disposition Agreement and in the
certified proceedings and other certifications furnished to us without undertaking to verify the same by
independent investigation.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, under existing law:
1. The Issuer is validly existing as a Massachusetts nonprofit corporation and is an agency and
instrumentality of the Authority, with the power to adopt the Resolution, perform the agreements on its
part contained therein and issue the Bonds.

D-1

2. The Transfer and Disposition Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer
and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Issuer enforceable upon the Issuer. The Transfer
and Disposition Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Authority and
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Authority enforceable upon the Authority.
3. The Resolution has been duly adopted by the Issuer and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Issuer enforceable upon the Issuer.
4. The Resolution creates a valid lien on the revenues, funds and contract rights pledged by the Resolution
for the security of the Bonds on a parity with other bonds, if any, to be issued under the Resolution.
5. The Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer and are valid and binding
obligations of the Issuer, payable solely from the sources provided therefor in the Resolution. Neither
the Authority nor the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is obligated to pay the principal of or
redemption premium, if any, or interest on the Bonds, and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing
power of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or of any political subdivision thereof, including without
limitation the Authority, is pledged to the payment of the principal of or redemption premium, if any, or
interest on the Bonds.
6. (a) Under existing law, interest on the Bonds will not be included in the gross income of holders of the
Bonds for federal income tax purposes. This opinion is expressly conditioned upon compliance with
certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which
requirements must be satisfied after the date of issuance of the Bonds in order to ensure that the interest
on the Bonds is and continues to be excludable from the gross income of the holders the Bonds. Failure
so to comply could cause the interest on the Bonds to be included in the gross income of the holders
thereof, retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds.
(b) While interest on the Bonds is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the alternative
minimum tax imposed under federal tax law on individuals and corporations, interest on the Bonds will
be included in the “adjusted current earnings” of corporate holders of the Bonds and therefore will be
taken into account in computing the alternative minimum tax imposed on certain corporations.
(c) We express no opinion regarding other federal tax consequences of holding the Bonds.
7. Interest on the Bonds is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the Bonds are exempt
from Massachusetts personal property taxes. We express no opinion as to other Massachusetts tax
consequences arising with respect to the Bonds or as to the taxability of the Bonds or the income
therefrom under the laws of any state other than Massachusetts.
8. For federal and Massachusetts tax purposes, interest includes original issue discount allocable to the
holder of a Bond. Original issue discount with respect to the Bonds is equal to the excess, if any, of the
stated redemption price at maturity of such Bonds over the initial offering price thereof to the public,
excluding underwriters and other intermediaries, at which price a substantial amount of all Bonds with
the same maturity were sold. Original issue discount accrues actuarially over the term of the Bonds.
Holders should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the computation of original issue discount
on such accruals of interest during the period in which any such Bond is held.

It is to be understood that the rights of the holders of the Bonds and the enforceability of the Bonds,
the Resolution and the Transfer and Disposition Agreement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and by equitable
principles, whether considered at law or in equity.
This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to revise or supplement
this opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances that may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in
law that may hereafter occur.
Very truly yours,

(the “Bonds”)
Continuing Disclosure Undertaking
Prior to the issuance of the Bonds, the Metropolitan Boston Transit Parking Corporation (the
“Corporation”), the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (“MBTA”) and the Trustee will enter into
a continuing disclosure agreement (the “Disclosure Agreement”) setting forth the undertakings of the
Corporation and the MBTA regarding continuing disclosure with respect to the Bonds. In the Disclosure
Agreement, the Corporation will undertake for the benefit of the registered owners and Beneficial Owners
(the “owners”) of the Bonds to provide to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) through
its Electronic Municipal Market Access (“EMMA”) system pursuant to Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “Rule”), within the meaning of the Rule, not later than December 31 of each
year, (i) the annual financial information described below relating to such fiscal year, together with audited
financial statements of the MBTA for such fiscal year if audited financial statements are then available,
provided, however, that if audited financial statements of the MBTA are not then available, such audited
financial statements shall be delivered to EMMA when they become available or (ii) notice of the
Corporation's failure, if any, to provide any such information. The annual financial information to be
provided as aforesaid shall include financial information and operating data, in each case updated through
the last day of such fiscal year unless otherwise noted, relating to the list of Parking Facilities, rates and
charges for the Parking Facilities and gross revenues from the Parking Facilities, in each case to the extent
not included in the MBTA’s audited financial statements and substantially in the same level of detail as is
found in this Official Statement.
Any or all of the items listed above may be included by reference to other documents, including
official statements pertaining to debt issued by the Corporation, which have been submitted to EMMA. If
the document incorporated by reference is a Final Official Statement within the meaning of the Rule, it will
also be available from the MSRB. The MBTA's annual financial statements for each fiscal year shall consist
of the balance sheet (statement of net assets) of the MBTA and the related statements of revenue, expenses
and changes in net assets and statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in effect from time to time. Such financial statements shall be audited by a firm of
certified public accountants appointed by the MBTA.
In the Disclosure Agreement, the Corporation also will undertake for the benefit of the owners of
the Bonds to provide to EMMA in a timely manner, not in excess of ten business days after the occurrence
of the event, notice of any of the following events with respect to the Bonds:
(i)

principal and interest payment delinquencies;

(ii)

non-payment related defaults, if material;

(iii)

unscheduled draws on debt service reserves reflecting financial difficulties;

(iv)

unscheduled draws on credit enhancements reflecting financial difficulties;

(v)

substitution of credit or liquidity providers, or their failure to perform;
E-1

(vi)

adverse tax opinions, the issuance by the Internal Revenue Service of proposed or final
determinations of taxability, Notices of Proposed Issue (IRS Form 5701-TEB) or other
material notices or determinations with respect to the tax status of the security, or other
material events affecting the tax status of the security;

(vii)

modifications to rights of security holders, if material;

(viii)

bonds calls, if material, and tender offers;

(ix)

defeasances;

(x)

release, substitution or sale of property securing repayment of the securities, if material;

(xi)

rating changes;

(xii)

bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar event of the obligated person;

(xiii)

the consummation of a merger, consolidation, or acquisition involving an obligated person
or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the obligated person, other than in the
ordinary course of business, the entry into a definitive agreement to undertake such an
action or the termination of a definitive agreement relating to any such actions, other than
pursuant to its terms, if material; and

(xiv)

appointment of a successor or additional trustee or the change of name of a
trustee, if material.

Nothing in the Disclosure Agreement shall preclude the Corporation or the MBTA from
disseminating any information in addition to that required under the Disclosure Agreement. If the
Corporation or the MBTA disseminates any such additional information, nothing in the Disclosure
Agreement shall obligate the Corporation or the MBTA to update such information or include it in any
future materials disseminated.
To the extent permitted by law, the provisions of the Disclosure Agreement shall be enforceable
against the Corporation in accordance with the terms thereof by any owner of a Bond, including any
beneficial owner acting as a third-party beneficiary (upon proof of its status as a beneficial owner reasonably
satisfactory to the Corporation). To the extent permitted by law, any such owner shall have the right, for the
equal benefit and protection of all owners of the Bonds, by mandamus or other suit or proceeding at law or
in equity, to enforce its rights against the Corporation and to compel the Corporation and any of its officers,
agents or employees to perform and carry out their duties under the foregoing provisions as aforesaid,
provided, however, that the sole remedy in connection with such undertakings shall be limited to an action
to compel specific performance of the obligations of the Corporation in connection with such undertakings
and shall not include any rights to monetary damages. The Corporation's obligations in respect of the
Disclosure Agreement shall terminate if no Bonds remain outstanding (without regard to an economic
defeasance) or if the provisions of the Rule concerning continuing disclosure are no longer effective,
whichever occurs first. The provisions of the Disclosure Agreement may be amended by the Corporation
and the Trustee, without the consent of, or notice to, any owners of the Bonds, (a) to comply with or
conform to the provisions of the Rule or any amendments thereto or authoritative interpretations thereof by
the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff (whether required or optional), (b) to add a
dissemination agent for the information required to be provided by such undertakings and to make any
necessary or desirable provisions with respect thereto, (c) to add to the covenants of the Corporation for the
E-2

benefit of the owners of the Bonds, (d) to modify the contents, presentation and format of the annual
financial information from time to time as a result of a change in circumstances that arises from a change in
legal requirements, or (e) to otherwise modify the undertakings in a manner responding to the requirements
of the Rule concerning continuing disclosure; provided, however, that in the case of any amendment
pursuant to clause (d) or (e), (i) the undertaking, as amended, would have complied with the requirements of
the Rule at the time of the offering of the Bonds, after taking into account any amendments or authoritative
interpretations of the Rule, as well as any change in circumstances, and (ii) the amendment does not
materially impair the interests of the owners of the Bonds, as determined either by a party unaffiliated with
the Corporation (such as Corporation bond counsel) or by the vote or consent of owners of a majority in
outstanding principal amount of the Bonds affected thereby at or prior to the time of such amendment.

APPENDIX F
Book-Entry Only System
DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds. The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered
securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may
be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Bond certificate will be issued
for each maturity of the Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be
deposited with DTC.
General. DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company
organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New
York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the
meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the
provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset
servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt
issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct
Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants
of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized bookentry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical
movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the
holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated
subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S.
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect
Participants”). DTC has Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group highest rating: AAA. The DTC Rules
applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information
about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com and www.dtc.org.
Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants,
which will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual
purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect
Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their
purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of
the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant
through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the
Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on
behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership
interests in Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.
Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not
receive certificates representing their ownership interest in the Bonds except in the event that use of the
book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.
To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are
registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be
requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Bonds with DTC and their registration
in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership.
F-1

DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the
identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be
the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account
of their holdings on behalf of their customers.
Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct
Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial
Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory
requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to take certain
steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Bonds, such
as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Bond documents. For example,
Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Bonds for their benefit
has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may
wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of notices be provided
directly to them.
Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within a single maturity of a
series of Bonds are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each
Direct Participant in such maturity to be redeemed.
Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to
Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI Procedures. Under its
usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Issuer as soon as possible after the record date.
The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to
whose accounts Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus
Proxy).
Redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments on the Bonds will be made to Cede &
Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice
is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail
information from the Issuer or Trustee, on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings
shown on DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing
instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in
bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of
DTC, the Trustee, or the Corporation, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in
effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede
& Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the
responsibility of the Corporation or the Trustee, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will
be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the
responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.
The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry only system has been
obtained from sources that the Corporation believes to be reliable, but neither the Corporation nor
the Underwriters takes responsibility for the accuracy thereof.
No Responsibility of Corporation and Trustee. Neither the Corporation nor the Trustee will
have any responsibility or obligations to direct participants or the persons for whom they act as
nominees with respect to the payments to or the providing of notice for direct participants, indirect
participants, or beneficial owners.

So long as Cede & Co. is the Registered Owner of the Bonds, as nominee of DTC,
references herein to the Bondowners or Registered Owners of the Bonds shall mean Cede & Co.
and shall not mean the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds.
Certificated Bonds. DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the
Bonds at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Corporation or the Trustee. In addition, the
Corporation may determine that continuation of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a
successor securities depository) is not in the best interests of the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds. If for
either reason the Book-Entry Only System is discontinued, Bond certificates will be delivered as described
in the Bond Resolution and the Beneficial Owner, upon registration of certificates held in the Beneficial
Owner’s name, will become the Bondowner. Thereafter, the Bonds may be exchanged for an equal
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds in other authorized denominations and of the same maturity, upon
surrender thereof at the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee. The transfer of any Bond may be
registered on the books maintained by the Trustee for such purpose only upon assignment in form
satisfactory to the Trustee. For every exchange or registration of transfer of the Bonds, the Corporation and
the Trustee may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to such exchange or registration of transfer, but no other charge may be
made to the Bondowner for any exchange or registration of transfer of the Bonds. The Trustee will not be
required to transfer or exchange any Bond during the notice period preceding any redemption if such Bond
(or any part thereof) is eligible to be selected or has been selected for redemption.
