In the opinion of Locke Lord LLP, Bond Counsel, based upon an analysis of existing law and assuming, among other matters, compliance
with certain covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986. Interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes,
although such interest is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable income. Under
existing law, interest on the Bonds is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts
personal property taxes. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of,
or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds. See “Tax Exemption” herein.

OFFICIAL STATEMENT
of the
CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
relating to
$58,370,000
GENERAL OBLIGATION REFUNDING BONDS, 2017 SERIES B

This Official Statement (which includes the cover page and Appendices hereto) provides information
concerning the City of Boston, Massachusetts (the “City”), and the $58,370,000 General Obligation Refunding
Bonds, 2017 Series B (the “Bonds”), to be issued by the City as described herein. Certain credit factors concerning
the Bonds are described throughout this Official Statement, which should be read in its entirety. This Official
Statement speaks only as of its date and the information contained herein is subject to change after this date.
THE CITY
The City of Boston, incorporated as a town in 1630 and as a city in 1822, is the largest city in Massachusetts
and the capital of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Commonwealth”). The City and its component
governmental units are responsible for the provision of a wide range of government services, including education,
public safety, public health, urban planning and development and the maintenance of the City’s infrastructure, and
for funding certain employee benefits, state authority assessments and debt service requirements. Its primary sources
of revenue are property taxes, state aid and certain excises. Management of the City’s finances includes preparation
of annual operating and capital budgets, the exercise of expenditure controls and cash management. For a full
discussion concerning the City, and its finances, see “Appendix A—City of Boston, Massachusetts, Information
Statement Dated March 1, 2017 and “Supplement Dated May 31, 2017 to Information Statement Dated March 1,
2017” (collectively, the “Information Statement”).
As the economic hub of New England, Boston is a center for professional, financial, higher educational and
medical services, and the focus of tourist and convention travel in New England. For a description of certain
demographic and economic information about the City, see “Appendix A—Exhibit III—City of Boston—Selected
Demographic and Economic Information.”
SECURITY FOR THE BONDS
The Bonds will be valid general obligations of the City, for the payment of the principal of and interest on
which the full faith and credit of the City will be pledged. To the extent not paid from other legally available
revenues of the City, the Bonds are payable from ad valorem taxes which may be levied upon all taxable property in
the City without limit as to rate or amount.
Chapter 643 of the Acts of 1983 of the Commonwealth, as amended (the “Bond Procedure Act of 1983”),
requires that the debt and interest charges on all general obligation indebtedness of the City (including the Bonds), if
not otherwise provided for, be included in the City’s annual tax levy. The Bond Procedure Act of 1983 also
mandates assessment of taxes in excess of the levy limits imposed by the statewide property tax limit (“Proposition
2½”) to the extent that the debt service on City obligations is not otherwise provided for in the tax levy or from other
sources, with no allowance made for any other expenditures of the City. See “City Revenues—Property Taxes—
Proposition 2½” in the Information Statement. Holders of City obligations do not have a statutory priority with
respect to or a security interest in the portion of the tax levy attributable to such obligations. See “City
Indebtedness—Classification of City Debt” in the Information Statement.
In the opinion of Bond Counsel, the City is subject to suit on the Bonds, and courts of competent jurisdiction
have power in appropriate proceedings to order payment of a judgment on the Bonds from available funds or, in the
absence of available funds, to order the inclusion of the required amount in the next annual tax levy. In exercising
their discretion as to whether to enter such an order, the courts could take into account all relevant factors, including
the current operating needs of the City and the availability and adequacy of other remedies. The Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court has stated in the past that a judgment against a municipality can be enforced by the taking
and sale of property of any inhabitant. There has been no judicial determination, however, as to whether the remedy
is constitutional under current due process and equal protection standards.

Payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds is not secured by or limited to a pledge of any particular
revenue source of the City. Chapter 190 of the Acts of 1982 of the Commonwealth (the “1982 Funding Loan Act”)
and the Bond Procedure Act of 1983 authorize the City to pledge to the payment of any of its general obligation
notes or bonds all or any part of the revenues of the City derived from any tax, fee, distribution or reimbursement
payable to the City (except distributions and reimbursements required by law to be specifically used for statutorily
defined purposes), including state aid distributions and the proceeds of the City’s annual property tax levy. No
obligations are currently outstanding which are secured by such a pledge. The Bond Procedure Act of 1983 also
authorizes the City to issue special obligation bonds payable solely from the revenues of a revenue-producing
facility, and Chapter 152 of the Acts of 1997, as amended (the “Convention Center Act”), authorizes the City to
pledge certain excise receipts and other revenues of the City to the payment of bonds of the City issued under the
authority of the Convention Center Act. As of the date of this Official Statement, the City is not authorized to issue
any additional bonds under the Convention Center Act and no special obligation indebtedness of the City remains
outstanding. See “City Indebtedness—Special Obligation Debt” in the Information Statement. To the extent required
for the payment of any such secured indebtedness, the revenues pledged to their payment would not be available to
pay the Bonds.
Except to the extent specifically pledged to the payment of certain indebtedness, state aid distributions to the
City are generally available for the payment of bonds or notes of the City, but, under certain circumstances, they
may be unavailable to the extent such distributions are applied to the payment of “qualified bonds” issued by the
City (none of which bonds have been issued), or to the extent that such distributions may be applied under state law
to the satisfaction of unpaid assessments due the Commonwealth from the City for debt issued by the Massachusetts
Bay Transportation Authority, or for obligations of the City or of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission issued to
the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust. See “City Indebtedness—Classification of City Debt” in the Information
Statement.
State statutes also provide that certain parking meter receipts may be used only for parking and related
purposes and, accordingly, monies derived from this source may be unavailable to pay general obligation bonds and
notes issued for other purposes. In addition, subject to certain limits, the City may annually authorize the
establishment of one or more revolving funds in connection with the use of certain revenues for programs that
produce those revenues. If it accepts certain statutory provisions, the City may also establish enterprise funds for
certain purposes, including for a health care, solid waste, recreational or transportation facility, and for police or fire
services. Under those provisions any surplus in the fund is restricted to use for capital expenditures or reduction of
user charges. The City has not established any such revolving funds or enterprise funds.
Section 19A of Chapter 44 of the General Laws provides, in part, that if the City is or is likely to be unable to
pay principal of or interest on any of its bonds or notes when due, it shall notify the state Commissioner of Revenue.
The Commissioner shall certify such inability to the State Treasurer. The State Treasurer shall pay the due or
overdue amount by the later of three days after the certification or one business day prior to the due date. This
payment is limited, however, to the estimated amounts distributable by the Commonwealth to the City during the
remainder of the fiscal year. If, for any reason, any portion of the certified sum has not been paid at the end of the
fiscal year, the State Treasurer shall pay it as soon as practicable in the next fiscal year to the extent of the estimated
distributions for such fiscal year. The sums so paid shall be charged with interest and administrative costs against the
distributions to the City. The foregoing provisions are not a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth. The
Commonwealth has not agreed to maintain existing levels of state distributions and the law requiring the
Commonwealth to use estimated distributions to pay debt service may be subject to repeal by future legislation.
Moreover, adoption of the state’s annual appropriation act is often delayed beyond the beginning of the fiscal year,
and estimated distributions which are subject to appropriation may be unavailable to pay local debt service until they
are appropriated.
The rights of the holders of the Bonds and the enforceability of payment of the Bonds may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights heretofore or
hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable and their enforcement may also be subject to the exercise
of judicial discretion in appropriate cases. Massachusetts municipalities are not currently authorized by the
Massachusetts General Laws to file a petition for bankruptcy under federal bankruptcy laws. In cases involving
significant financial difficulties faced by a single city, town or regional school district, the Commonwealth has
enacted special legislation to permit the appointment of a fiscal overseer, finance control board or, in the most
extreme cases, a state receiver. In a limited number of these situations, such special legislation has also authorized
the filing of federal bankruptcy proceedings, with the prior approval of the Commonwealth. In each case where such
authority was granted, it expired at the termination of the Commonwealth's oversight of the financially distressed
city, town or regional school district. To date, no such filings have been approved or made. No such legislation
currently applies to the City.

THE BONDS
Description
The Bonds will be dated the date of delivery thereof, expected to be June 12, 2017, and will mature on March
1 of the years, and in the amounts, and will bear interest calculated on the basis of 30-day months and a 360-day
year at the rates, shown on the cover of this Official Statement. Interest on the Bonds will be payable on September
1, 2017 and semiannually thereafter on each March 1 and September 1, provided that if such day is not a business
day, interest will be payable on the next business day.
The Bonds will be issued by means of a book-entry system, with bond certificates immobilized at The
Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). Bond certificates will not be available for distribution
to the public and will evidence ownership of the Bonds in principal amounts of $5,000 or integral multiples thereof,
with transfers of ownership effected on the records of DTC and its participants pursuant to rules and procedures
established by DTC and its participants. Interest on the Bonds will be paid on the interest payment dates or upon
redemption, and principal of the Bonds will be paid at maturity or upon redemption, to DTC or its nominee as
registered owner of the Bonds. Transfer of principal or redemption price and interest payments to participants of
DTC will be the responsibility of DTC; transfer of principal or redemption price and interest payments to beneficial
owners by participants of DTC will be the responsibility of such participants and other nominees of beneficial
owners. The record date for principal or redemption price and interest payments will be the fifteenth day of the
month next preceding a debt service payment date or, if such day is not a business day, the next succeeding business
day. The City will not be responsible or liable for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records maintained by
DTC, its participants or persons acting through such participants.
U.S. Bank National Association, Boston, Massachusetts, will act as paying agent for the Bonds (the “Paying
Agent”).
Authorization and Purpose
The Bonds will be issued pursuant to the Bond Procedures Act of 1983 and certain loan orders of the City
Council approved by the Mayor for the purpose of refunding certain outstanding general obligation bonds, as more
fully described under “Plan of Refunding,” below.
Redemption Prior To Maturity
Optional Redemption
The Bonds maturing on or before March 1, 2027 will not be subject to redemption prior to maturity. The
Bonds maturing on March 1, 2028 will be subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option of the City, on or
after March 1, 2027, as a whole or in part at any time by lot as selected by DTC and its participants, at a redemption
price equal to the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed, plus accrued interest to the redemption date.
Notice of Redemption
Notice of redemption of Bonds, specifying the numbers, series and maturities of the Bonds or portions thereof
to be redeemed and the redemption date, will be given by the Paying Agent not more than 60 days nor less than 30
days prior to the redemption date by notice mailed to DTC or its nominee, as registered owner of the Bonds to be
redeemed. The City will not be responsible for mailing notices of redemption to anyone other than DTC or its
nominee. Notice having been given, the Bonds or portions thereof called for redemption will become due and
payable on the designated redemption date. If on the redemption date monies are available for the redemption of the
Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, together with interest accrued to the redemption date, then interest on
such Bonds or portions thereof shall thereafter cease to accrue.
Book-Entry Transfer System
DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds. The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities
registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an
authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of the
Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of that maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.
DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New
York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the
Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code,
and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and
municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct
Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales
3

and other securities transactions, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and
pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC, is the holding company for DTC, National, and
Securities Clearing Corporation, and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing
agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated securities. Access to the DTC system is also available to
others as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly
(“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants
are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at
www.dtcc.com and www.dtc.org.
Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive
a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial
Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive
written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written
confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or
Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership
interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting
on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership
interests in the Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.
To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the
name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an authorized
representative of DTC. The deposit of the Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such
other DTC nominee do not affect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual
Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts
such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will
remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.
Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to
Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by
arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.
Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within a maturity of a series are being
redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such
maturity to be redeemed.
Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the Bonds
unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI procedures. Under its usual procedures,
DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the City as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede
& Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Bonds are credited on the
record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).
Principal or redemption price and interest payments on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or such other
nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct
Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the City or the
Paying Agent on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments
by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the
case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the
responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC or, its nominee, the Paying Agent, or the City, subject to any
statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal or redemption price
and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is
the responsibility of the City or the Paying Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants shall be the
responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners shall be the responsibility of
Direct and Indirect Participants.
DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by
giving reasonable notice to the City or the Paying Agent. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor
securities depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered to DTC.
The City may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a
successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certificates will be printed and delivered.

for the convenience of bondholders only at the time of issuance of the Bonds and the City does not make any representation with
respect to such numbers or undertake any responsibility for their accuracy now or at any time in the future.

Upon delivery of the Bonds, the City will enter into a Refunding Escrow Agreement (the “Escrow
Agreement”) with U.S. Bank National Association, Boston, Massachusetts, as refunding escrow agent (the “Escrow
Agent”) to provide for the refunding of the Refunded Bonds. Upon receipt of the proceeds of the Bonds, the City
will transfer proceeds to the Escrow Agent for deposit in a Refunding Escrow Fund established under the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent will invest such amount in direct obligations of the United States of America or
obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America (“Governmental Obligations”) maturing in
amounts and on dates, and bearing interest at rates, sufficient without reinvestment to pay when due the interest on,
and upon redemption, the outstanding principal of, the Refunded Bonds. Amounts to be used to pay the Current
Refunded Bonds may also be invested in money market funds that invest in Government Obligations. The
Refunding Escrow Fund, including the interest earnings on the Government Obligations, is pledged for the benefit
of the holders of the Refunded Bonds.
Verification of Mathematical Accuracy
Robert Thomas CPA, LLC, will verify from information provided to them the mathematical accuracy as of the
date of the closing on the Bonds, of (i) the computation contained in the provided schedules to determine that the
anticipated receipts from the Government Obligations and cash deposits, to be held in escrow, will be sufficient to
pay, when due, the principal of and interest on the Refunded Bonds, and (ii) the computation of yield on the
Government Obligations contained in provided schedules used by Bond Counsel in its determination that the interest
on such Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Robert Thomas CPA, LLC, will
express no opinion on the assumptions provided to them, nor as to the exemption from taxation of the interest on the
Bonds.

LITIGATION
No litigation is pending or, to the knowledge of the City’s Corporation Counsel, threatened (a) seeking to
restrain or enjoin the issuance or delivery of the Bonds, (b) contesting or affecting any authority for or the validity of
the Bonds, (c) contesting the power of the City to issue the Bonds or the power of the City to offer and sell the
Bonds to the purchaser(s) thereof, (d) contesting the power of the City to levy and collect taxes to pay the Bonds, (e)
contesting the corporate existence or boundaries of the City, or (f) contesting the title of officials of the City who
have acted with respect to the proceedings for the issuance and sale of the Bonds to their respective offices.
There are pending in courts within the Commonwealth various suits in which the City is a defendant. No
litigation is pending or threatened which is likely to result, either individually or in the aggregate, in final judgments
against the City which would affect materially its ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds when due
or which would affect materially its financial condition.
Telecommunications providers, Verizon and RCN filed appeals with the Appellate Tax Board (“ATB”) for
fiscal 2012-2015 claiming that Boston and other Massachusetts cities and towns that classify their tax rates have
disproportionately assessed the tax on their personal property in violation of the Massachusetts Constitution. The
companies challenged Chapter 40, section 56 of the Massachusetts General Laws, which was enacted after a 1978
amendment to the state constitution that provided for the current system of classified tax rates for residential and
business property. The ATB rejected the companies’ arguments, finding in favor of the City in October 2014. The
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (“SJC”) denied the appeal of the companies and affirmed the decision of the
ATB in November 2016.
TAX EXEMPTION
In the opinion of Locke Lord LLP, Bond Counsel to the City (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of
existing laws, regulations, rulings, and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, compliance with certain
covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”). Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the
Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum
taxes, although Bond Counsel observes that such interest is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating
corporate alternative minimum taxable income. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other federal tax
consequences arising with respect to the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the
Bonds.
The Code imposes various requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax
purposes of interest on obligations such as the Bonds. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in
interest on the Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of
original issuance of the Bonds. The City has covenanted to comply with such requirements to ensure that interest on
the Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes compliance with
these requirements.
Bond Counsel is also of the opinion that, under existing law, interest on the Bonds is exempt from
Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property taxes. Bond
Counsel has not opined as to other Massachusetts tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds. Prospective
Bondholders should be aware, however, that the Bonds are included in the measure of Massachusetts estate and
inheritance taxes, and the Bonds and the interest thereon are included in the measure of certain Massachusetts
corporate excise and franchise taxes. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion as to the taxability of the Bonds or the
income therefrom or any other tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds under the laws of any state other
than Massachusetts.
A complete copy of the proposed form of the opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to the Bonds is set forth in
Appendix B hereto.
To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at maturity of such
Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the term of the Bonds), the
difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the accrual of which, to the extent properly allocable to each owner
thereof, is treated as interest on such Bonds which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes
and is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes. For this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of
the Bonds is the first price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of the Bonds is sold to the public
(excluding bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters,
placement agents or wholesalers). The original issue discount with respect to any maturity of the Bonds accrues
daily over the term to maturity of such Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded semiannually
(with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The accruing original issue discount is added to the
adjusted basis of such Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon disposition (including sale, redemption, or
payment on maturity) of such Bonds. Bondholders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax
7

consequences of ownership of the Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of purchasers who do
not purchase such Bonds in the original offering to the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such
Bonds is sold to the public.
Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount greater than the stated principal
amount to be paid at maturity of such Bonds, or, in some cases, at the earlier redemption date of such Bonds
(“Premium Bonds”), will be treated as having amortizable bond premium for federal income tax purposes and
Massachusetts personal income tax purposes. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the
case of obligations, such as the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes. However, a Bondholder’s basis in a Premium Bond will be reduced by the amount of
amortizable bond premium properly allocable to such Bondholder. Holders of Premium Bonds should consult their
own tax advisors with respect to the proper treatment of amortizable bond premium in their particular circumstances.
Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not
taken) or events occurring (or not occurring) after the date of issuance of the Bonds may adversely affect the value
of, or the tax status of interest on, the Bonds.
Prospective Bondholders should be aware that from time to time legislation is or may be proposed which, if
enacted into law, could result in interest on the Bonds being subject directly or indirectly to federal income taxation,
or otherwise prevent Bondholders from realizing the full benefit provided under current federal tax law of the
exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross income. To date, no such legislation has been enacted into law.
However, it is not possible to predict whether any such legislation will be enacted into law. Further, no assurance
can be given that any pending or future legislation, including amendments to the Code, if enacted into law, or any
proposed legislation, including amendments to the Code, or any future judicial, regulatory or administrative
interpretation or development with respect to existing law, will not adversely affect the market value and
marketability of, or the tax status of interest on, the Bonds. Prospective Bondholders are urged to consult their own
tax advisors with respect to any such legislation, interpretation or development.
Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes and is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or
the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds may otherwise affect the federal or state tax liability of a Bondholder.
Among other possible consequences of ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the
Bonds, the Code requires recipients of certain social security and certain railroad retirement benefits to take into
account receipts or accruals of interest on the Bonds in determining the portion of such benefits that are included in
gross income. The nature and extent of all such other tax consequences will depend upon the particular tax status of
the Bondholder or the Bondholder’s other items of income, deduction or exclusion. Bond Counsel expresses no
opinion regarding any such other tax consequences and Bondholders should consult with their own tax advisors with
respect to such consequences.
CREDIT RATINGS
Moody’s Investors Service Inc., 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, and
S&P Global Ratings, 55 Water Street, New York, New York, have assigned the ratings of “Aaa” and “AAA,”
respectively, to the Bonds, reflecting the City’s capacity to pay debt service. Such ratings reflect only the views of
such organizations and any desired explanation of the significance of such ratings should be obtained from the rating
agency furnishing the same. Generally, a rating agency bases its rating on the information and materials furnished to
it and on investigations, studies and assumptions of its own. There is no assurance that any such ratings will
continue for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely by the
rating agency concerned, if in the judgment of such rating agency, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward
revision or withdrawal of any such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Bonds.
COMPETITIVE SALE OF BONDS
The Bonds were offered for sale by the City on May 31, 2017 in accordance with the Official Notice of Sale
dated May 24, 2017 (the “Official Notice of Sale”).
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (“Bank of America”) was the successful bidder for the Bonds. Information
provided by Bank of America regarding the interest rates and reoffering yields of the Bonds is set forth on the front
cover of this Official Statement. The Bonds are being purchased from the City by Bank of America at an aggregate
price of $65,963,602.62, reflecting the principal amount of $58,370,000.00, plus net original issue premium of
$7,635,420.75, less underwriter’s discount of $41,818.13.
Bank of America and any of their respective associates underwriting the Bonds may offer to sell the Bonds to
certain dealers and others at prices other than the initial offering prices, and the public offering prices may be
changed from time to time by the underwriters.

LEGAL MATTERS
All legal matters incidental to the authorization and issuance of the Bonds are subject to the approval of Locke
Lord LLP, Boston, Massachusetts, Bond Counsel to the City. Reference should be made to the form of opinion of
Bond Counsel set forth in Appendix B for the matters to be covered therein. In addition, Corporation Counsel of the
City will certify as to the accuracy of the statements contained in the first paragraph under the caption “Litigation.”
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The financial statements of the City of Boston included as Exhibit I to Appendix A of this Official Statement
have been audited by KPMG LLP, independent auditors, to the extent and for the period indicated in their report
thereon.
FINANCIAL ADVISOR
FirstSouthwest, a Division of Hilltop Securities Inc. has served as financial advisor to the City for the issuance
of the Bonds.
First Southwest Company (“FirstSouthwest”) merged with its common control affiliate, Hilltop Securities Inc.
(“HilltopSecurities”). The merger was completed at the close of business on January 22, 2016, at which time
HilltopSecurities, as the surviving entity, automatically assumed all rights and obligations of FirstSouthwest. The
firm’s municipal advisory business will continue to operate as FirstSouthwest, a Division of Hilltop Securities Inc.
CONTINUING DISCLOSURE
In order to assist the underwriter in complying with Rule 15c2-12 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “Rule”), the City will covenant for the benefit of owners of the Bonds to provide certain financial
information and operating data relating to the City by not later than 365 days after the end of each fiscal year (the
“Annual Report”), and to provide notices of occurrence of certain enumerated events. The covenants will be
contained in a Continuing Disclosure Certificate, the proposed form of which is provided in Appendix C (the
“Certificate”). The Certificate will be executed on the delivery date of the Bonds and incorporated by reference in
the Bonds. The City has executed previous undertakings to provide annual reports or notices of material events in
accordance with the Rule and to the best of its knowledge has never failed to comply in all material respects with
any such undertaking within the previous five years. The City has implemented procedures to ensure timely filing of
annual reports and notices of certain enumerated events required under its continuing disclosure undertakings.
In order to assist the City in carrying out its obligations under the Certificate and under its other continuing
disclosure undertakings, the City has entered into an agreement with Digital Assurance Certification, LLC (“DAC”)
pursuant to which DAC serves as dissemination agent for the City with respect to the continuing disclosure filings
required to satisfy such obligations.
MISCELLANEOUS
This Official Statement is not to be construed as a contract or agreement between the City and the purchasers
or holders of any of the Bonds. Any statements made in this Official Statement involving matters of opinion are
intended merely as opinion and not as representation of fact. The information and expressions of opinion herein are
subject to change without notice and neither the delivery of this Official Statement nor any sale of the Bonds shall,
under any circumstances, create any implication that there has been no change in the affairs of the City, or its
agencies and authorities, since the date hereof.

Under the heading “Fiscal 2017 Budget” on page A-15
The information under the headings “Expenditures” and “Revenues” is hereby deleted and replaced with the
following:
Expenditures
In fiscal 2017, the City’s budgeted expenditures total $2.99 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed expenses, representing an increase of $115.0 million or 4.0% from fiscal 2016
actual expenditures. Budgeted fiscal 2017 departmental expenditures compare with fiscal 2016 expenditures as
follows. City Departments increase $48.2 million or 4.2%. In fiscal 2017 the growth in City Departments is based
on several factors, the fiscal 2017 budget has rightsized the public safety overtime budgets with the expectation that
there will not be overtime budget shortfalls similar to fiscal 2016 and prior. A supplemental budget was passed in
March 2017 totaling $7.7 million to cover the fiscal 2017 costs of a settled collective bargaining agreement with the
Boston Police Patrolman’s Association. Additionally, the cost growth for employee benefits like health insurance
and Medicare contributions plus a one-time $4 million payment to the Boston Housing Authority to support public
safety efforts are reflected in City Departments in fiscal 2017.
The School Department expenditures increase $15.4 million or 1.5% which reflects collective annual step
increases for teachers. The School Department continues to experience expenditure pressure particularly in the area
of student transportation and continues to explore cost reduction measures. The School Department is not currently
anticipating a budget deficit in fiscal 2017
The Collective Bargaining Reserves increases $16 million which reflects limited funding for successor union
contracts $7 million for City Departments and $9 million for Boston Public Schools.
The appropriation to the OPEB Trust Fund is level-funded at $40.0 million. Budgeted fixed expenses for fiscal
2017 compare with fiscal 2016 actual expenditures as follows: Pensions increase $2.8 million or 1.4%, Debt Service
increases $17.4 million or 11.0%; and State Assessments increase $15.2 million or 6.6%.
The increase in budgeted pension costs is due to the regular increase provided by the pension funding schedule
as approved by the state actuary. Pension expenses are mandated by the City’s pension funding schedule and are a
legal obligation of the City. For more on Pensions, see “Employee Benefits—Retirement Systems,” below. State
assessments are also mandatory; the amounts are determined by the Commonwealth. Most of the increase in State
Assessments is for charter school tuition totaling $14 million, followed by the assessment to the City for
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (“MBTA”) service.
Revenues
Budgeted revenues for fiscal 2017 are expected to total $2.99 billion, an increase of $113.1 million or 3.9%
from fiscal 2016 actual revenues.
Selected fiscal 2017 budgeted revenues compare with fiscal 2016 actual revenues as follows: The budgeted
Gross Property Tax Levy (including new growth) increases $123.6 million or 6.3%; Excises decrease $35.5 million
or -15.9%; Chapter 121A revenues decrease $16.6 million or -34.5%; Misc. Department Revenues decrease by $7.4
million or -11.7%; Licenses and Permits decrease $12.0 million or -16.1%; State Aid increases by $8.3 million or
2.0% and Non-Recurring Revenue increases by $44 million or 100.0% to fund the OPEB Trust Fund and a one-time
appropriation to the Boston Housing Authority.
The growth in budgeted Property Tax is due to the allowable increase of the City's levy by 2½% and strong
new growth that is excluded from the levy limit. New growth is $74.7 million in FY17 – a solid level of growth and
a marked improvement over previous years. The Property Tax, the City’s largest source of revenue, has become
increasingly important to the City’s revenue growth given the recent fluctuations in state aid from the
Commonwealth—the City’s second largest single source of revenue, see “City Revenues—State Aid.” The City has
always increased the Property Tax levy annually by the maximum amount allowed under statutory limits.

S-4

The decrease in budgeted Excises and Misc. Department Revenue is largely due to conservative revenue
estimates across all categories. Chapter 121A revenue declined as expiring 121A projects converted to property
taxes. The decrease in Licenses & Permits is due to a conservative estimate of building permit revenue. The
increase in State Aid is due to increases in the reimbursement for charter school tuition to Unrestricted General
Government Aid. For more detailed information regarding State Aid, see “City Revenues—State Aid.”
It is expected that in fiscal 2017 the City of Boston will meet its revenue budget in the aggregate and will have
sufficient revenue to support emergency spending for snow removal and other public safety costs.

Prior to the heading “Fiscal 2018 and 2019 Forecasts” on page A-16 the following paragraph is inserted:
Recommended Fiscal Year 2018 Budget
Pursuant to state law, the Mayor must submit the City’s annual operating budget to the City Council not later
than the second Wednesday in April for the Council’s review and approval. The Mayor filed the Fiscal Year 2018
Recommended Operating Budget and Capital Plan with the City Clerk on April 13, 2017. The Fiscal Year 2018
Recommended Operating Budget of approximately $3.14 billion represents a $143.6 million or 4.8% increase over
the fiscal 2017 budget. The property tax levy net of the required overlay reserve is expected to increase by $110.7
million or 5.4%. State Aid is projected to grow $10.6 million or 2.5%, and local receipts are projected to grow by
$26.3 million or 5.8% over the fiscal 2017 budget. On the spending side of the operating budget, total proposed
departmental appropriations would increase by $94.0 million or 4.0% - and fixed costs would increase by $49.7
million or 8.0 %. In addition to the operating budget, $259.1 million in new capital authorizations were submitted by
the Mayor to support the $2.08 billion fiscal year 2018-2022 capital plan.

Under the heading “Fiscal 2018 and 2019 Forecasts” on page A-16
Delete the second paragraph in its entirety and insert the following paragraph:
Since the publication of the forecasts, the City has released a balanced Fiscal Year 2018 Recommended Budget.
While the City has not published an updated forecast for fiscal 2018 and 2019, revenue would need to grow by 3.2%
or $100.3 million over the Fiscal Year 2018 Recommended Budget to meet the costs outlined in the fiscal 2019
forecast. The City will release an updated forecast for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 with the Fiscal Year 2018
Adopted Budget published in September 2017.
Under the heading “Cash Balances” on page A-19
The following information is added to the table on page A-19:

Under the heading “Capital Planning and Borrowing Program” on page A-38
The following paragraphs are inserted at the end of this section:
In April 2017, the Mayor released the $2.08 billion Fiscal Year 2018 - 2022 Capital Plan and submitted $259.1
million in new capital authorizations to the City Council to support the plan. The plan includes projects that improve
the physical condition of schools, parks, community centers, libraries, public safety facilities, and equipment across
the City. The plan is guided by Imagine Boston 2030 and the schools, streets, arts, climate and resilience plans
under its umbrella. This year’s plan assumes $950 million in new general obligation borrowings over the next five
years, a 22.6% increase over last year’s plan. This includes planned borrowings of $173 million in fiscal 2018, $177
million in fiscal 2019, and $200 million in fiscal 2020-2022. This borrowing level is projected to remain below 7%
of expenditures, which is within the City’s debt affordability policy. This plan assumes no change to the City’s debt
management policies including that at least 40% of the overall debt is repaid within five years and 70% within ten
years.
On April 4, 2017, the City issued $150 million in general obligation bonds to fund diverse investments across a
variety of the City's capital assets. Examples of projects funded through this bond issue include: $17.9 million for
communications infrastructure upgrades for the Boston Police Department’s radio system, $12.2 million for a
renovation of the Eliot School located at 585 Commercial Street, and $10 million for construction of a new STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) school for grades 6-12 that will open in September 2018.
Under the heading “Employee Benefits” on page A-39:
The following paragraph is inserted after the third paragraph on page A-41:
The Boston Retirement System (BRS) is currently considering a proposal to increase the retiree Cost of Living
Adjustment ("COLA") base from $13,000 to $14,000, to be effective as of July 1, 2017. The currently estimated
effect of this increase on the unfunded actuarial accrued liability at July 1, 2017 for BRS - Excluding Teachers is an
increase in such liability of approximately $25.4 million. The currently estimated annual additional cost associated
with this increase ranges from approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2018 to $6.3 million in fiscal 2025. The BRS
Board is scheduled to vote on this matter on June 21, 2017. If this proposal is approved, the City expects to be able
to cover the additional fiscal 2018 pension expense with expected fiscal 2018 revenue.

A description of certain City principal governmental services follows:
Schools
The City’s School Department provides both basic education and college preparatory curricula as
well as specialized vocational educational programs. The school system enrolled approximately 56,000
students for the 2016-2017 school year, roughly the same as the previous year. There are 125 schools in the
Boston Public Schools, including: 8 schools for early learners, 40 elementary schools (K-5), 32 elementary
& middle schools (K-8), 6 middle schools (6-8), 4 middle & high schools (6-12), 1 K-12 school, 21 high
schools (9-12), 3 exam schools (7-12), 6 special education schools, and 4 alternative (at-risk) schools and
programs.
Pursuant to Chapter 108 of the Acts of 1992, the City’s public schools are under the control of a
School Committee, which consists of seven members appointed by the Mayor. Members of the School
Committee have staggered four-year terms. In addition to appointing the Superintendent of Schools, the
Boston School Committee approves the School Department budget for submission to the Mayor, and by
and through the Superintendent, determines educational policy, makes all contracts for the purchase of
materials for the operations of the schools, and maintains and operates school properties. The
Superintendent of Schools has exclusive authority to make appointments and promotions for all teachers
and other School Department personnel except for the positions of Community Superintendent, Chairman,
Secretary, or Treasurer of the School Committee, and School Committee Administrative Assistants. The
School Committee appoints these excepted positions.
Public Safety
Public Safety is continuing to improve citywide service-delivery through consolidated and shared
resources to provide more effective and efficient public safety services to Boston’s communities.
The Boston Police Department maintains 11 neighborhood police stations and one headquarters
building. The Department also maintains 12 support locations, consisting of the Charlestown Neighborhood
Sub-Station, Police Academy, Firearms Training Range, Harbor Patrol Unit, Fleet Management Division,
Telecommunications Division, Evidence and Property Management Division, Special Operations Division,
Stress Support Unit, Recruit Investigation Unit, Field Support Division, and the K-9 unit.

A-7

The Fire Department maintains 40 facilities consisting of 34 neighborhood fire stations, one marine
unit, a training academy, a fire alarm division, a headquarters including a maintenance division, a fire
investigation building including a fire prevention division, and a high-pressure pumping station.
The Mayor’s Office of Emergency Management coordinates and directs Boston’s interdepartmental
and multi-jurisdictional homeland security activities by advising the Mayor on issues and obtaining and
managing outside funding.
Public Health
The Boston Public Health Commission (“BPHC”), successor to the City’s Department of Health and
Hospitals, is a body politic and corporate separate from the City created in 1996 when the operations of the
City’s former acute-care hospital, Boston City Hospital, were consolidated with the operations of Boston
University Medical Center Hospital under the control of the Boston Medical Center Corporation
(“BMCC”), a private, Massachusetts non-profit corporation. The BPHC is governed by a seven-member
board, six of whom are appointed by the Mayor, subject to confirmation by the City Council, and one of
whom, as the chief executive officer of BMCC, serves ex-officio. The BPHC functions as the City’s board
of health and operates a wide range of public health programs throughout the City funded from public and
private grants and City appropriations. The BPHC is a discretely presented component unit for GAAP
reporting purposes in the City’s annual audited financial statements. See “City Indebtedness—Debt of
Agencies Related to the City—Boston Public Health Commission” and “Employee Benefits.”
Public Works
The Public Works Department constructs and maintains highways, sidewalks, street lighting and
bridges, and oversees snow removal, street cleaning, refuse removal and recycling.
The Boston Water and Sewer Commission, is an independent body politic and corporate and a
political subdivision of the Commonwealth created in July 1977, and is responsible for the operation and
maintenance of the City’s water, sewer, and storm water drainage systems, the construction of
improvements to those systems, and the collection of user charges for its services. See “City
Indebtedness—Debt of Agencies Related to the City—Boston Water and Sewer Commission” below.
Other Services
The Boston Public Library system is made up of the Central Library in Copley Square, 24 branches
throughout the City, a map center, business library, and a website providing digital content and services.
The Parks and Recreation Department manages approximately 2,200 acres of active, passive and historic
parkland. The 2,200 acres of land include 272 parks, playgrounds, squares, malls, plazas, and other
miscellaneous sites; 16 historic and three active cemeteries; one greenhouse facility; and approximately
33,600 street trees.
Suffolk County
While existing state law provides that the Mayor and City Council serve as the Commissioners of
Suffolk County, which includes the cities of Boston, Chelsea, Revere and the Town of Winthrop, all of the
functions and costs of county government (including the county courts, registry of deeds and the Office of
the Suffolk County Sheriff) have been assumed by the Commonwealth, except for an annual assessment by
the Commonwealth for the purpose of funding the unfunded portion of pension liability for retirees of the
Office of the Suffolk County Sheriff who retired prior to January 1, 2010. This annual assessment can be
no greater than the City’s fiscal 2009 appropriation to support the Office of the Suffolk County Sheriff of
approximately $4.0 million, and will terminate when the pension liability of these retirees is fully funded.

Employee Relations
Under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 150E, most municipal employees in the Commonwealth
enjoy the right to join labor unions and bargain collectively over wages and other terms and conditions of
employment. The Office of Labor Relations represents the Mayor and the City in all collective bargaining
matters with all unions of City employees except School Department employee unions. The School
Department’s labor relations personnel similarly represent the School Committee and consult with the
Office of Labor Relations regarding contract negotiations and other general labor matters. Additionally, the
Office of Labor Relations has actively assisted the Boston Public Health Commission in collective
bargaining negotiations with its 11 bargaining units and regularly interfaces with the Boston Public Health
Commission on labor and employment matters.
Nearly all of the City’s non-school department employees are organized into bargaining units
represented by various unions. Most of these unions are affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Three large unions,
the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (“AFSCME”) Council 93 (laborer
employees), the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) Local 285 (clerical employees), and the
Salaried Employees of North America (“SENA”) Local 9158 (middle manager employees) represent the
majority of the City’s non-public safety employees.
Police officers are represented by four distinct unions: 1) the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association;
2) the Boston Police Superior Officers Federation; 3) the Boston Police Detectives Benevolent Society; and
4) the Boston Police Detectives Benevolent Society, Superior Officers Unit. Firefighters and Fire Chiefs
are divided into two bargaining units represented by a single union: the International Association of
Firefighters Local 718.
Boston teachers, teacher aides, school nurses, and substitutes are in a collective bargaining unit
represented by the Boston Teachers Union, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO.
The Boston Public Schools and the City of Boston maintain a contract with a private vendor to
provide bus transportation for City of Boston students who require transportation. The personnel costs
under this contract are passed through to the City and the City participates in the collective bargaining
negotiations between the vendor and its employees.
The table below represents a summary of the bargaining units representing City employees, the
number of City employees represented by each bargaining unit, and the status of the City’s contract with
each bargaining unit.

The majority of unions covering City departments and Boston Public Schools have contracts which
expired on June 30, 2016, or in subsequent months. Negotiations for successor agreements are ongoing.
The City and the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association have agreed to a new contract through June 30,
2020. The agreement includes annual general wage increases of 2%, other benefit enhancements, and full
restoration of Quinn Bill benefits reduced by the State in 2009. The agreement is subject to appropriation
by the City Council. The City expects to cover costs through the budgeted collective bargaining reserve and
revenues in excess of those budgeted.

FINANCIAL OPERATIONS
Budget Process
Operating Budget
The City’s fiscal year begins July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following calendar year. Pursuant to
state law, the Mayor must submit an operating budget to the City Council by the second Wednesday in
April for its review and approval. Proposed appropriations for all departments and operations of the City
(except for the public schools and public health services) are prepared under the direction of the Mayor in
the Office of Budget Management (“OBM”). The Superintendent of Schools must submit a budget to the
School Committee by the first Wednesday in February. The School Committee must approve a budget by
the fourth Wednesday in March and forward this budget to the Mayor who may approve or reduce the total
recommended budget. The Mayor then submits the school budget to the City Council for appropriation by
the second Wednesday in May. In practice, the School Department appropriation request has been
presented to the City Council in coordination with the Mayor’s operating budget request in April. The
BPHC must submit a revenue and expenditure budget for public health services to the Mayor by the second
Wednesday in March. If the proposed budget provides for expenditures in excess of the BPHC’s projected
revenues from non-City sources, the Mayor may either approve or reject the budget. If the Mayor accepts
the budget, the amount required to fund the revenue deficiency (the “net cost of public health services”) is
included in the annual budget for the City submitted to the City Council in April of each year. The BPHC
must adopt its public health services budget by the second Wednesday in June.
The City Council may reduce or reject any item in the Mayor’s budget but may not, except upon the
recommendation of the Mayor, increase or add an item. The City, Boston Public Health Commission and
School Department operating budgets for fiscal 2017 were approved by the City Council on June 29, 2016.
See “Financial Operations—Fiscal 2017 Budget.” After approval of the budget and until the property tax
rate is officially determined in mid-December, the Mayor may submit to the City Council such
supplementary appropriation requests as are deemed necessary, including supplemental amounts for the
School Department and the Boston Public Health Commission. The Mayor may also submit to the City
Council supplementary appropriation requests subsequent to the setting of the property tax rate provided
that an available source of revenue is identified. Under certain circumstances, the Mayor may, by executive
order, require expenditures to be limited to an amount less than the appropriated level.
In the event that the City enters a fiscal year without an approved operating budget, the City
continues departmental operations on a “one-twelfth” budget, as provided in the City Charter. Under the
one-twelfth budget process, (a) payrolls for regular employees cannot exceed the average monthly
expenditure of the last three months of the preceding fiscal year, (b) total liabilities incurred in any month
cannot exceed amounts spent for similar purposes during any one month of the preceding fiscal year, and
(c) monthly expenditures for new departments cannot exceed one-twelfth of their current fiscal year’s
estimated costs.
By law, the City must establish its property tax rate each year so that the resulting property tax levy
complies with the requirements of Proposition 2½. (For a discussion of Proposition 2½, see “City
Revenues—Property Taxes—Proposition 2½.”) The amount raised in the tax levy equals the sum of (a) the
aggregate of all amounts appropriated, granted or lawfully expended since the last annual tax levy and not
provided for, plus (b) all debt and interest charges on general obligation debt of the City maturing during
the fiscal year and not otherwise provided for, plus (c) all amounts necessary to satisfy final judgments,
plus (d) provision for certain prior years’ deficits, less (e) the aggregate of all non-property tax revenues
projected to be received in the City’s General Fund in amounts certified or approved by the Commonwealth
for tax rate purposes. In general, the City is required to raise in the tax levy a deficit incurred on a statutory
accounting basis in the prior year’s operating budget, or a deficit incurred in the property tax abatement
reserves.

A-11

The City of Boston maintains a program-based budgeting system to track expenditures and service
levels by major functions or “programs.” This budgeting system complies with the standards of the
Government Finance Officers Association, which has consistently recognized the City’s efforts with its
Distinguished Budget Presentation Award.
Capital Budget
The Office of Budget Management manages the City’s capital plan, including evaluating the
condition of the City’s capital assets, forecasting the timing and financial requirements of new construction
and rehabilitation, and assessing the allocation of current and future resources to meet the City’s
infrastructure needs. Through an annually updated five-year capital plan, the City refines its capital needs
and resources each fiscal year. In April 2016, the Mayor released the fiscal 2017-2021 capital plan and
initiated loan orders for City Council consideration. There is no statutory time frame for requesting or
approving such orders. All fiscal 2017 capital authorizations were approved by the City Council.
OBM also provides ongoing project oversight during the implementation phase of capital projects.
The City reviews and approves all capital contracts and monitors project costs and schedules to ensure the
adequacy of available funding sources in accordance with the capital plan.
Summary and Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary Basis)—Fiscal 2013 to 2016 Actual
Results and Fiscal 2017 Budget
The following table shows the City’s General Fund budget for fiscal 2017, together with budgetary
actual results for fiscal 2013 through 2016. In accordance with state law and regulations, the City’s General
Fund budget as shown below is prepared on the “budgetary basis” instead of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Among the key differences between these
two sets of accounting principles are that “budgetary” records property tax as it is levied while GAAP
records it as it becomes susceptible to accrual, “budgetary” records certain activities and transactions in the
General Fund that GAAP records in separate funds, “budgetary” records as an expenditure any amount
raised to cover a prior year deficit, and as a revenue any available funds drawn from accumulated prior year
surpluses, while GAAP ignores these impacts from prior years. “Budgetary” records encumbrances and
continuing appropriations as the equivalent of expenditures but has no effect on GAAP expenditures. The
difference in accounting principles inevitably leads to varying results in excess or deficiency of revenues
over expenditures.

(1) Represents the budget at the time of the approval of the City’s tax rate by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue on
December 16, 2016 plus any supplemental appropriations or transfers since that date.
(2) If the City’s reserves for abatements prove at the end of the fiscal year to be insufficient to cover the City’s abatement liability,

shortfall. In fiscal 2017, the City has reserved 1.9% of the net levy for abatements.
(3) Available Funds is comprised of appropriations from the Parking Meter Fund and the Cemetery Trust Fund. Appropriations from
these funds are restricted to specific uses.
(4) Non-recurring revenue represents the use of available Budgetary Fund Balance of $40 million and $4 million from Sale of
Surplus Property Fund in fiscal 2017.
(5) The City’s appropriation to the OPEB Trust Fund is currently not a mandatory obligation and therefore, should not be considered
a “recurring expenditure.”
(6) Excludes noncontributory pensions and annuities included in City Departments with expenditures of $4.1 million in fiscal 2013,
$164 thousand in fiscal 2014, $3.3 million in fiscal 2015, $4.1 million in fiscal 2016 and budgeted at $5.3 million in fiscal 2017.

Fiscal 2013-2015 Actual Results
During the fiscal 2013 to 2015 period, the City continued its pattern of producing annual budget
surpluses as shown in the prior table. During this period the City’s property tax base expanded when
several large properties moved from exempt to taxable status adding additional property tax revenue in
excess of the allowable levy growth. In addition, growth in local revenue was mainly driven by increases in
local option taxes, i.e. room occupancy tax and restaurant meal tax, motor vehicle excise tax, as well as
growth in building permit revenue and payments in lieu of taxes.
In fiscal 2013 the City’s expenditures totaled $2.50 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed costs. Departmental expenditures totaled $2.05 billion and fixed costs
totaled $443.1 million. Total revenues equaled $2.50 billion.
In fiscal 2014, the City’s expenditures totaled $2.65 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed costs, representing an increase of $148.8 million or 6.0% over fiscal 2013.
Departmental expenditures grew by $102.9 million, or 5.0% from fiscal 2013 with the continued settlement
of several collective bargaining agreements along with an arbitrator’s award to the Boston Police
Patrolman’s Association in September 2013. Fixed costs grew by $45.9 million, or 10.4% with growth in
pension, debt service and state assessment costs. Total revenues equaled $2.65 billion.
In fiscal 2015, the City’s expenditures totaled $2.77 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed costs, which increased $128.2 million or 4.8% from fiscal 2014
expenditures. Within the category of City Departments the Snow Removal budget deficit totaling $19.9
million with snow costs higher than estimated in the budget due to unprecedented snowfall. The City
expects to receive $4.1 million from Federal Emergency Management Agency for costs incurred related to
the January 26 – 28, 2015 blizzard, $2.9 million of this reimbursement reduced the deficit for the City’s
snow removal budget in the fiscal 2015 operating budget and the remaining amount will reimburse costs
incurred in other departmental budgets. Total revenues equaled $2.78 billion.
Fiscal 2016 Actual Results
The following is a summary of the City’s fiscal 2016 actual results on a budgetary accounting basis.
Expenditures
In fiscal 2016, the City’s expenditures totaled $2.88 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed costs, which increased $108 million or 3.9% from fiscal 2015 expenditures.
Fiscal 2016 actual expenditures compare with actual fiscal 2015 expenditures as follows: City Departments
increased $19.5 million or 1.7%; the Public Health Commission increased $2.4 million or 3.2%; the School
Department increased $41.4 million or 4.2%. Actual fixed costs for fiscal 2016 compare with actual fiscal
2015 fixed costs as follows: Pensions increased $26.9 million or 15.9%; Debt Service increased $9.7
million or 6.6%; State Assessments increased $18.9 million or 8.9%; and Suffolk County Sheriff was level
with the prior year.
Within the category of City Departments, items to note are the Police and Fire appropriation deficits
totaling $19.5 million which were offset by a revenue surplus. These deficits are mainly the result of higher
than budgeted overtime expenses. Fiscal 2016 actual expenditures also reflect a deficit of $7 million in the
Execution of Courts account, resulting from a reserve set aside to pay for possible adverse legal rulings.
Revenues
Actual revenues for fiscal 2016 totaled $2.88 billion, an increase from fiscal 2015 actual revenues of
$102.6 million or 3.7%. Selected fiscal 2016 actual revenues compare with fiscal 2015 actual revenues as
follows: The Gross Property Tax Levy (including new growth) increased $88.0 million or 4.7%; Excises
increased $31.2 million or 16.2%; Chapter 121A revenues decreased $7.5 million or -13.5%; Fines
increased by $0.4 million or 0.7%; Interest on Investments increased $123.3 thousand or 202.1%; voluntary
Payment In Lieu of Taxes (“PILOT”) revenues increased $1.8 million or 3.6%; Licenses and Permits
increased by $1.9 million or 2.6%; and State Aid increased $8.2 million or 2.0%. Non-recurring revenue
was not utilized in 2016.
The increase in Excises was due to growth in Motor Vehicle, Room Occupancy, Aircraft Fuel and
Meals excises. Chapter 121A revenue declined as expiring 121A projects converted to property taxes. The
modest increase in Fines was due to increases in parking fines. The increase in Licenses & Permits was
due to increased building permit as well as street and sidewalk permit activity. The increase in State Aid
was due to increases in unrestricted general government aid, education aid as well as reimbursements for
charter school tuition. For more detailed information regarding State Aid, see “City Revenues—State Aid.”

A-14

In both fiscal 2015 and 2016, the City was able to fund the appropriation to the Other Post
Employment Benefits (“OPEB”) Trust Fund using recurring revenue sources instead of Budgetary Fund
Balance, which is available for appropriation only after certification of its value by the Massachusetts
Department of Revenue.
Fiscal 2017 Budget
The following is a summary of expectations regarding the City’s fiscal 2017 budget on a budgetary
accounting basis. The figures cited below are comparisons to fiscal 2016 actual figures.
Expenditures
In fiscal 2017, the City’s budgeted expenditures total $2.99 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed expenses, representing an increase of $107.2 million or 3.7% from fiscal
2016 actual expenditures. Budgeted fiscal 2017 departmental expenditures compare with fiscal 2016
expenditures as follows. City Departments increase $40.2 million or 3.5%. In fiscal 2017 the growth in
City Departments is based on several factors. The fiscal 2017 budget has right-sized the public safety
overtime budgets with the expectation that there will not be large overtime budget shortfalls similar to
fiscal 2016 and prior years. Additionally, the cost growth for employee benefits like health insurance and
Medicare contributions plus a one-time $4 million payment to the Boston Housing Authority to support
public safety efforts are reflected in City Departments in fiscal 2017.
The School Department expenditures increase $15.4 million or 1.5% which reflects annual step
increases for teachers. The School Department continues to experience expenditure pressure particularly in
the area of student transportation and continues to explore cost reduction measures. The School Department
is not currently anticipating a budget deficit in fiscal 2017.
The Collective Bargaining Reserve increases $13.3 million which reflects limited funding for
successor union contracts.
The appropriation to the OPEB Trust Fund is level-funded at $40.0 million. Budgeted fixed expenses
for fiscal 2017 compares with fiscal 2016 actual expenditures as follows: Pensions increase $2.8 million or
1.4%, Debt Service increases $20.4 million or 12.9%; and State Assessments increase $15.2 million or
6.6%.
The increase in budgeted pension costs is due to the regular increase provided by the pension funding
schedule as approved by the state actuary. Pension expenses are mandated by the City’s pension funding
schedule and are a legal obligation of the City. For more on Pensions, see “Employee Benefits—Retirement
Systems,” below. State assessments are also mandatory; the amounts are determined by the
Commonwealth. Most of the increase in State Assessments is for charter school tuition totaling $14.0
million, followed by the assessment to the City for Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (“MBTA”)
service.
Revenues
Budgeted revenues for fiscal 2017 are expected to total $2.99 billion, an increase of $105.3 million or
3.7% from fiscal 2016 actual revenues.
Selected fiscal 2017 budgeted revenues compare with fiscal 2016 actual revenues as follows: The
budgeted Gross Property Tax Levy (including new growth) increases $123.6 million or 6.3%; Excises
decrease $35.5 million or -15.9%; Chapter 121A revenues decrease $16.6 million or -34.5%; Misc.
Department Revenues decrease by $7.4 million or -11.7%; Licenses and Permits decrease $19.7 million or
-26.5%; State Aid increases by $8.3 million or 2.0% and Non-Recurring Revenues increase by $44 million
or 100.0% to fund the OPEB Trust Fund and a one-time appropriation to the Boston Housing Authority.
The growth in budgeted Property Tax is due to the allowable increase of the City's levy by 2½% and
strong new growth that is added to the levy limit. New growth is $74.7 million in fiscal 2017 – a solid level
of growth and a marked improvement over previous years. The Property Tax, the City’s largest source of
revenue, has become increasingly important to the City’s revenue growth given the recent fluctuations in
state aid from the Commonwealth—the City’s second largest single source of revenue, see “City
Revenues—State Aid.” The City has always increased the Property Tax levy annually by the maximum
amount allowed under statutory limits.
The decrease in budgeted Excises and Misc. Department Revenue is largely due to conservative
revenue estimates across all categories. Chapter 121A revenue declined as expiring 121 A projects
converted to property taxes. The decrease in Licenses & Permits is due to a conservative estimate of
building permit revenue. The increase in State Aid is largely due to increases in Unrestricted General
Government Aid. For more detailed information regarding State Aid, see “City Revenues—State Aid.”
A-15

It is expected that in fiscal 2017 the City of Boston will meet its revenue budget in the aggregate and
will have sufficient revenue to support emergency spending for snow removal and other public safety costs.
Federal Sequestration
Certain federal funding received by the City has been and is expected to be adversely affected by
continued implementation of sequestration, which began on March 1, 2013.
The City has issued general obligation bonds in the form of Build America Bonds (“BABs”),
Qualified School Construction Bonds (“QSCBs”), and Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds
(“RZEDBs”) (collectively, the “Tax Benefited Bonds”), under the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 (“ARRA”). Pursuant to ARRA, the City is entitled to receive cash subsidy payments from the
federal government, provided the City makes certain required filings in accordance with applicable federal
rules. Such interest subsidy payments are treated under federal law as overpayments of tax and,
accordingly, are subject to offset against certain amounts that may be owed by the City to the federal
government or its agencies. The City has issued approximately $106.6 million aggregate principal amount
of Tax Benefited Bonds.
The Internal Revenue Service, under the Budget Control Act of 2011, released notifications to the
City on four occasions since March 2013, stating that such interest subsidy payments are affected by
sequestration reduction rates for fiscal 2013 through 2017; the projected loss in cash subsidy payments
through fiscal 2017 is approximately $1.1 million. The City is obligated to make payments of principal and
interest on the Tax Benefited Bonds whether or not it receives interest subsidy payments and is able to
adjust for federal reductions under sequestration with available funding in debt service accounts. The City
does not currently believe that any reduction of cash subsidy payments will have an adverse effect on its
financial condition or its ability to pay debt service on its Tax Benefited Bonds. All subsidy payments are
expected to be subject to sequestration reductions through federal fiscal 2025, the rates to be set from time
to time.
Fiscal 2018 and 2019 Forecasts
At the time of publishing of the fiscal 2017 adopted budget, the City of Boston projected a $47
million budget deficit in fiscal 2018 and a $79 million deficit in fiscal 2019. These projected shortfalls in
fiscal 2018 and 2019 were driven in large part by growth in fixed costs, which are expected to increase by
approximately 9.3% in fiscal 2018, uncertain costs related to collective bargaining agreements and health
insurance cost escalation. Within the City’s fixed costs, the Office of Budget Management (OBM)
continues to project increasing Charter School tuition assessment, moderately growing debt service, and
scheduled pension cost increases. The forecast projected conservative revenue growth in fiscal 2018 and
2019, with strong property tax, moderate local receipts and stagnant local aid growth.
Since the publication of the forecasts, the fiscal 2017 property tax new growth revenue was certified
higher than projected, which will assist in closing the gaps for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. Through the
fiscal 2018 budget process, the City will update revenue and fixed costs assumptions with new information
and will take steps to reduce department costs. The City has given guidance to Boston Public Schools that it
can expect to see a fiscal 2018 appropriation totaling $1.061 billion. The City is also reviewing options to
establish a collective bargaining reserve in fiscal 2018 that would include estimates for contract settlements
for all of the Boston Public Schools unions. The costs associated with the union contract settlements will
eventually be transferred to the Boston Public Schools’ budget as the union contracts are settled. Boston
Public Schools has submitted a balanced budget proposal for fiscal 2018 to the School Committee for its
review and adoption by the end of March 2017.
The City will also continue to pursue opportunities to maximize increase state education aid revenue,
and achieve savings initiatives uncovered through departmental operational audits.
Financial Statements
The City engages independent certified public accountants to audit and report on its financial
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. An
external Audit Committee, appointed by the Mayor, monitors the progress of the annual audit, reviews the
recommendations of the accounting firm and reports the Committee’s activities and recommendations to
the Mayor and the City Council.
The City’s audited financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The accounts of the City are organized
on the basis of funds. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a set of self-balancing accounts
that comprise its assets, liabilities, deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources, net
A-16

position/fund balance, revenues and expenditures/expenses. For a discussion of the significant accounting
policies employed in preparing the City’s fiscal 2016 audited financial statements, see Note 2 to such
audited financial statements, which are attached hereto as Exhibit I. The City’s fiscal 2016 financial
statements received an unmodified opinion.
GAAP accounting differs from the “statutory” accounting or “budgetary” accounting basis prescribed
by the Bureau of Accounts of the Commonwealth, for the annual budget and property tax certification
process. The major differences are explained in Note 4 to the fiscal 2016 audited financial statements,
attached hereto as Exhibit I.
Attached hereto as Exhibit II are Schedules of Comparative Financial Statements for the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, which have been prepared by the City’s Auditing
Department based on information taken from the City’s audited financial statements for those fiscal years.

City of Boston Treasury Department.

Financial Administration
Pursuant to state law mandates and policy initiatives, the City has established a system of internal
management controls. These controls are designed to maximize revenue collections, monitor operating and
capital spending, evaluate infrastructure needs, and enhance the City’s internal control in business
procedures. Major components of the City’s system of financial management controls include:
Revenue Collections
The City has implemented a comprehensive accounts receivable management program that
coordinates the collection of departmental revenues. The City has afforded taxpayers the ability to remit
payment for licenses, permits, fees, and fines with credit and debit cards and has given taxpayers an
alternative choice in paying real estate taxes by use of online direct debit or credit card payments. The City
secures its statutory lien for delinquent real estate taxes with instruments recorded at the Suffolk County
Registry of Deeds (“tax takings”). For more information concerning tax takings and collection of
delinquent real estate taxes, see “City Revenues—Property Taxes—Delinquent Taxes and Tax Title.”
Debt Management
The City uses a comprehensive, interactive debt capacity model that assists debt management
administrators in evaluating the potential impact of debt issues on cash flow, credit and statutory debt
capacity.
The Treasury Department manages all City borrowings. The Treasury Department focuses on the
timing of borrowings to take advantage of favorable market conditions and manages the City’s cash flows
to help obviate the need for short-term borrowings for operating purposes. The Treasury Department has
established a series of debt management guidelines and has instituted a debt policy that direct the City’s
approach toward its debt management activities, including rapid debt repayment, the use of a debt capacity
A-19

model for establishing debt affordability, limitations on the level of variable rate debt the City will employ,
if any, maintenance of the relationship between debt and repayment sources, target savings for refundings,
and responding to and communicating with the financial community and the rating agencies. The City has
no outstanding variable rate debt.
Financial Management
Financial management is supported through the use of the Boston Administrative Information
Systems (“BAIS”). BAIS is an integrated financial and human capital management system that is designed
to track and control daily activities and report the financial position of the City. BAIS performs the
specialized functions of encumbrance control, budget control, position management, payroll allotment
reporting, fund accounting, and capital project and grant management. Real time edits prohibit excessive
commitments and overspending, while on-line access to information, including monthly revenue and
expenditure reports, allows department managers to evaluate directly the financial status of individual
programs and the entire department. The utilization of these systems supports the rigorous monitoring and
reporting requirements enforced by the City.
The City of Boston has consistently received unmodified opinions on the audit of its Basic Financial
Statements and has been presented with a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting
from the Government Finance Officers Association for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
(“CAFR”) since fiscal 1995. In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, a governmental unit
must publish an easily readable and efficiently organized CAFR. The CAFR must satisfy both GAAP and
applicable state and local legal requirements.
Investment Policy
The City has enacted and annually reviews and updates its investment policy statement that dictates
the types of investments made by the City Treasury. The policy also focuses on the appropriate balance of
liquidity and the rate of return on investments. Bond proceeds, in conformance with the City’s policy, are
invested in highly liquid, fully collateralized investments.
Performance Management and Program Evaluation
Boston About Results (“BAR”) is the City’s performance management and evaluation program. BAR
aims to create a sustainable and reliable performance management system which captures the core
functions of City departments and citywide strategic goals, assists in the decision-making process,
identifies areas of improvement, and effectively communicates performance results to a broad range of
stakeholders.
Using performance management as its foundation, BAR encourages organizational changes and
operational improvements that increase the effectiveness and productivity of City departments. The
program does this by providing reliable, objective, and independent information and reports to City
managers about department performance and operations.
Risk Management
The City’s Risk Management strategy focuses on reducing the costs of third party liabilities, worker
injuries, employee health care costs, and property damages, through internal claims management,
department accountability, and a structured self-insurance program.
Legal liabilities are capped per M.G.L. Chapter 258, and Corporation Counsel defends the City in any
lawsuits that arise from the normal course of operations. Civilian workplace injuries are managed through
the City’s Workers’ Compensation Program. Police and Fire Departments manage their uniformed injury
programs under M.G.L. Chapter 42 Section 111F. These costs are budgeted and funded through the
General Fund. Departments are charged for their share of costs in order to promote awareness and
prevention efforts.
Health benefits for over 29,000 City employees and retirees are managed by the Health Benefits
Program. Over 90% of the City’s share of health benefit costs are self-insured through internal service
funds established in compliance with M.G.L. Chapter 32B Section 3A. Actuarially determined reserves are
maintained in the Funds to stabilize rate increases and protect against large claims or cost increases.
Building damages are managed by individual departments, assisted by the Property & Construction
Management Department. Large damages are insured through a catastrophic property insurance policy,
which provides $100.0 million for all risk protection after a $10.0 million deductible, with a lower $1,000
deductible for fine arts. An additional boiler and machinery insurance policy provides up to $25.0 million
per incident.

A-20

For unexpected large costs in all categories just described, the City maintains a catastrophic risk
reserve, which had an available balance of $31.1 million at the end of fiscal 2016.
Energy Management
The Chief of Environment, Energy and Open Space and Chief Financial Officer are charged with
making decisions regarding the City’s procurement, use, and conservation of energy. In addition, the Chief
of Environment, Energy and Open Space monitors the City’s progress in meeting the greenhouse gas
reduction goals required by the City’s Climate Action Plan. The Municipal Energy Unit housed within the
Environment, Energy and Open Space Cabinet works with City departments and the Office of Budget
Management to develop design standards and implement measures that enhance the energy efficiency of
the City’s new construction and capital improvement projects.
Over the past six years, the City has achieved operational savings through the conversion of street
lights to newer fixtures using Light Emitting Diode (“LED”) technology. Starting in fiscal 2011, and
initially taking advantage of funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”), as well
as rebates from Eversource, formerly known as NSTAR - Boston Edison Company the street lights
converted under this program has saved $4.0 million annually from conversions completed since fiscal
2011.
In fiscal 2018, the City plans to begin implementing improvements which will result in utility cost
savings for City facilities, under an initiative entitled “Renew Boston Trust.” This initiative is not a trust in
the traditional sense, but a program to bundle municipal utility cost savings projects. The initial step is an
Energy Service Company (“ESCO”) conducting an Investment Grade Audit (“IGA”) of the City’s facilities
portfolio to identify projects with significant utility savings potential. The City expects to select projects
based upon the IGA analysis and implement the program through one or more contracts with the ESCO that
will provide long-term financial guarantees on the net savings for such projects. The City plans to finance
the program with general obligation bonds payable by means of the long-term savings guaranteed by the
ESCO.
To better track and control energy use, the City has re-procured services to support an Enterprise
Energy Management System (“EEMS”). The current EEMS enables the City to monitor and report on the
energy consumed by its 314 buildings and other fixed assets, and its vehicle fleet, and is used by the City to
meet its public reporting obligation under the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance.
The City’s electricity requirements have been met by third-party commodity supply contractors since
March 2005. To date, the amounts the City has paid to its third-party electricity suppliers have been less
than the amounts it would have paid if it had continued to accept default electric service from its local
distribution company, Eversource.

A-21

CITY REVENUES
The principal sources of City revenue available to meet operating expenditures are property taxes,
state aid, excise revenues, departmental revenues, and federal and state grants, all of which are described
below. Except as specifically noted, all amounts are stated on a budgetary accounting basis.
Property Taxes
Real and personal property taxes are the largest single source of the City’s revenue. The City’s gross
property tax levy for fiscal 2017 equals $2.09 billion, or 69.8% of City General Fund revenues of $2.99
billion budgeted for such period. Certain properties are subject to arrangements that suspend the imposition
of real property taxes at normal rates in order to encourage development. See “City Revenues—Property
Taxes—Revenues from Chapter 121A Properties” below.
As discussed below, Proposition 2½ limits the level of property taxation in the City. In fiscal 2017,
the City will again levy taxes below the 2.5% ceiling on the overall effective tax rate. The City is not
expected to reach the levy ceiling in the foreseeable future due to previous growth in the real estate market.
Proposition 2½
Proposition 2½ is a statewide tax limitation subject to amendment or repeal by the legislature that
imposes two separate limits on the annual tax levy of a city or town. The primary limitation of Proposition
2½ is that the property tax levy in any city or town in the Commonwealth cannot exceed 2.5% of the full
and fair cash valuation of the taxable real estate and personal property in that city or town (the “2½
ceiling”). The only exception is the temporary exclusion of debt service or capital costs from the levy
ceiling restrictions, as described below.
Within the limits of the 2½ ceiling, the Growth Levy Limit is a secondary limitation imposed by
Proposition 2½. The Growth Levy Limit prohibits the levy in a fiscal year from exceeding an amount equal
to 102.5% of the maximum allowable limit for the preceding year, subject to exceptions for the following:
property newly added to the tax rolls and valuation increases other than as a result of a general revaluation
(“new growth”); temporary exclusions from the tax levy limitation to pay for capital costs or debt service
on indebtedness; and “overrides,” which are permanent increases in the tax levy for general expenditures of
the city or town. Exclusions and overrides must be approved by a referendum of the voters of the city or
town. The levy is permanently increased by the addition of new growth and overrides, except that any
override to fund a stabilization fund will not be taken into account in calculating the maximum levy limit in
subsequent fiscal years unless the City Council votes to appropriate such increased amount in such
subsequent year to the stabilization fund. The exclusion of debt service by referendum temporarily
increases the levy amount and the duration of the specific debt excluded. The Growth Levy Limit may be
exceeded by an override in any year by a majority vote of the voters. An increase in the Growth Levy Limit
under this procedure, however, does not permit a tax levy in excess of the 2½ ceiling since the two
limitations apply independently. The applicable tax limits may also be reduced in any year by a majority
vote of the voters. The City’s gross levy in fiscal 2017 equals $2.09 billion. In fiscal 2017, the allowable
2.5% increase is $49.1 million, and “new growth” is $74.7 million.
In order to mitigate its adverse impact on local government revenues, Proposition 2½ limits the
annual rate of increase of aggregate, statewide assessments made upon cities and towns by the
Commonwealth and certain of its governmental entities, such as assessments made upon the City and
certain other cities and towns for the MBTA, to 2.5% of the prior year’s assessment. Proposition 2½ also
limits the motor vehicle excise tax rate to 2.5%.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Proposition 2½ described above, the City’s Bond Procedure Act of
1983 mandates assessment of taxes in excess of the Proposition 2½ levy limits to the extent that the debt
service on City obligations is not otherwise provided for in the tax levy or from other sources, with no
allowance made for any other expenditures of the City. See “City Indebtedness—Classification of City
Debt.”

Revaluation
State law mandates a revaluation of all taxable property every three years. These revaluations are
reviewed and certified by the Commonwealth. In the years between revaluations, the Commonwealth
requires municipalities to establish new values on the basis of market changes, using the most recent
revaluation as a basis. The City has adjusted certified property values in accordance with this procedure in
years when market conditions indicated such adjustment was necessary.
In November 2015, the City concluded work on its twelfth triennial revaluation for fiscal 2016, with
an assessment date of January 1, 2015. For fiscal 2017, assessments were based on market activity leading
up to the assessment date of January 1, 2016. Fiscal 2017 assessments reflected an active real estate market
with assessed values in most neighborhoods having increased over the prior year. See “City Revenues—
Property Taxation—Taxes by Use; Tax Rates.”

The City utilizes five classes of property for taxation purposes: (i) residential, (ii) open space land,
(iii) commercial, (iv) industrial and (v) personal property. Within limits under state law, the City may
determine the share of the annual levy to be borne by each of the categories. Under these statutory limits,
the residential tax rate cannot be given a discount greater than 50%, while the tax rate on the remaining
business classes of property cannot exceed 175% of the overall effective tax rate.
The City may also exempt a portion of the assessed valuation of residential real property when used
as the taxpayer’s principal residence. A recent change in state law allowed the City to increase the amount
of the residential exemption from up to 30% to 35% of the average assessed value of all residential
property in fiscal 2017. Each qualifying resident who receives the residential exemption has their taxable
assessed value reduced by $229,737 in fiscal 2017. The residential exemption has no impact on the overall
tax rate.

The Largest Taxpayers table includes entities with a fiscal 2017 tax liability greater than $15 million. The methodology used in creating
the table involves the search of the title holder(s) of all major parcels of property in the City. This methodology does not necessarily
locate all parcels owned by affiliates nor does it differentiate between percentage ownership in a particular parcel.

The City’s property tax bills are mailed quarterly in July, October, December, and April. The bills
mailed in July and October represent preliminary tax bills each equal to one quarter of the previous fiscal
year’s liability. The fair cash value of the property or assessment for the purpose of determining the new
fiscal year tax liability is reflected in the third and fourth quarter bills, which are mailed in December and
April. See “City Revenues—Property Taxes—Taxation by Use; Tax Rates.”
Delinquent Taxes and Tax Titles
Real and personal property taxes (not including motor vehicle, the room occupancy and the aircraft
fuel excises) are based on values established by the Assessing Department as of each January 1, and are due
in quarterly payments every August, November, February and May. Delinquent real estate and personal
property taxes are subject to a 14% per annum interest charge. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year in
which real estate taxes become delinquent, the City secures its lien for such taxes by taking legal title to all
delinquent properties, subject to the owners’ right of redemption. After this process, known as a “tax
taking,” is complete, interest accrues on outstanding amounts of delinquent real estate taxes at the rate of
16% per annum. If the taxes remain unpaid for a period of six months from the tax taking, the City may
petition the Land Court to foreclose the equity owner’s right of redemption. Upon foreclosure, the City may
then sell the property in order to liquidate the tax liability. The City estimates that the value of the
properties to which such tax titles are attached is substantially less than the amount of delinquent taxes,
charges, and interest owed.
Tax title receipts were $15.9 million, $16.1 million and $21.0 million, in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016,
respectively.
Revenues from Chapter 121A Corporations
A local government in cooperation with its redevelopment authorities may suspend the imposition of
real property taxes at normal levels on properties determined to be “blighted” in order to encourage
redevelopment of such properties by special corporations organized under Chapter 121A (“Chapter 121A
Corporations”). The City receives two principal sources of revenue from Chapter 121A Corporations. The
first consists of excise PILOTs for each Chapter 121A Corporation that are collected by the
Commonwealth and distributed to the City. The second form of revenue is contract payments resulting
from agreements that may be entered into between the Chapter 121A Corporation and the City relating to
City services available to the development.
Revenues received by the City from Chapter 121A Corporations for the last five fiscal years are
shown in the following table.

Community Preservation Act
The Massachusetts Community Preservation Act (the “CPA”) permits municipalities that accept its
provisions to levy a surcharge on its real property tax levy and to receive state matching funds for the
acquisition, creation, preservation, rehabilitation and restoration of open space, historic resources and
affordable housing. The provisions of the CPA must be accepted by the voters of the municipality at an
election after such provisions have first been accepted by either a vote of the legislative body of the
municipality or an initiative petition signed by 5% of its registered voters.
A municipality may approve a surcharge of up to 3% of the real property tax levy, and it may accept
one or more exemptions to the surcharge under the CPA, including an exemption for low-income
individuals and families and for low and moderate-income senior citizens, an exemption for $100,000 of
the value of each taxable parcel of residential real property, and an exemption for commercial and
industrial properties in municipalities with classified tax rates. The surcharge is not counted in the total
taxes assessed for the purpose of determining the permitted levy amount under Proposition 2½ (see
“Proposition 2½” above). A municipality may revoke its acceptance of the provisions of the CPA at any
time after 5 years from the date of such acceptance and may change the amount of the surcharge or the
exemptions to the surcharge at any time, provided that any such revocation or change must be approved
pursuant to the same process as acceptance of the CPA.
Any municipality that accepts the provisions of the CPA will receive annual state matching grants to
supplement amounts raised by its surcharge on the real property tax levy. The state matching funds are
raised from certain recording and filing fees of the registers of deeds. Those amounts are deposited into a
state trust fund and are distributed to municipalities that have accepted the provisions of the CPA, which
distributions are not subject to annual appropriation by the state legislature. The amount distributed to each
city and town is based on a statutory formula which requires that 80% of the amount in the state trust fund
be used to match an equal percentage of the amount raised locally by each city and town, and that the
remaining 20% of the amount in the fund be distributed only to those municipalities that levy the maximum
3% surcharge based on a formula which takes into account equalized property valuation and population,
resulting in larger distributions to those communities with low valuations and small populations. The total
state distribution made to any municipality may not, however, exceed 100% of the amount raised locally by
the surcharge on the real property tax levy.
The amounts raised by the surcharge on real property taxes and received in state matching funds are
required to be deposited in a dedicated community preservation fund. Each municipality that accepts the
provisions of the CPA is required to establish a community preservation committee to study the community
preservation needs of the community and to make recommendations to the legislative body of the
municipality regarding the community preservation projects that should be funded from the community
preservation fund. Upon the recommendations of the committee, the legislative body of the municipality
may appropriate amounts from the fund for permitted community preservation purposes or may reserve
amounts for spending in future fiscal years, provided that at least 10% of the total annual revenues to the
fund must be spent or set aside for open space purposes, 10% for historic resource purposes and 10% for
affordable housing purposes.
The CPA authorizes municipalities that accept its provisions to issue bonds and notes in anticipation
of the receipt of surcharge revenues to finance community preservation projects approved under the
provisions of the CPA. Bonds and notes issued under the CPA are general obligations of the municipality
and are payable from amounts on deposit in the community preservation fund. In the event that a
municipality revokes its acceptance of the provisions of the CPA, the surcharge shall remain in effect until
all contractual obligations incurred by the municipality prior to such revocation, including the payment of
bonds or notes issued under the CPA, have been fully discharged.
A-28

The City accepted the CPA in November 2016 and set the rate at 1%. The City intends to utilize CPA
revenues to help achieve its housing and economic goals of creating affordable housing units, restoring
parks and recreational open space, and preserving historical sites.
State Aid
State aid from the Commonwealth comprises the second largest single revenue source to the City’s
General Fund after the Property Tax. Over the course of the previous decade, support to municipalities
from the Commonwealth has been consistently reduced.
The City experienced reductions in actual state aid revenue totaling $102.9 million or -20.8%
between fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2012. While state aid began to recover in fiscal 2013 and 2014, state aid
declined again in fiscal 2015 by almost $9 million due to the Commonwealth underfunding the charter
school reimbursement account.
Distributions from the Commonwealth charter school reimbursement account are based on a formula
to provide transitional dollars to municipalities when a student leaves a district school for a charter school,
but this account is subject to appropriation. For the past three years the Commonwealth has underfunded
the charter school reimbursement account, which has resulted in $12 million less in fiscal 2015, $17 million
less in fiscal 2016, and a projected $19 million less in fiscal 2017 for Boston than full funding of the
formula would have provided.
In fiscal 2016, state aid increased by $8.2 million and it is budgeted to rise again by $8.3 million in
fiscal 2017. Adjusting for these changes, the total loss in state aid revenue between fiscal 2008 and fiscal
2017 (budgeted) amounts to $63.5 million or -13%.
The State Treasurer is empowered to deduct “assessments” from state aid amounts appropriated to the
City. The largest of these assessments is now that for Charter School Tuition followed by that for MBTA.
Charter Schools are public schools, open to all students that apply, that are funded by “tuition,” 100% of
which is paid by the students’ home or “sending” school district. A 2010 increase in the legislatively
imposed cap on charter school enrollments has caused this cost to grow rapidly. Under the 2010 legislation,
the cap ceased increasing in 2017, and now Boston’s charter school assessment is capped at 18% of net
school spending. In 2016, a proposed ballot initiative to further increase the Commonwealth charter school
cap was not approved by voters.
Assessments also include smaller charges for various state-provided services, which may include debt
service paid by the Commonwealth on “qualified bonds” and any sums allocable to the Boston Water and
Sewer Commission or the City that are due and unpaid on debt issued to the Massachusetts Clean Water
Trust (“MCWT”), formerly the Massachusetts Water Pollution Abatement Trust. The City has no
“qualified bonds” outstanding and has never been assessed for unpaid amounts due the MCWT.
“Net state aid” or, total state aid net of “assessments”, has declined more than state aid revenue due to
the rapidly increasing assessment for charter school tuition mentioned above. Between fiscal 2008 and
fiscal 2016, net state aid declined by $174.1 million or (48.1%). State Assessments are expected to increase
to $245.8 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $230.6 million in fiscal 2016.
Under the Massachusetts Constitution and state finance law, the State Treasurer has the authority to
delay the allotment of state aid appropriations under certain circumstances. In addition, the statute
governing the distribution of school aid provides that such payments are due only to the extent that
sufficient funds are available.
State School Building Assistance
Under its school building assistance program, the Commonwealth provides grants to cities, towns and
regional school districts for school construction projects. Until July 26, 2004, the State Board of Education
was responsible for approving grants for school projects and otherwise administering the program. Grant
amounts ranged from 50% to 90% of approved project costs. Municipalities generally issued bonds to
finance the entire project cost, and the Commonwealth disbursed the grants in equal annual installments
over the term of the related bonds. Approved project costs included the interest expense incurred on debt
issued by a municipality to finance the school project.
Due to demand for school building assistance grants far exceeding available funds, the state
legislature created the Massachusetts School Building Authority (“MSBA”) in 2004 to finance and
administer the school building assistance program. The MSBA has assumed all powers and obligations of
the State Board of Education with respect to the program. In addition to certain other amounts, the
legislation dedicates a portion of Commonwealth sales tax receipts to the MSBA to finance the program.

A-29

Projects previously approved for grants by the State Board of Education are entitled to receive grant
payments from the MSBA based on the approved project cost and reimbursement rate applicable under the
prior law. As of March 1, 2017, the City expects to receive $20.5 million in grant payments to offset its
outstanding debt service on school projects approved for grants under the prior law at a reimbursement rate
of 90% of approved project costs. The MSBA has paid and is expected to continue to pay the remaining
amounts of the grants for such projects in annual installments to reimburse debt service on bonds issued by
the City to finance such projects.
The MSBA in 2008 promulgated regulations with respect to the application and approval process for
new projects. The range of reimbursement rates for such projects has been reduced to between 40% and
80% of approved project costs. In addition, the MSBA expects to pay grants for such projects as project
costs are incurred pursuant to a project funding agreement between the MSBA and the municipality. In
most cases, the receipt of these progress payments from the MSBA will eliminate the need for the
municipality to borrow on a temporary basis to finance the MSBA’s share of project costs. However, none
of the interest expense incurred on debt issued by municipalities to finance their portion of the costs of new
projects will be included in the approved project costs eligible for reimbursement.
Currently, three City school projects are in the MSBA’s Core Program which can include extensive
repairs, renovations, additions, and new school construction. Projects go through several development
stages including feasibility studies, design development, construction, and project closeout. The early
stages assist the MSBA with managing its financial resources by identifying whether a School District is
ready to manage and fund a capital project. It helps determine a District’s financial and community
readiness to enter the capital pipeline. The ongoing analysis and consideration of the City’s project
proposal by the MSBA does not represent or imply a commitment by the MSBA to fund the project. The
MSBA’s financial commitment to a project is only determined through a project funding agreement after
careful analysis and the development of architectural and engineering documents. In 2014, the City entered
into a Project Funding Agreement for the construction of a new school in Roxbury. Through the PFA, the
City will receive a grant totaling 75.34% of eligible project costs. The school building is now under
construction and will be completed by December 2017. Two other projects are in the feasibility study
phase.
The City has twelve projects in the MSBA’s Accelerated Repair Program (“ARP”). The ARP funds
boiler, roof, and window/doors replacement projects with a focus on the preservation of existing assets
through energy-efficient and cost-saving upgrades, which will result in direct operational savings for school
districts. Seven City projects involve window and exterior door replacements, two projects are roof
replacements, and three are boiler replacement projects. The window replacement projects will begin
construction in late spring and will be completed by fall 2017. The roof and boiler projects will be
completed by 2018.
Excise Revenues
In addition to the major sources of revenue described above, the City receives various other types of
revenues. See “Financial Operations—Summary and Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary
Basis)—Fiscal 2013 to 2016 Actual Results and Fiscal 2017 Budget” above. The following is a description
of those and other significant excise revenue sources of the City.
Room Occupancy Excise
As is its option under state law approved in 1985, the City imposed a 4.0% local room occupancy
excise upon the transfer of occupancy of any room in a hotel, lodging house or motel. The Commonwealth
granted authority to municipalities in 2009 to increase the local option room occupancy excise up to 6.0%.
The City increased the local option room occupancy excise to 6.0%, effective October 1, 2009. The
Massachusetts Department of Revenue is responsible for collecting and remitting local option room
occupancy excise receipts to the City in arrears. The City’s room occupancy excise receipts totaled $71.1
million, $83.5 million, and $89.1 million in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
Aircraft Fuel Excise
The City also assesses an aircraft fuel excise upon the sale of jet fuel. The Commonwealth collects
this tax and distributes it to the City. The City’s aircraft fuel excise receipts totaled $37.1 million, $29.7
million, and $36.8 million in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. (Note, a late payment for aircraft
fuel excise in the amount of $7.6 million was received in fiscal 2016 rather than when due, in fiscal 2015.)

A-30

Motor Vehicle Excise
The Commonwealth assesses an excise on the registration of motor vehicles, the proceeds of which
are received by the municipality where the vehicle is principally garaged. The excise is a uniform rate of
$25 per $1,000 of vehicle valuation. The City’s annual motor vehicle excise receipts totaled $53.0 million,
$52.9 million, and $67.7 million in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
Meals Excise
The Commonwealth granted the option to municipalities in 2009 to levy a 0.75% excise on locally
sold prepared food and beverages. The Massachusetts Department of Revenue is responsible for collecting
and remitting meals excise receipts to the City. The City’s annual meals excise receipts totaled $24.4
million, $25.9 million, and $28.0 million in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
Vehicular Rental Surcharge
The Commonwealth imposes a $10 surcharge on each vehicular rental transaction contract in the
City. The City’s annual share of vehicular rental surcharges totaled $1.1 million, $0.3 million, and $1.6
million in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively.
Departmental Revenues
Several City departments generate significant revenues from fines, fees, charges and reimbursements.
Parking Fines
The City’s annual parking fine receipts totaled $56.5 million, $57.1 million, and $57.8 million in
fiscal 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively.
Building Permit Fees
The Inspectional Services Department performs a variety of functions for which fees are imposed
such as the granting of building permits. The City’s annual building permit fees totaled $40.1 million,
$51.7 million, and $52.3 million in fiscal 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively.
Municipal Medicaid Reimbursement
The Office of Budget Management oversees a vendor contract to collect federal reimbursements for
Medicaid eligible services provided through the Boston Public Schools. The City’s annual municipal
Medicaid reimbursement revenue totaled $6.2 million, $7.1 million, and $8.2 million in fiscal 2014, 2015,
and 2016, respectively.
Other Available Revenues
Under state law, proceeds of the sale of City facilities must be applied to the Surplus Property
Disposition Fund to be used to finance capital projects, unless the City Council, with the approval of the
Mayor, votes to credit to the General Fund the difference between the sale proceeds and the amount of debt
(both principal and interest) incurred in acquiring or improving the sold facility. As of June 30, 2016, there
was $17.0 million remaining in the Surplus Property Disposition Fund.
Grants
The City receives both federal and state grant funds, some of which are determined according to
formulas, and others that are awarded competitively. These monies are recorded in special revenue funds.
Federal Grants
Some major sources of federal grant funds in fiscal 2016 included: a Community Development Block
Grant (“CDBG”) Entitlement Program award of $25.4 million; a Home Investment Partnership Program
(“HOME”) award of $4.9 million; a Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (“HOPWA”)
award of $2.7 million and an Emergency Services Grant award of $1.5 million. The Department of
Neighborhood Development received an additional $25.4 million in federal competitive grants, mainly
related to the Continuum of Care Program.
Major sources of federal grant funds for programs of the Boston Public Schools included: a Title I
Elementary & Secondary Education Act of 1965 award of $29.7 million; Special Education Entitlement
Grant awards of $17.7 million; School Lunch Program and Summer Food Program awards of $38.5
million; and Title II teacher quality award of $6.3 million. The Boston Public Schools were also awarded
$10.6 million from a variety of other federal grant sources during the 2016 fiscal year. Total federal aid to
Boston Public Schools in fiscal 2016 was $102.8 million compared to $109.7 million fiscal 2015.

A-31

The City received a five year $15.5 million award from the US Federal Highway Administration
National Infrastructure Investments Program for the Connect Historic Boston project and a two year $12.8
million award from FEMA for Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER).
On January 25, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order (the “Order”) intended to enforce
the U.S. immigration laws. The Order includes a provision directing the Attorney General and the
Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that state and local jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply
with federal law concerning the provision of information on individuals' immigration status will not be
eligible to receive federal grants except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes.
In 2014, the Boston City Council and the Mayor approved an ordinance entitled the “Boston Trust
Act,” which governs how Boston law enforcement officials respond to federal civil immigration detainer
requests. The City Council reaffirmed this ordinance in 2016. This ordinance could possibly subject the
City to the loss of federal funds following implementation of the Order. The validity of the Order is
currently being challenged in court by various communities, including two other cities in Massachusetts.
The City currently receives significant amounts of annual federal grants, as described above. The
City cannot predict how the federal government will implement the Order, what impact, if any,
enforcement of the Order may have on the amount or timing of receipt of federal funds or the City’s
financial condition or what actions, if any the City might take in response to the Order or any action under
it.
State Grants
In addition to State Aid, the City also received state grants. In fiscal 2016, the Boston Police
Department received Community Services grant awards that totaled $5.3 million from the Massachusetts
Executive Office of Public Safety and Security.
Boston Public Schools were awarded approximately $10.2 million for early childhood, elementary
and secondary, and adult education. In addition, the state paid $18.7 million in Special Education
Reimbursement to the Boston School Department.

A-32

CITY INDEBTEDNESS
Classification of City Debt
Direct general obligation debt of the City is debt for which the City’s full faith and credit are pledged
and for the payment of which all taxable property in the City is subject to ad valorem taxation without limit
as to rate or amount. General obligation bonds of the City may also be secured in certain circumstances by
a pledge of specific City revenues. The special obligation debt of the City is debt, which may be secured
solely by a pledge of specific revenues derived from a revenue-producing facility of the City or for the
payment of which the City’s obligation is subject to annual appropriation.
General Obligation Debt
On June 30, 2016, the City had outstanding approximately $1.27 billion of general obligation longterm bonds, all of which bear fixed rates of interest. On March 1, 2017, the City had approximately $1.21
billion of general obligation long-term bonds outstanding.
The City is authorized to secure any of its general obligation indebtedness by a pledge of all or any
part of any revenues of the City including, without limitation, any tax, such as real property taxes, any fees
payable to or for the account of the City, and certain receipts, distributions and reimbursements held or to
be received by the City from the Commonwealth. The City currently has no general obligation bonds or
notes outstanding secured by such a pledge.
Debt Limits
All debt of the City requires the authorization of the City Council and approval of the Mayor. If the
Mayor vetoes a loan order passed by the City Council, the charter of the City provides that the loan order is
void and may not be passed over the Mayor’s veto. Authorization of bonds under a loan order of the City
Council includes, unless otherwise provided, the authorization to issue temporary notes in anticipation of
such bonds.
The statutory debt limit for the City consists of a debt limit and a double debt limit. The debt limit is
5%, and the double debt limit is 10%, of the valuation of taxable property in the City as last equalized by
the State Department of Revenue. Biennially, prior to January 31st, the Commissioner of Revenue
establishes a final equalized valuation which is the basis for determining the debt limit for the following
two-year period or until another equalization has been established. The equalized valuation of taxable
property in the City established by the Commissioner of Revenue in January 2017 equals $143.58 billion.
Based on the current equalized valuation, the City’s debt limit equals approximately $7.18 billion, and its
double debt limit equals $14.36 billion as of March 1, 2017.
The City may authorize debt up to its debt limit without state approval. The City may authorize debt
over the debt limit up to the double debt limit with the approval of the Municipal Finance Oversight Board,
composed of the State Treasurer and Receiver-General, the State Auditor, the Attorney General and the
Director of Accounts. As of June 30, 2016, the City had outstanding debt of $1.13 billion subject to the
debt limit, and authorized but unissued debt subject to the debt limit of $680.8 million. As of March 1,
2017, the City had outstanding debt of $1.09 billion subject to the debt limit, and authorized but unissued
debt subject to the debt limit of $894.7 million. Based on the City’s current debt limit of $7.18 billion, the
City had the capacity to authorize an additional $5.20 billion of debt as of March 1, 2017.

There are many categories of general obligation debt which are not subject to the debt limit and are
therefore not included in the Debt Incurring Capacity table above. Some such debt is, however, subject to
A-33

other debt limits, dollar limitations or state approval. As of March 1, 2017, the City had a total of $1.21
billion in long-term debt outstanding, of which $121.5 million was exempt from the debt limit. As of that
date the City also had $75.7 million of long-term debt that was authorized but unissued and exempt from
the debt limit.

Short-Term Borrowings
Although the City is authorized to borrow for operating purposes through the issuance of short-term
notes in anticipation of revenue receipts, it has not done so in several years. In addition, the City is
authorized to issue short-term debt obligations or Bond Anticipation Notes (“BANs”) in anticipation of the
issuance of long-term bonds. Currently, no BANs are outstanding.
Special Obligation Debt
In addition to general obligation indebtedness, the Bond Procedure Act of 1983 and various other
special acts authorize the City to incur indebtedness which is secured by and payable solely from certain
revenues of the City which are pledged for the payment of such indebtedness or which are subject to annual
appropriation by the City for such purpose. As of March 1, 2017, the City has no special obligation debt.
Debt of Agencies Related to the City
In addition to general obligation and special obligation indebtedness of the City, the City and certain
agencies related to the City are authorized to issue debt which is solely an obligation of the agency or
which, although issued by the City, are payable solely from revenues derived from projects financed by
such debt. Except as described below, such obligations do not constitute a debt of the City.

A-36

Boston Water and Sewer Commission
The Boston Water and Sewer Commission (“BWSC”) is an independent body politic and corporate
and a political subdivision of the Commonwealth created in July 1977. The BWSC, among its other
powers, is authorized to operate and maintain the water and sewer systems of the City, construct
improvements to the systems, collect user charges for its services, and finance its activities and its
borrowing through its revenues. The City is not obligated on debt issued by the BWSC. The BWSC’s user
charges, as required by statute, are designed to produce revenues to the BWSC sufficient to pay all of its
current operating expenses. These user charges are anticipated to increase moderately. The City’s property
tax base is not used to subsidize water and sewer services.
Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston
The Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston (“EDIC”) is a body politic and
corporate and an instrumentality of the Commonwealth with a board of five members, also appointed as the
members of the Boston Planning & Development Agency (“BPDA”). EDIC has a variety of powers to
assist industrial development projects in the City including the power to issue special obligation revenue
bonds to finance economic development projects in the City, which are solely the obligation of EDIC, or
the owner or lessee of the financed project. The City is also authorized to appropriate or borrow monies in
aid of EDIC development projects within certain urban renewal debt limitations.
Boston Planning & Development Agency
The Boston Redevelopment Authority (“BRA”) d/b/a Boston Planning and Development Agency
(“BPDA”) is a public body politic and corporate constituting the City’s redevelopment authority. It acts as
the City’s planning board and exercises certain powers of the state Department of Housing and Community
Development. The BPDA board consists of four members appointed by the Mayor, subject to confirmation
by the City Council, and one appointed by the state Department of Housing and Community Development.
The staff includes architects, economists, engineers, lawyers and urban planners, as well as management
personnel and administrative support. The BPDA provides the planning support for major construction,
development and redevelopment activity in the City. Although the BPDA is authorized to issue revenue
bonds and notes which would not constitute indebtedness of the City, BPDA projects have traditionally
been financed through a combination of federal and state grants, the proceeds of general obligation bonds
issued by the City and revenues from the lease or sale of land.
Boston Public Health Commission
The Boston Public Health Commission is a body politic and corporate and a political subdivision of
the Commonwealth created in June 1996 as the successor to the City’s Department of Health and Hospitals.
See “The City—Principal Government Services—Public Health.” The BPHC is responsible for the
implementation of public health programs in the City and serves as the board of health of the City. In
addition to its other powers, the BPHC is authorized by its enabling act, with the approval of the City
Council and the Mayor, to borrow money for any of its corporate purposes from the City or from the
Massachusetts Health and Educational Facilities Authority. Debt of the BPHC is not a debt or other
obligation of the City. The BPHC has no debt currently outstanding.
The BPHC is also obligated to reimburse the City for debt service paid on all outstanding general
obligation bonds of the City issued for public health and hospital purposes, which was paid in full in prior
fiscal years. The BPHC has required, and can be expected to continue to require, substantial financial
support from the City to maintain its public health mission and programs, including satisfaction of its
obligations described above.
Other Agencies and Corporations
Two other public bodies are empowered, either by themselves or through the City, to issue special
obligation revenue bonds. The Boston Housing Authority (“BHA”) is responsible for the construction,
financing and operation of residential housing for low-income persons. While the City provides certain
municipal services to BHA developments, and capital expenditures for City infrastructure related to those
developments, the City is not directly or indirectly liable for operating or debt service expenses of the
BHA. The City, acting by and through the Boston Industrial Development Financing Authority, is
authorized to issue revenue bonds to finance the construction of industrial, commercial and pollutioncontrol facilities. The City has also traditionally provided financial assistance to a number of nonprofit
corporations organized to provide and conduct civic and charitable functions for residents and visitors to
the City and to stimulate the economic development of the City.

A-37

In addition, two nonprofit corporations, the Dudley Square Realty Corporation (“DSRC”) and the
Ferdinand Building Development Corporation (“FBDC”), were formed by the City in October 2011 in
order to make the Dudley Municipal Building Project — now named the Bruce C. Bolling Building —
eligible for New Market Tax Credit (“NMTC”) financing. DSRC and FBDC are under the control of the
City. The City’s capital budget and general obligation bond proceeds were the primary project funding
source, but in order to reduce City general obligation funding for the building by approximately $8 million,
all funding flowed through the NMTC financing structure and until the time of retirement of NMTC loans,
ownership of the building is retained by DSRC, with FBDC as sublandlord to the City (for the BPS
occupied space) and to the limited amount of commercially leased space. Lease payments due by the City
for the BPS occupied space flow to DSRC, which utilizes the payments to pay for the project’s NMTC
qualified low-income community investment loans. The annual lease payment is reflected in the City’s
general obligation debt service requirements.
Major Contractual Obligations
In addition to its debt obligations, the City has substantial contractual obligations. Included in this
category are the City’s obligation for pension benefit payments to its contributory retirement system for
City employees and other post-employment benefits which is included in the annual tax levy (see
“Employee Benefits”); agreements for the provision of sanitation, solid waste collection and disposal
services (see “The City—Principal Government Services—Public Works”); and agreements with BMCC
for the provision of operating assistance (see “City Indebtedness—Special Obligation Debt” and “Debt of
Agencies Related to the City—Boston Public Health Commission” above). The City has also executed
several equipment lease agreements in order to finance the acquisition of departmental equipment. As of
March 1, 2017, the amount outstanding under the lease agreements equals $79.6 million. Lease payments
are subject to annual appropriation and are not included in the City’s debt limit.
The City has also entered into three transactions under the Commonwealth’s Infrastructure
Investment Incentive (“I-Cubed”) program. See Note 16 to the City’s audited financial statements for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, which are attached as Exhibit I to this Appendix A, for information
regarding this program and the City’s contingent obligations under it.
Capital Planning and Borrowing Program
Capital Planning Process
The capital planning process coincides with the annual budget cycle and provides an opportunity for
City departments to identify their facility, equipment, infrastructure, technology and planning needs in a
systematic manner and to forward their proposals to the Office of Budget Management (“OBM”) for
funding consideration. The first phase concludes with the release of an updated five-year capital plan
published as part of the City’s annual budget document. The process allows for a continuing reassessment
of capital needs. On April 13, 2016, the Mayor submitted his fiscal 2017 budget to the City Council and
filed $231.4 million in new capital authorizations which were subsequently approved by the City Council.
Capital Funding Plan
The City funds its capital plan primarily through general obligation bonds and external grants. The
City awards construction contracts and incurs capital outlay costs based upon appropriations to be funded
from bond proceeds and grant receipts. In circumstances where project expenditures occur prior to the
receipt of bond proceeds or grant reimbursements, the City temporarily pays such costs from available
funds.
Current Capital Investment Plans
The fiscal 2017-2021 capital plan includes projects that improve the physical condition of schools,
parks, community centers, libraries, public safety facilities, and equipment across the City. Construction of
the new Dearborn STEM Academy will be completed by the end of 2017. Significant investment in the
City’s technology infrastructure and business applications include major upgrades to its human capital
management system and Police Department radio system.
Major investments are planned in the City’s parks system including a $1.9 million restoration of the
Paul Revere Mall in the North End, pathway improvements at Franklin Park totaling $5.0 million, and a
$3.7 million project that will begin the process of revitalizing Harambee Park. The City also expects to
spend $90 million over the next five years renovating or replacing branch libraries.

A-38

The maintenance of roadways and sidewalks remains a focus of the City’s investment plan. In
addition, ongoing investments in accessible pedestrian ramps and signals will make it easier for everyone to
get around. The City continues to make infrastructure investments through its Vision Zero program with
the goal of eliminating fatal and serious traffic crashes by 2030.
In view of the economic and social benefits of consistent, long-range capital planning, the City
remains committed to implementing its capital program.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Retirement Systems
Employees of the City of Boston are not participants in the federal social security system; instead, the
City participates in a contributory defined benefit retirement system that is administered by the Boston
Retirement System (“BRS” or “System”). The BRS is a cost sharing multiple-employer qualified defined
benefit governmental pension plan as defined by federal law and is governed by the provisions of
Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32. The BRS is administered by a five member board: the City
Auditor, who serves ex-officio; two individuals elected by members of the System; an individual chosen by
the Mayor; and an individual chosen by the other four members or appointed by the Mayor if the other four
members do not agree on a selection within 30 days of a vacancy. Retirement payments are issued on a
monthly basis and payments are funded through a combination of mandatory deductions from current
employees, employer contributions, Commonwealth appropriations and investment earnings.
In addition to appropriation payments to cover current and future benefit payments of City employees
covered by the BRS, the City funds noncontributory retirement benefits for pensioners whose employment
predates the BRS, certain veterans who meet certain state law requirements, former employees retired
under Massachusetts Special Acts and families receiving killed-in-the-line-of-duty benefits. As of January
2017, the City is providing such benefits to 67 pensioners; these benefits are funded on a pay-as-you-go
basis with monthly pension payments of approximately $324,000. GASB Statement No. 73, Accounting
and Financial Reporting for Pensions and Related Assets That Are Not Within the Scope of GASB
Statement No. 68, extends the financial reporting requirements in GASB 68 to pension benefits provided
outside a trust or equivalent arrangement. The City expects that these requirements will apply to the City’s
noncontributory pension plan. The City is developing a total pension liability for the plan and will
recognize the liability in the government-wide financial statements for fiscal year 2017.
On December 4, 2008, the City, the BRS, the Public Employee Retirement Administration
Commission (“PERAC”), and the Commonwealth entered into a memorandum of agreement to transfer the
direct responsibility for funding the liability of Boston teachers’ pensions to the Commonwealth effective
fiscal 2010; legislation mirroring this agreement was signed into law on May 22, 2010. Among the
significant transactions which took place shortly after passage of the legislation were: a) the BRS
transferred 27% of the market value of its assets to the Pension Reserve Investment Trust (“PRIT”) Fund as
the portion of the BRS assets related to Boston teacher pension liability according to a valuation accepted
by all parties in the aforementioned memorandum of agreement, and b) the last reimbursement originally
scheduled to go to the City's General Fund, $126.9 million, was directly deposited with the BRS to reduce
the BRS—Excluding Teachers unfunded liability. The BRS continues to administer pension services for all
Boston teacher employees, retirees and beneficiaries. The legislation eliminated the three-party
(BRS/Commonwealth/City of Boston) transaction, based partly on outdated pay-as-you-go methodology,
and replaced it with a more financially sound two party (BRS/Commonwealth) transaction that clarifies
ownership of the liability and is based upon current year, actuarially calculated funding.
Chapter 61 of the Acts of 2009, as amended, transferred approximately 1,000 employees of the
Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department to the Commonwealth effective January 1, 2010. All current and
future Suffolk County Sheriff employees became members of the State Retirement System and are now the
fiscal responsibility of the Commonwealth. Former employees of the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department,
who retired prior to January 1, 2010, remain members of the BRS and their respective pension liability
remains the obligation of the City.
The following table reflects amounts expended or budgeted by the City for pension payments for
fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016. These numbers include contributions for both contributory and noncontributory members. The contributory numbers are primarily driven by amortization of the BRS
unfunded liability, which is on a schedule that targets reducing this liability to zero by fiscal 2025, 15 years
earlier than the statutory deadline at the end of fiscal 2040.

The City’s 2017 budgeted contribution of $199.3 million includes $189.5 million allocable to City
employees, other than teachers, $9.4 million allocable to the Boston Water and Sewer Commission
(BWSC) of which approximately $4.57M will be reimbursed to the City for employee service accrued after
BWSC became an independent commission, and $0.3 million allocable to the Boston Public Health
Commission (BPHC). BPHC’s contribution towards their pension obligation in fiscal 2017 totals $17.9
million. BPHC’s fiscal 2017 pension obligation is paid in large part from BPHC’s fiscal 2017 general fund
appropriation in the amount of $14.3 million while the remainder is funded by grant resources.
The actuarial accrued liability of the BRS exceeds the actuarial value of the assets of the BRS as of

Boston Retirement System.

The most recent actuarial valuation is as of January 1, 2016 and is available at
https://www.boston.gov/departments/retirement. The January 1, 2016 valuation assumes a long-term rate of
return of 7.75% for BRS—Excluding Teachers assets. The long-term rate of return assumption was
lowered from 8.00% to 7.75% beginning with the January 1, 2012 valuation. The actuarial valuation of
assets is determined annually by recognizing 20% of gains or losses, and to the extent necessary, by also
recognizing any additional portion of gains or losses, which keeps the actuarial valuation of assets between
80% and 120% of market value. The net effect is a smoother trend of annual pension funding during
volatile short-term periods of asset gains or losses. The following table shows the market and actuarial
value of the plan’s non-teacher assets.

As of December 31, 2016, the estimated market value of assets not held for teacher benefit payments
was approximately $4.11 billion. This amount is an estimate based upon then current market values of
certain assets held by the BRS and prior period values for certain other assets for which the current market
value is not readily ascertainable. This amount is unaudited and subject to change. It should be noted that
the annual required contribution of the City is based, in part, upon the actuarial value of assets, not market

A-40

values. This is commonly done in computing annual funding requirements in order to prevent extreme
fluctuations that might otherwise arise from temporary or cyclical economic and market conditions.
In accordance with Chapter 68 of the Acts of 2007, the state regulatory agency for pensions, PERAC,
annually reviews investment performance and funded ratio of systems as of January 1st. If a system is: (i)
less than 65% funded, and (ii) has trailed the investment performance of the PRIT fund by 2% or more on
an average annualized basis over the previous ten year period, PERAC will declare the system
underperforming and the system shall transfer its assets to the PRIT fund. For reasons unrelated to Chapter
68, the BRS–Teachers assets are invested in the PRIT fund; the BRS–Excluding Teachers is currently
funded at 74.96% based on the actuarial value of assets.
For additional information concerning a comparison of the market value of assets and investment
return to the actuarial value of assets and investment return for the period 2004 through 2013, see Exhibit G
in Section 4 of the January 1, 2016 actuarial valuation referenced above. The City is currently committed to
a funding schedule for fiscal 2017, and 2018 that is based on the most recent actuarial valuation,
incorporating asset and liability data as of January 1, 2016. The funding schedule is calculated in
accordance with the entry age actuarial cost method and includes paying the current year’s present value of
benefits earned during the year (“normal cost”) and an annual contribution toward eliminating the unfunded
liability of the BRS by 2025, 15 years ahead of the statutory deadline at the end of fiscal 2040.
Many variables are in play with each new valuation, and the actuary’s recommendations and
consultation with the City are part of a careful planning process that precedes the BRS final approval of the
valuation and funding schedule. In the 2016 valuation, salary increase assumptions for the BRS excluding
teachers was lowered by 0.50% for all employee groups, and the mortality tables were adjusted to better
reflect longer life expectancies. Beginning in 2012, the BRS lowered the investment long-term rate of
return assumption from 8.0% to 7.75%. In the 2012 valuation, assumptions were adjusted to reflect an
increase to the retiree Cost of Living Adjustment (“COLA”) base from $12,000 to $13,000 as of July 1,
2012 and an increase to the minimum annual pension allowance from $3,000 to $6,000 effective Dec. 21,
2012. The funding schedule also assumes a similar COLA will be approved in future years. Additional
adjustments were made for the 2012 valuation to increase the assumed rates of disability by 25% for public
safety officers and to decrease the assumed rates of disability by 50% for non-public safety officers; these
changes to the assumed rates of disability better reflect past experience and future expectations.
The City currently expects to fully amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability by June 30, 2025.
Chart 2-17 of the January 1, 2016 actuarial valuation sets forth the aggregate funding schedule from 2017
through 2025 for the BRS, excluding teachers. The City’s contributions for the amortization of the
unfunded liability are estimated to increase from $199.3 million in fiscal 2017 to $420.5 million in fiscal
2025. The City’s total employer contributions each year will also include the normal costs for each year.
This schedule is illustrative only of the currently expected funding schedule. The actual funding schedule
will be different due to the actual circumstances that will occur and that will likely vary from the
assumptions used in the January 1, 2016 valuation. In particular, the actual rate of return on assets for the
year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 0.15% and the currently estimated rate of return for the year
ended December 31, 2016,approximately 7.1%, were below the assumed rate of return currently in effect
and this will cause a significant increase in the total annual contribution necessary to amortize fully the
unfunded actuarial accrued liability by June 30, 2025, absent other offsetting factors. The City believes that
its current pension funding schedule, with its conservative salary growth assumptions, is sufficient to
absorb the long term impacts of collective bargaining awards. The funding schedule assumes a 4.0% salary
growth assumption for general service employees, a 4.25% salary growth assumption for certain employees
with hazardous occupations, and a 4.50% salary growth assumption for public safety officers. The City’s
pension liability is reevaluated every two years and adjustments are made to the funding schedule, as
needed.
In June 2012, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) issued GASB Statement No.
68, which sets forth new standards that modifies the accounting and financial reporting of the City’s
pension obligations. The new standard for governments that provide employee pension benefits requires the
City to report in its statement of net position a net pension liability (“NPL”), defined as the difference
between the total pension liability (the present value of projected benefit payments to employees based on
their past service) and the fiduciary net position of the Plan determined based on U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles set aside in a trust and restricted to paying benefits to current employees, retirees and
their beneficiaries. The rate used to discount projected benefit payments to their present value is based on a
single rate that reflects (a) the long-term expected rate of return on plan investments as long as the plan net
position is projected under specified conditions to be sufficient to pay pensions of current employees and
retirees and the pension plan assets are expected to be invested using a strategy to achieve that return and

A-41

(b) a yield or index rate based on tax-exempt 20-year AA or higher rated municipal bonds to the extent that
the conditions for use of the long-term expected rate of return are not met. The date after which a yield or
index rate on tax-exempt 20-year AA-or-higher rated municipal bonds is required to be used is referred to
as a “crossover date.”
The new GASB 68 standard was effective commencing with the City’s fiscal 2015. The Total
Pension Liability (“TPL”) and plan’s fiduciary net position as of December 31, 2015 for the BRS,
including teachers were approximately $9.97 billion and $5.56 billion, respectively, which results in a Net
Pension Liability (“NPL”) of approximately $4.41 billion as of December 31, 2015, as compared to an NPL
of $3.85 billion as of December 31, 2014. The portion of the BRS NPL allocable to the City reported at
June 30, 2016 is approximately $1.62 billion, which amount includes the NPL associated with City
employees, excluding teachers, and certain retirees of the Suffolk County Sherriff Department. The BRS
did not experience a “crossover date” in connection with determination of the NPL and accordingly, the
measurement of the City’s NPL for fiscal 2016 assumes a 7.75% discount rate which is the same as the
expected rate of return of Plan investments for the BRS, excluding teachers. The annual money-weighted
rate of return, net of investment expense for the BRS for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 0.15%.
The comparable rate of return for the year ended December 31, 2016 is not yet available, but the BRS
expects it to be approximately 6.5%.
Implementation of GASB 68 also requires setting forth the sensitivity of the City’s net pension
liability using an assumed discount rate that is one percentage point lower and one percentage point higher
than the current rate. A 1% decrease would increase the City’s net pension liability to approximately $2.19
billion and a 1% increase would lower it to approximately $1.15 billion.
As a result of the implementation of GASB 68, the net position of the governmental activities as of
July 1, 2014 was restated by -$1.31 billion, which resulted in a net deficit position as of June 30, 2014 of $708.3 million, as compared to a previously determined net surplus position as of June 30, 2014 of $603.1
million.
While GASB 68 changes the way state and local governments report pension benefits in their
financial statements it does not impact pension funding requirements or contribution amounts. To date, the
City has contributed to the BRS 100% of the amounts required to be so contributed, as determined in
accordance with actuarial valuations and a funding schedule established pursuant to state law, which are
approved by PERAC, and the City expects to continue to do so. As noted above, the City currently intends
to fully fund its unfunded actuarial accrued liability by June 30, 2025.
In connection with the implementation of GASB 68, the BRS prepared a document called “Schedules
of Employer Allocations and Pension Amounts by Employers”, which were audited by Ernst & Young
LLP, independent auditors for the BRS. These schedules are based on financial information pertaining to
the BRS as of December 31, 2015.
The schedules are available at https://www.boston.gov/departments/retirement , along with the most
recent actuarial valuation reports and audited financial statements of the BRS. See also Note 11 to the
City’s fiscal 2016 audited financial statements attached hereto as Exhibit I.
Other Postemployment Benefits
In addition to the pension benefits described above, the City provides postemployment health care
and life insurance benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis to approximately 14,900 City (including teachers) and
Boston Public Health Commission participating retirees and their beneficiaries.
GASB Statement No. 43, Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefit Plans Other Than Pension
Plans, and GASB Statement No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for
Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions, became effective June 30, 2007, and June 30, 2008,
respectively. These statements require the City to account for and report the value of its future Other Post
Employment Benefit (“OPEB”) obligations.
In compliance with these reporting requirements, the City obtains an independent actuarial valuation
which is prepared every other fiscal year. In fiscal 2008, the City began voluntary annual appropriations to
reduce its OPEB liability. Aggregate City appropriations since that time through fiscal 2016 total $295
million. The City appropriated an additional $40 million in fiscal 2017. Annual appropriations are retained
in an irrevocable trust fund, which is authorized through the City’s acceptance of M.G.L. Chapter 32B
section 20, and is established under a trust agreement between the City and the City’s Collector-Treasurer
as trustee and custodian. A separate OPEB trust fund has also been established by the BPHC and $11.5
million has been deposited through fiscal 2016. The BPHC deposited an additional $2.25 million in fiscal
2017. The City has procured investment consulting services in order to optimize investment of the OPEB

A-42

Trust Funds. The aggregate amount on deposit in the OPEB Trust Funds as of December 31, 2016 was
$437 million.
The most recent independent actuarial valuation of the City’s OPEB obligations at June 30, 2015,
estimated that the total OPEB unfunded actuarial accrued liability (“UAAL”) of the City and the BPHC as
of that date on account of then current retirees, beneficiaries, dependents and current active members was
approximately $2.26 billion, based on current funding polices. This represents an increase of $121 million
or 6% from the June 30, 2013 valuation. Of this amount, approximately $2.16 billion is allocable to the
City (including teachers) and $97.6 million is allocable to the BPHC.
The increase in the UAAL was due to the net effect of a number of

If the City and the BPHC were to fund the annual required contribution rather than the pay-as-you-go
amounts described in the next paragraph, the required funding for fiscal 2017 would be $178.4 million, of
which $72.2 million represents the normal cost and $106.2 million represents amortization of the unfunded
actuarial accrued liability.
The most recent valuation projects that the City and the BPHC (the funding for which is appropriated
by the City to the BPHC as part of its overall departmental budget) will pay benefits (net of retiree
contributions) on behalf of current retired employees of approximately $121.5 million in fiscal 2017, on a
pay-as-you-go basis (as compared to $112.2 million in fiscal 2016). Along with the previously mentioned
additional appropriation to the trust funds mentioned above from both the City and the BPHC totaling
$42.25 million in fiscal 2017, the City and the BPHC are projected to fund 92% of the annual required
contribution in fiscal 2017.
The June 30, 2015 actuarial valuation projects pay-as-you-go benefit payments to increase to
approximately $481.2 million in fiscal 2043, as compared to an annual required contribution of $290.7
million in fiscal 2043, assuming an annual additional appropriation of $40 million through fiscal 2025 and
$100 million annually thereafter from the City, and an annual amount from the BPHC of $2.25 million
through 2043. When the obligations are fully funded, the City expects to continue to fund the normal cost
into the trust fund and pay the projected benefits (net retiree contributions) on behalf of current retired
employees from the trust fund. This is illustrative only of the currently expected funding schedule. The
actual funding schedule will be different due to the actual circumstances that will occur and that will likely
vary from the assumptions used in the June 30, 2015 valuation.
In June 2015, the GASB issued Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for
Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions. The objective of this Statement is to improve accounting
and financial reporting by state and local governments for postemployment benefits other than pensions
(OPEB). It also improves information provided by state and local governmental employers about financial
support for OPEB that is provided by other entities to the extent applicable. This Statement is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2017. In February 2016, the City began to take steps to review this
standard and work with Segal Consulting (City’s OPEB actuary) to develop a plan to provide the necessary
information in a timely manner to the City and to discuss what changes are expected for the June 30, 2017
valuation. The City will also begin to evaluate the effect on its financial statements and begin educating
significant stakeholders within the organization on these changes. Thus, the City will be positioned to meet
the required reporting for fiscal year 2018.
Additional information regarding the City’s OPEB obligations may be found in the “Actuarial
Valuation & Review of Other Post Employment Benefits (“OPEB”) as of June 30, 2015,” available at
https://www.boston.gov/departments/auditing and Note 12 to the City’s fiscal 2016 audited financial
statement attached hereto as Exhibit I.

KPMG LLP

Boston, MA 02111

Independent Auditors’ Report
To the Honorable Mayor and City Council
City of Boston, Massachusetts:
Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the aggregate discretely
presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the City of
Boston, Massachusetts (the City), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016, and the related notes to the
financial statements, which collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of
contents.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We did not audit the
financial statements of the Dudley Square Realty Corporation, the Ferdinand Building Development
Corporation, and the Permanent Funds, which represent 5.4% and 0.2% of the assets and revenues,
respectively, of the governmental activities, and 1.3% and 0.7% of the assets and revenues, respectively, of the
aggregate remaining fund information. We also did not audit the financial statements of the Boston Retirement
System, the OPEB Trust Fund and the Private-Purpose Trust Funds, which represent 97.3% and 66.4% of the
assets and revenues, respectively, of the aggregate remaining fund information. Further, we did not audit the
financial statements of the Boston Public Health Commission, Trustees of the Public Library of the City of
Boston and the Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston, which represent 57.3% and
90.1% of the assets and revenues, respectively, of the aggregate discretely presented component units. Those
financial statements were audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinions,
insofar as they relate to the amounts included for those entities, is based solely on the reports of the other
auditors. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued
by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of
the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we
express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

A‐2• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinions.
Opinions
In our opinion, based on our audit and the reports of the other auditors, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, the
aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund
information of the City, as of June 30, 2016, and the respective changes in financial position, and where
applicable, cash flows thereof and the budgetary comparison for the City’s General Fund for the year then
ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Emphasis of Matters
Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement
As discussed in Note 2n to the financial statements, in 2016, the City adopted Governmental Accounting
Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurement and Application. Our opinions are not
modified with respect to this matter.
Other Matters
Prior-Year Comparative Information
The financial statements include partial prior-year comparative information related to the budgetary comparison
for the City’s General Fund. Such information does not include all of the information required for a presentation
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, such information should be read
in conjunction with the City’s financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2015, from which such partial
information was derived.
Required Supplementary Information
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that the management’s discussion and analysis
and the schedules listed under Required Supplementary Information in the table of contents, be
presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the
basic financial statements, is required by the GASB who considers it to be an essential part of financial
reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical
context. We and the other auditors have applied certain limited procedures to the required
supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the
information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our
inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic
financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because
the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any
assurance.

Independent Auditors’ Report •A‐3

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated December 29, 2016
on our consideration of the City’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with
certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that
report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or on compliance.
That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in
considering the City’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
(Unaudited)
The City of Boston (the City) provides this Management’s Discussion and Analysis to present additional information to
the readers of the City’s basic financial statements. This narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of
the City is for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Readers are encouraged to consider this information in
conjunction with the additional information that is furnished in the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
(CAFR).

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the City’s financial statements. The City’s basic
financial statements include three components: 1) Government‐wide Financial Statements, 2) Fund Financial
Statements, and 3) Notes to the Financial Statements. This report also contains required supplementary information
regarding historical pension information and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plan information. The components
of the financial statements are described in the following sections.
Basic Financial Statements
The basic financial statements include two types of financial statements that present different views of the City – the
Government‐wide Financial Statements and the Fund Financial Statements. The Notes to the Basic Financial
Statements supplement the financial statement information and clarify line items that are part of the financial
statements.
Government‐wide Financial Statements
The Government‐wide Financial Statements provide a broad view of the City’s operations in a manner similar to a
private sector business. The statements provide both short‐term and long‐term information about the City’s financial
position, which assists in assessing the City’s economic condition at the end of the fiscal year. These are prepared using
the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. This basically means they follow
methods that are similar to those used by most businesses. They take into account all revenues and expenses
connected with the fiscal year even if cash involved has not been received or paid. The Government‐wide Financial
Statements include two statements:
The Statement of Net Position presents all of the government’s assets and deferred outflows of resources and
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between them reported as net position. Over time,
increases or decreases in the City’s net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the
City is improving or deteriorating.
The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the government’s net position changed during the
most recent fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the
change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this
statement for some items that will not result in cash flows until future fiscal periods (such as uncollected taxes and
earned but unused vacation leave). This statement also presents a comparison between direct expenses and
program revenues for each function of the City.
Both the above financial statements present two separate sections as described below.
Governmental Activities – The activities in this section are mostly supported by taxes and intergovernmental
revenues (federal and state grants). Most services normally associated with city government fall into this category,
including general government, human services, public safety, public works, property and development, parks and
recreation, library, schools, public health programs, state and district assessments, and debt service.

Management’s Discussion & Analysis•A‐5

Discretely Presented Component Units – These are legally separate entities for which the City has financial
accountability but function independent of the City. For the most part, these entities operate similar to private
sector businesses. The City’s four discretely presented component units are the Boston Public Health Commission,
the Boston Development & Planning Agency, the Economic Development Industrial Corporation, and the Trustees
of the Boston Public Library.
Complete financial statements of the individual component units can be obtained from their respective
administrative offices. Additional information about the City’s component units is presented in the Notes to the
Financial Statements.
The Government‐wide Financial Statements can be found immediately following this discussion and analysis.
Fund Financial Statements
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated
for specific activities or objectives. The City, like other local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and
demonstrate compliance with finance‐related legal requirements.
The Fund Financial Statements focus on individual parts of the City government, reporting the City’s operations in
more detail than the Government‐wide Financial Statements. All of the funds of the City can be divided into three
categories. It is important to note that these fund categories use different accounting approaches and should be
interpreted differently. The three categories of funds are:
Governmental Funds – Most of the basic services provided by the City are financed through governmental funds.
Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in
the Government‐wide Financial Statements. However, unlike the Government‐wide Financial Statements, the
Governmental Fund Financial Statements focus on near term inflows and outflows of spendable resources. They also
focus on the balances of spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in
evaluating the government’s near term financing requirements. This approach is known as using the flow of current
financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this approach, revenues
are recorded when cash is received or when susceptible to accrual (i.e., measurable and available to liquidate
liabilities of the current period). Expenditures are generally recorded when liabilities are incurred, except for those
related to long‐term liabilities, which are recorded when due and payable. These statements provide a detailed short
term view of the City’s finances to assist in determining whether there will be adequate financial resources available to
meet the current needs of the City.
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the Government‐wide Financial Statements, it is
useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for
governmental activities in the Government‐wide Financial Statements. By doing so, readers may better understand the
long term impact of the government’s near term financing decisions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and
the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation
to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and the governmental activities. These reconciliations are
presented on the page immediately following each governmental fund financial statement.
The City presents four columns in the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of
revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances. The City’s three major governmental funds are the General
Fund, the Special Revenue Fund, and the Capital Projects Fund. All non‐major governmental funds are combined in the
“Other Governmental Funds” column on these statements. The Governmental Fund Financial Statements can be found
immediately following the Government‐wide Financial Statements.

A‐6• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements
Of the City’s governmental funds, the General Fund is the only fund for which a budget is legally adopted. The
Statement of Revenues and Expenditures – Budgetary Basis is presented after the governmental fund financial
statements. This statement provides a comparison of the General Fund original and final budget and the actual
expenditures for the current and prior year on a budgetary basis.
In accordance with state law and regulations, the City’s legally adopted General Fund budget is prepared on a
“budgetary” basis instead of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Among the key differences
between these two sets of accounting principles are that “budgetary” records property tax as it is levied, while GAAP
records it as it becomes susceptible to accrual, “budgetary” records certain activities and transactions in the General
Fund that GAAP records in separate funds, and “budgetary” records any amount raised to cover a prior year deficit as
an expenditure and any available funds raised from prior year surpluses as a revenue, while GAAP ignores these
impacts from prior years. The difference in accounting principles inevitably leads to varying results in excess or
deficiency of revenues over expenditures. Additional information and a reconciliation of “budgetary” to GAAP
statements is provided in note 4 to the Financial Statements.
Proprietary Funds – These funds are used to show activities that operate more like those of commercial enterprises.
Like the Government‐wide Financial Statements, Proprietary Fund Financial Statements use the economic resources
measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting. There are two types of proprietary funds – enterprise funds and
internal service funds. Enterprise funds charge fees for services provided to outside customers including local
governments. Enterprise Funds provide the same type of information as the business‐type activities of the
Government‐wide Financial Statements within governmental activities, only in more detail. Currently, the City does
not have any enterprise funds. The Internal Service Fund provides health insurance services predominantly to other
funds, departments or agencies of the City. Therefore, its activities are included in the Government‐wide financial
statements within governmental activities.
The Proprietary Funds Financial Statements can be found immediately following the Governmental Fund Financial
Statements.
Fiduciary Funds – These funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the City
government. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the Government‐wide Financial Statements because the resources
of these funds are not available to support the City’s own programs. The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much
like that used for proprietary funds. They use the economic resources measurement focus and accrual basis of
accounting.
The City’s fiduciary funds are the Employee Retirement Fund (the Boston Retirement System), which accounts for
the transactions, assets, liabilities, and net position of the City employees’ pension plan; the OPEB Trust Fund, which
is an irrevocable trust established for the accumulation of assets to reduce the unfunded actuarial liability associated
with the City’s obligation for other postemployment benefits; and the Private Purpose Trust and Agency Funds, which
include money held and administered by the City on behalf of third parties.
The Fiduciary Funds Financial Statements can be found immediately following the Proprietary Fund Financial
Statements.
Notes to the Financial Statements
The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the
Government‐wide and the Fund Financial Statements. The Notes to the Financial Statements can be found
immediately following the Fiduciary Funds Financial Statements.

Management’s Discussion & Analysis•A‐7

Required Supplementary Information
The basic financial statements are followed by a section of required supplementary information, which includes a
schedule of funding progress and a schedule of employer contributions for the OPEB Trust Fund, a schedule of the City’s
proportionate share of the net pension liability of the Boston Retirement System, and a schedule of the City’s
contributions to the Boston Retirement System.

CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL IMPACTS
The City of Boston’s OPEB obligation significantly impacts the Government‐wide financial results. Each year,
the City is required to recognize an additional portion of its unfunded actuarial accrued liability. The most
recent valuation of the City’s OPEB obligations as of June 30, 2015, estimated that the total OPEB unfunded
actuarial accrued liability of the City increased by $111.8 million to $2.16 billion. This increase was largely as
a result of changes to the discount rate applied in the actuarial valuation.
In fiscal year 2016, the City’s contribution to the OPEB Trust Fund ($150.3 million) for retiree health benefits
includes $40.0 million in advance funding toward reducing the unfunded actuarial accrued liability. The ARC
was not met in 2016 resulting in an increase in the net OPEB obligation. In fiscal year 2017, the City has also
appropriated $40.0 million in advance funding toward reducing the unfunded actuarial accrued liability.
The City of Boston’s net pension liability significantly impacts the Government‐wide financial results. With
the implementation of GASB Statement No. 68 in fiscal year 2015, the City is required to report its
proportionate share of the Boston Retirement System's collective net pension liability, deferred outflows of
resources, deferred inflows of resources, and pension expense. Based on the measurement of the Boston
Retirement System's net pension liability as of December 31, 2015, the City's proportionate share of that net
pension liability increased by $205.0 million to $1.62 billion.

GOVERNMENT‐WIDE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
This analysis is based on the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities found directly after
Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
Government‐wide Highlights
Net Position – Primary Government – The total liabilities and deferred inflows of resources of the City exceeded its
assets and deferred outflows of resources at fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 by $(549.0) million (presented as net
position). At year end, the City had a deficit in governmental activities unrestricted net position in the amount of
$(1.16) billion.
Changes in Net Position – Primary Government – The City’s total net position increased by $81.6 million from the
amount reported in fiscal year 2015.
Net Position
As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government’s financial position. The City’s
net deficit totaled $(549.0) million at the end of 2016, compared to a net deficit of $(630.6) million reported at the
end of the previous year.
The components of net position comprise the following: the investment in capital assets such as land, buildings,
equipment, and infrastructure (road, bridges, and other immovable assets), less any related debt used to acquire those
assets that are still outstanding – this amount is $557.1 million indicating that the net book value of the City’s capital
assets exceeds the amount of related capital debt outstanding. The City uses these capital assets to provide services to
citizens; consequentially, these assets are not available for future spending. Although the City’s investment in its
capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must

A‐8• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements
be provided from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.
A portion of the City’s governmental activities net position, $53.2 million, represents restricted net position, or
resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used. Internally imposed designations of
resources are not presented as restricted net assets. Unrestricted net position increased $25.7 million from 2015.

Governmental Activities
The City’s governmental activities net position increased by $81.6 million over the prior fiscal year. The following net
changes occurred during the course of operations in fiscal year 2016. In the assets accounts, cash and investments
increased by $80.2 million, receivables decreased by $1.9 million, and capital assets increased by $123.1 million. In the
liability accounts, there was a decrease in warrants and accounts payable of $14.9 million and a decrease in accrued
liabilities of $966 thousand. Additionally, an increase of $27.8 million was recorded relative to the City’s other
postemployment benefit obligation and an increase of $205.0 million was recorded relative to the City's net pension
liability in 2016.
During fiscal year 2016, the City’s revenues increased by 5.0%. The City’s largest sources of revenues were property
taxes, excise taxes, and payment in lieu of taxes of $2.28 billion (65.3% of total revenues) and $988.9 million of program
revenues (28.3% of total revenues). Taxes increased by $99.6 million from the previous year. Program revenues
increased by $55.7 million for fiscal year 2016. This is largely due to increases in operating grants and contributions.
The City’s expenses cover a range of services. The largest expenses were for schools ($1.80 billion), public safety ($941.3
million), public works ($139.8 million), property and development ($118.6 million), general government ($128.3
million), public health programs ($96.1 million), and human services ($52.1 million). In 2016, governmental activities
expenses exceeded program revenues (i.e., user charges, operating grants, and capital grants) by $2.42 billion. This
shortfall was covered primarily through taxes ($2.28 billion) and unrestricted grants and contributions ($199.8 million).
Comparative data on these revenues and expenses is itemized in the reporting of the Changes in Net Position –
Primary Government earlier in this Management Discussion and Analysis.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE CITY’S FUND STATEMENTS
This analysis is based on the Governmental and Proprietary Fund Financial Statements. As noted earlier, the City uses
fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance related legal requirements.
Fund Highlights
Governmental Funds – Fund Balances – as of the close of fiscal year 2016, the City’s governmental funds reported a
combined ending fund balance of $1.36 billion, an increase of $139.0 million from the prior year. Of this total amount,
$682.8 million represents the unassigned fund balance. The increase in fund balance is largely due to an increase in
property and excise taxes.
Governmental Funds
The focus of the City’s governmental funds is to provide information on near term inflows, outflows, and balances
of spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the City’s financial requirements. In particular,
unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government’s financial position at the end of the fiscal
year.
General Fund – Fund Balance – The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the City. The City’s General Fund –
Fund Balance Policy states in part to maintain a GAAP unassigned fund balance in the General Fund that is 15%, or
higher, of GAAP General Fund operating expenditures for the fiscal year. The GAAP unassigned fund balance at the end
of fiscal year 2016 was $682.8 million, which represents approximately 23.0% of GAAP General Fund operating
expenditures.
However, because the City is required to follow the statutory basis of accounting rather than GAAP for determining
the amount of unassigned fund balance that can be appropriated, it is the statutory (not the GAAP) fund balance that
is used to calculate “free cash.” Free cash is the amount of statutory fund balance in the General Fund, as certified
by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ Department of Revenue, which is available for appropriation and is
generated when actual revenues, on a cash basis, exceed budgeted amounts and encumbrances are less than
appropriations, or both.

Management’s Discussion & Analysis •A‐13

The City has established the General Fund‐Fund Balance Policy to ensure that the City maintains adequate levels of
fund balance to mitigate current and future risks (i.e., revenue shortfalls and unanticipated expenditures). The policy in
full states that the City shall maintain a GAAP Unassigned Fund Balance in the General Fund that is 15% or higher
than the current fiscal year’s GAAP General Fund Operating Expenditures. The City shall only consider the certification
of Free Cash (as defined by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ Department of Revenue) in years where the
appropriation of Free Cash shall not cause the fiscal year’s GAAP Unassigned Fund Balance to go below 15% of the
fiscal year’s GAAP General Fund Operating Expenditures, while maintaining a Budgetary Unassigned Fund Balance at
10% or higher of Budgetary Operating Expenditures. The City shall only consider the appropriation of Certified Free
Cash to offset: (1) certain fixed costs such as pension contributions and related post‐retirement health benefits;
and/or (2) to fund extraordinary and non‐recurring events as determined and certified by the City Auditor.
Special Revenue Fund – Fund Balance – The Special Revenue Fund accounts for the proceeds of specific revenue
sources that are restricted or committed to expenditures for predefined purposes. The fiscal year 2016 Special Revenue
Fund balance is reported at $246.7 million, a $38.0 million increase from fiscal year 2015.
Capital Projects Fund – Fund Balance – The Capital Projects Fund accounts for financial resources to be used for
the acquisition or construction of major capital facilities, other than those financed by proprietary funds and trust
funds. The fiscal year 2016 Capital Projects Fund balance is $79.0 million, a $14.3 million increase from fiscal year
2015.
Other Governmental Funds – Fund Balance – Other Governmental Funds account for assets held by the City in
permanent trust funds, as well as the activities related to DSRC and FBDC. The fiscal year 2016 Other Governmental
Funds fund balance is $87.2 million, a $0.2 million decrease from fiscal year 2015.
Internal Service Fund
The City’s Internal Service Fund accounts for the City’s self‐insurance program for health benefits provided by Blue
Cross Blue Shield and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care for City employees, their dependents, and retirees. The Internal
Service Fund is included as part of the governmental activities in the government‐wide financial statements.
Budgetary Highlights
General Fund budgetary highlights include ending fiscal year 2016 with a $1.9 million surplus. There were no material
variances between the original budget and final budget amounts. Significant unfavorable variances from the final
budget to actual results were in the areas of public safety and judgments. Public safety saw an unfavorable variance of
$19.5 million due to a continued high use of overtime in the Police Department and the Fire Department. Also,
judgment and claims saw an unfavorable variance of $7.0 million in court judgments.
Favorable results were reported for General Fund revenue sources, including $29.9 million in excises predominantly in
motor vehicle and room occupancy excise taxes, $22.2 million in payments in lieu of taxes, $22.1 million in licenses
and permits, $12.2 million in departmental and other revenue. Other available funds shows a revenue deficit of $61.5
million, however,this is a result of not transferring $950 thousand of cemetery funds, $20.5 million of parking meter
funds and $40.0 million of free cash from the general fund.

A‐14• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

CAPITAL ASSETS AND LONG‐TERM OBLIGATIONS
Capital Assets
The City’s investment in capital assets for its governmental activities, as of June 30, 2016, has a net book value of
$1.98 billion, made up of costs totaling $3.83 billion less accumulated depreciation of $1.85 billion. This investment
in capital assets includes land, buildings, improvements, equipment, infrastructure, and construction in progress.
Infrastructure assets are items that are normally immovable and have value only to the City, such as roads, bridges,
streets, sidewalks, drainage systems, lighting systems, and similar items.
The total increase in the City’s investment in capital assets for the current fiscal year was approximately $123.1 million
in terms of net book value. However, actual expenditures to purchase or construct capital assets and contributions of
capital assets were $238.4 million for the fiscal year. Most of this amount was used for the purpose of constructing or
reconstructing buildings and building improvements and infrastructure. Depreciation charges for the year totaled $115.4
million. Additional information on the City’s capital assets can be found in note 8 to the Financial Statements.
Long Term Obligations
Debt Administration – The authority of the City to incur debt is governed by federal and state laws that restrict the
amounts and purposes for which a municipality can incur debt. At year end, the City had $1.25 billion in General
Obligations Bonds principal outstanding – an increase of $29.1 million over last year.
There was one bond issuance that took place in fiscal year 2016. The March 24, 2016 $140.0 million Series A general
obligation bond issuance used to finance various capital projects in the City, along with $8.1 million Series B that were
issued for the purpose of advance refunding prior debt in March 2016. In conjunction with the City’s annual bond
offering, the rating service bureau Moody’s Investors Service reaffirmed the City’s bond ratings at Aaa and the rating
service bureau Standard & Poor’s increased the bond rating to AAA. General Obligation Bonds are backed by the full
faith and credit of the City, including the City’s power to levy additional taxes to ensure repayment of debt. Accordingly,
all general obligation debt currently outstanding has been approved by a vote of the City Council.
Notes and Leases Payable and Other Long Term Obligations – The City’s general long term notes and leases and other
long term obligations increased $265.3 million, or 10.14%, during the current fiscal year. Key factors for this increase
are an increase in the net pension liability of $205.0 million, an increase in the workers’ compensation liability of $9.7
million, and the increase in the net OPEB obligation of $27.8 million.
Additional information on the City’s long term debt obligations can be found in note 10 to the Financial Statements.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The GASB has issued Statement No. 72, "Fair Value Measurement and Application." The objective of this Statement
is to address accounting and financial reporting issues related to fair value measurements. This Statement provides
guidance for determining a fair value measurement for financial reporting purposes. This Statement also provides
guidance for applying fair value to certain investments and disclosures related to all fair value measurements. The
requirements of this Statement are effective for financial statements for periods beginning after June 15, 2015.
The GASB has issued Statement No. 76, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for State and
Local Governments,” The objective of this Statement is to identify—in the context of the current governmental financial
reporting environment—the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The requirements in this
Statement improve financial reporting by (1) raising the category of GASB Implementation Guides in the GAAP hierarchy,
thus providing the opportunity for broader public input on implementation guidance; (2) emphasizing the
importance of analogies to authoritative literature when the accounting treatment for an event is not specified in
authoritative GAAP; and (3) requiring the consideration of consistency with the GASB Concepts Statements when

Management’s Discussion & Analysis •A‐15

evaluating accounting treatments specified in non‐authoritative literature. The requirements of this Statement are
effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2015.
The GASB has issued GASB Statement No. 79, "Certain External Investment Pools and Pool Participants." The objective
of this Statement is to address accounting and financial reporting for certain external investment pools and pool
participants. Specifically, it establishes criteria for an external investment pool to qualify for making the election to
measure all of its investments at amortized cost for financial reporting purposes. An external investment pool
qualifies for that reporting if it meets all of the applicable criteria established in this Statement. The specific criteria
address (1) how the external investment pool transacts with participants; (2) requirements for portfolio maturity,
quality, diversification, and liquidity; and (3) calculation and requirements of a shadow price. The requirements of
this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2015, except for certain provisions on
portfolio quality, custodial credit risk, and shadow pricing. Those provisions are effective for reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2015.
The GASB has issued GASB Statement No. 82, "Pension Issues—an amendment of GASB Statements No. 67, No. 68, and
No. 73." The objective of this Statement is to address certain issues that have been raised with respect to
Statements No. 67, "Financial Reporting for Pension Plans", No. 68, "Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions",
and No. 73, "Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions and Related Assets That Are Not within the Scope of
GASB Statement 68, and Amendments to Certain Provisions of GASB Statements 67 and 68". Specifically, this
Statement addresses issues regarding (1) the presentation of payroll‐related measures in required supplementary
information, (2) the selection of assumptions and the treatment of deviations from the guidance in an Actuarial
Standard of Practice for financial reporting purposes, and (3) the classification of payments made by employers to
satisfy employee (plan member) contribution requirements.

FUTURE PRONOUNCEMENTS
The GASB has issued Statement No. 73, "Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions and Related Assets That Are
Not within the Scope of GASB Statement 68, and Amendments to Certain Provisions of GASB Statements 67 and 68." The
objective of this Statement is to improve the usefulness of information about pensions included in the general
purpose external financial reports of state and local governments for making decisions and assessing accountability. This
Statement establishes requirements for defined benefit pensions that are not within the scope of Statement No. 68,
"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions," as well as for the assets accumulated for purposes of providing
those pensions. It also makes amendments to certain provisions of Statements No. 67 and No. 68. The requirements
of this Statement for pension plans that are within the scope of Statement No. 67 or for pensions that are within the
scope of Statement No. 68 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2015. The requirements for defined
benefit pensions not within the scope of Statement No. 68 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2016.
Earlier application is encouraged.
The GASB has issued Statement No. 74, "Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefit Plans Other Than Pension
Plans." The objective of this Statement is to improve the usefulness of information about postemployment benefits
other than pensions (other postemployment benefits or OPEB) included in the general purpose external financial
reports of state and local governmental OPEB plans for making decisions and assessing accountability. This Statement
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2016.
The GASB has issued Statement No. 75, "Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other
Than Pensions.” The primary objective of this Statement is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state
and local governments for OPEB. It also improves information provided by state and local governmental employers
about financial support for OPEB that is provided by other entities. This Statement replaces the requirements of

A‐16• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements
Statements No. 45, "Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other Than
Pensions, as amended, " and No. 57, "OPEB Measurements by Agent Employers and Agent Multiple‐Employer Plans, for
OPEB." This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2017.
The GASB has issued Statement No. 77, “Tax Abatement Disclosures.” The objective of this Statement is to improve
financial reporting by giving users of financial statements essential information that is not consistently or
comprehensively reported to the public at present related to tax abatements. Disclosure of information about the
nature and magnitude of tax abatements will make these transactions more transparent to financial statement users.
As a result, users will be better equipped to understand (1) how tax abatements affect a government’s future ability to
raise resources and meet its financial obligations and (2) the impact those abatements have on a government’s
financial position and economic condition. The requirements of this Statement are effective for financial statements
for periods beginning after December 15, 2015.

(Amounts in thousands)

Net change in fund balances ‐ total governmental funds.....................................................................................................

$

138,989

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of activities are different because:
Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures In the statement of activities, the cost of
those assets is depreciated over their estimated useful lives Capital outlays and contributions of
capital assets ($238,555 ) exceeded depreciation expense ($115,396 ) and loss on disposals ($14).................................

123,145

Certain revenues in the statement of activities that are not reported as revenues in the
governmental funds as they are not considered available.................................................................................................

(21,091)

Issuances of long‐term debt ($173,899) and notes ($15,365) increase long‐term liabilities in the
statement of net position, but are included in the operating statement of the governmental funds
Repayment of bond, note, and lease principal ($131,891) and payments to the escrow agent for
par value of refunded bonds ($9,220) are expenditures in the governmental funds, but reduce
long‐term liabilities in the statement of net position This is the amount by which issuances exceed
repayments and escrow payments.....................................................................................................................................

(48,153)

Increases in bond premiums net ($11,374) increase the long‐term liabilities in the statement of net
position, but are included in the operating statement of the governmental funds Decreases in
deferred loss on refunding, net ($2,005) decrease deferred outflows, net on the statement of net
position, but are included in the operating statement of governmental funds..................................................................

(13,379)

Some expenses reported in the statement of activities do not require the use of current financial
resources and therefore are not reported as expenditures in the governmental funds This amount
represents the increase in liabilities for compensated absences ($3,875), other postemployment
benefits ($27,813) and workers compensation ($9,685) , offset by a decrease in liabilities for
interest payable ($2,075), judgments and claims ($2,217) and landfill closure and post closure
costs ($62) and an increase in net pension liability, net of deferred amounts ($46,784)

A‐30• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2016
1. The Financial Reporting Entity
a. Primary Government
The City of Boston (the City), incorporated as a town in 1630 and as a city in 1822, now exists under Chapter
486 of the Act of 1909 and Chapter 452 of the Acts of 1948 of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
(the Commonwealth), which, as amended, constitute the City’s Charter. The Mayor is elected to a four‐year
term and serves as chief executive officer of the City. The Mayor has general supervision of and control over
the City’s boards, commissions, officers, and departments. The legislative body of the City is the City Council,
which consists of 13 elected members serving two‐year terms.
The accompanying basic financial statements present the City and its component units. The component units
discussed below are included in the City’s reporting entity because of the significance of their operational or
financial relationships with the City.
b. Blended Component Units Disclosure
i. Boston Retirement System (BRS) is a defined benefit contributory retirement system created under
state statute. It is administered by a Retirement Board comprising five members: the City Auditor, who
serves ex officio; two individuals elected by participants in the system; a fourth member appointed by
the Mayor; and a fifth member chosen by the other members. BRS provides pension benefits to retired
City, Boston Planning & Development Agency, Boston Housing Authority, Boston Water and Sewer
Commission, and Boston Public Health Commission employees. Although legally separate, BRS
provides services entirely, or almost entirely, to the City and thus has been reported as a blended
component unit among the City’s fiduciary funds. The financial statements of BRS are included for its
fiscal year end which is December 31, 2015.
ii. Dudley Square Realty Corporation (DSRC) and Ferdinand Building Development Corporation (FBDC)
– The DSRC is a Qualified Active Low‐Income Community Business, and is the owner and developer of
the Dudley Municipal Center property. FBDC is the leverage lender of the Dudley Municipal Center
property. FBDC leases the property from DSRC and the City subleases the property from FBDC. The
DSRC and FBDC are non‐profit organizations qualified as tax‐exempt entities under Section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code. Both entities are instrumentalities of the City, as the Mayor has full
control of appointments to their boards of directors. Although legally separate, both DSRC and FBDC
provide services entirely, or almost entirely, to the City and thus have been reported as blended
component units. These funds are presented as non‐major funds within the other governmental funds
as of their fiscal year end, which is June 30, 2016.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • A‐31
c. Discretely Presented Component Units Disclosure
These component units are reported in a separate column to emphasize that they are legally separate from
the City but are included because the City is financially accountable for the organizations, meaning it appoints,
at a minimum, a voting majority of the board of directors of the organization and is able to impose its will on
the organizations or has a financial benefit or burden relationship with the organizations. Unless otherwise
indicated, the Notes to the Financial Statements pertain only to the primary government because certain
disclosures of the component units are not significant relative to the total component units and to the primary
government. A description of the component units, criteria for inclusion, and their relationship with the City
are as follows:
i.

Boston Planning & Development Agency (BPDA) – The BPDA is legally separate from the City and a
body politic and corporate constituting the City’s redevelopment authority and exercising the powers
of a planning board for the City. The BPDA is governed by a five‐member board, four of whom are
appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council, and one of whom is appointed by the
Governor of Massachusetts (same board members as the EDIC). The BPDA receives a significant
amount of intergovernmental revenue, which is used solely for capital projects that are under the
oversight of the BPDA. In accordance with GASB Statement No. 61, the BPDA is presented as a discrete
component unit of the City.

ii. Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston (EDIC) – The EDIC is legally separate
from the City and a body politic and corporate and an instrumentality of the Commonwealth. The EDIC
is governed by a five‐member board, four of whom are appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the
City Council, and one of whom is appointed by the Governor of Massachusetts (same board members
as the BPDA). The EDIC receives a significant amount of intergovernmental revenue, including grants
and contracts with the City for jobs and community service activities. In accordance with GASB
Statement No. 61, the EDIC is presented as a discrete component unit of the City.
iii. Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) – The BPHC is legally separate from the City and a body
politic and corporate and an instrumentality of the Commonwealth. The BPHC is governed by a seven‐
member board, six of whom are appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council, and one
of whom is the chief executive officer of the Boston Medical Center. The BPHC receives the majority
of its funding from a City appropriation, EMS and other third party billings, and federal and state
grants. The BPHC expects that the City will continue to provide support for the public health programs
of the BPHC. In accordance with GASB Statement No. 61, the BPHC is presented as a discrete
component unit of the City.
iv. Trustees of the Public Library of the City of Boston (TPL) – The TPL is legally separate from the City of
Boston and is a non‐profit organization qualified as a tax‐exempt entity under Section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code. The trustees of the TPL are appointed by the Mayor and the TPL places
substantial reliance upon the City to fund its daily operations. In addition, the Library receives
significant support through state and federal government appropriations and private sources. In
accordance with GASB Statement No. 61, the TPL is presented as a discrete component unit of the
City.
The financial statements of the discretely presented component units are included for their respective fiscal
year ends, which is June 30, 2016.

A‐32• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements
Complete financial statements of these discretely presented component units can be obtained through the
City Auditor’s office, Room M‐4, City Hall Plaza, Boston, Massachusetts 02201. In addition, condensed
financial statements for the discretely presented component units are included in note 20.
d. Related Organizations
The Mayor is also responsible for appointing members of the governing bodies of the Boston Housing
Authority, Boston Industrial Development Finance Authority, and Boston Water and Sewer Commission;
however, the City’s accountability for these organizations does not extend beyond making these
appointments.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies of the City conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as applicable to
governmental units as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The following is a
summary of the more significant policies followed by the City:
a. Government‐wide and Fund Financial Statements
The Government‐wide Financial Statements (i.e., the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of
Activities) report information on all of the nonfiduciary activities of the primary government and its
component units. For the most part, the effect of interfund activity has been removed from these statements.
Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues, are
reported separately from any business‐type activities, which rely to a significant extent on fees and charges
for support. The City currently reports no business‐type activities. Likewise, the primary government is
reported separately from certain legally separate component units for which the primary government is
financially accountable.
The Statement of Activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function or
segment is offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific
function or segment. Program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use, or
directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function or segment and 2) grants and
contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular function
or segment. Taxes and other items not properly included among program revenues are reported instead as
general revenues.
Separate financial statements are provided for Governmental Funds, Proprietary Funds, and Fiduciary Funds,
even though the latter are excluded from the Government‐wide Financial Statements. Major individual
Governmental Funds are reported as separate columns in the Fund Financial Statements.
b. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation
i. Government‐wide Financial Statements
The Government‐wide Financial Statements are reported using the economic resources measurement
focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the Proprietary Fund and Fiduciary Fund Financial
Statements. The Agency Fund within the Fiduciary Fund Financial Statements has no measurement of
results. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred,
regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year
for which they are levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility
requirements for recognition have been met.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • A‐33
ii. Governmental Fund Financial Statements
Governmental Fund Financial Statements are reported using the current financial resources
measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon
as they are “susceptible to accrual” (i.e., both measurable and available). Revenues not considered to
be available are recorded as deferred inflows of resources.
The City applies the susceptible to accrual criteria to property and other taxes and intergovernmental
revenues. In applying the susceptible to accrual concept to intergovernmental revenues, there are
essentially two types of revenues. In one, resources must be expended on the specific purpose or
project before any amounts will be reimbursed to the City; therefore, revenues are recognized based
upon the amount of expenditures incurred subject to availability requirements. In the other, resources
are virtually unrestricted and are usually revocable by the grantor only for failure to comply with
prescribed compliance requirements. These resources are reflected as revenues at the time of receipt
or earlier if the susceptible to accrual criteria are met. Property and other taxes are recognized as
revenue in the year for which taxes have been levied or earned, provided they are collected within 60
days after year‐end. Generally, intergovernmental revenues are recognized as revenue provided they
are earned during the year and collected within one year after year‐end, except for Massachusetts
School Building Authority (MSBA) and Chapter 90 receivables which are considered available when
received.
Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred. However, debt service expenditures,
as well as expenditures related to long‐term liabilities including compensated absences, other
postemployment benefits, workers’ compensation and judgments and claims, are recorded only when
payment is mature and due.
iii. Proprietary Fund Financial Statements
Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from nonoperating items. Operating
revenues and expenses generally result from the provision of services. The principal operating
revenues of the City’s Internal Service Funds are receipts from employer and employees for health
insurance premiums. Operating expenses for the Internal Service Fund include administrative
expenses, vendor payments, and health benefits. Any revenues and expenses not meeting this
definition are reported as nonoperating revenues and expenses.
iv. Description of Major Funds
Governmental funds – The City reports the following major governmental funds:
1.

The General Fund is the City’s primary operating fund. It accounts for all financial resources of
the general government, except those required to be accounted for in another fund.

2.

The Special Revenue Fund accounts for the proceeds of specific revenue sources (other than
trusts for individuals, private organizations, or other governments, or for major capital projects)
that are legally restricted or assigned to expenditures for various general governmental
functions.

3.

The Capital Projects Fund accounts for bond proceeds and grant revenues used for the
acquisition or construction of the City’s capital facilities.

Proprietary fund –The City reports the following proprietary fund:
4.

The City uses an internal service fund to account for its self‐insured health costs. Although the
fund is presented in a separate column in the accompanying proprietary fund financial
statements, it is not considered a major fund.

A‐34• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements
Fiduciary Funds – The City reports the following fiduciary fund types:
5.

The Private Purpose Trust Funds are used to account for resources legally held in trust for the
benefit of individuals, private organizations, or other governments. The City operates four pools
used for the improvement of the City’s parks and cemeteries, educational scholarships and
sporting equipment, creation of public utility and beauty, and co‐mingled nontestamentary
trusts.

6.

The Pension Trust Fund accounts principally for the activities of the Boston Retirement System,
a blended component unit, which accumulates resources for pension benefit payments to
retired employees of the City and other entities.

7.

The OPEB Trust Fund is an irrevocable trust fund established for other postemployment benefits.
The assets are appropriated from the General Fund and accumulate to reduce the unfunded
actuarial liability for health care and other postemployment benefits. The assets of the trust are
currently not used for direct payments of benefits.

8.

The Agency Funds are used to report funds held by the City in a purely custodial capacity. The
City currently operates a drug evidence account for proceeds of property seized from illegal drug‐
related activities. These funds are then used to offset the costs of technical equipment or
expertise and investigations.

c. Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, investments with original maturities of three months or less
when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.
d. Basis of Investment Valuation
Investments generally are presented in the accompanying basic financial statements at fair value. Where
applicable, fair values are based on quotations from national securities exchanges, except for certain
investments of BRS, which are described in notes 5 and 11. Further, income from investments is recognized
in the same fund as the related investments.
The City invests in the Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust (MMDT) Cash Portfolio, which is an external
investment pool and is not SEC‐registered. The fund is state‐regulated and is valued at amortized cost.
e. Interfund Receivables and Payables
Activity between funds that are representative of lending/borrowing arrangements outstanding at the end of
the fiscal year are referred to as either “due to/from other funds” (i.e., the current portion of interfund loans)
or “advances to/from other funds” (i.e., the noncurrent portion of interfund loans). All other outstanding
balances between funds are reported as “due to/from other funds.”
f.

Uncollectible Tax and Other Receivables
All receivables are shown net of an allowance for uncollectibles. Amounts considered to be uncollectible are
based on the type and age of the related receivable.

g. Capital Assets
Capital assets include property, plant, equipment, and infrastructure assets (e.g., roads, bridges, sidewalks,
and similar items), and intangible assets such as easements, land use rights, computer software, trademarks
and patents. Capital assets are reported in the governmental activities column in the Government‐wide
Financial Statements. Capital assets are defined by the City as assets with an initial, individual cost of more
than $25,000 and an estimated useful life in excess of one year. Such assets are recorded at historical cost or
estimated historical cost if purchased or constructed. Donated capital assets are recorded at acquisition value

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • A‐35
at the date of donation. Any significant construction commitments are encumbered at year‐end in the City’s
Capital Projects Fund.
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the capacity or efficiency of the asset or
materially extend assets’ useful lives are not capitalized.
Capital assets of the primary government are depreciated using the straight‐line method over the following
estimated useful lives:
Assets
Buildings
Building improvements
Infrastructure
Land improvements – major
Land improvements – playgrounds
Computer upgrades
Equipment and machinery
Intangible assets, computer software and licenses
Computers and related equipment
Furniture and fixtures

h. Compensated Absences
Employees are granted sick and vacation leave in varying amounts. Upon retirement, termination, or death,
certain employees are compensated for unused sick and vacation leave (subject to certain limitations) at their
then current rates of pay. Public Safety employees are compensated for unused personal leave in addition to
sick and vacation leave. The portion of the liability related to unused sick and vacation time that has matured
or is due as of June 30, 2016 is recorded in the Governmental Fund Financial Statements. The entire amount
of the liability is reported in governmental activities in the Government‐wide Financial Statements. The
liability for vacation leave is based on the amount earned but not used; for sick leave, it is based on the amount
accumulated at the balance sheet date that would be paid upon termination (vesting method). The liability
for both amounts is calculated based on the pay or salary rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
i.

Long‐Term Obligations and Related Costs
Long‐term debt and other long‐term obligations are reported as liabilities in the Government‐wide Statement
of Net Position. Bond premiums and discounts are capitalized and amortized over the life of the bonds using
the straight line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The unamortized portion is
presented in the Government‐wide Statement of Net Position as a component of bonds payable. Bond
issuance costs are reported as expenses when incurred.
The Governmental Fund Financial Statements recognize bond premiums and discounts, as well as bond
issuance costs, during the period incurred. The face amount of debt issued is reported as other financing
sources. Premiums received on debt issuances are reported as other financing sources while discounts on
debt issuances are reported as other financing uses. Issuance costs, whether or not withheld from the actual
debt proceeds received, are reported as debt service expenditures.

A‐36• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements
j.

Net Position and Fund Balance
In the Government‐wide and Proprietary Fund Financial Statements, net position is reported in the following
categories:
Net investment in capital assets: Capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, and outstanding
principal balances of debt attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those
assets.
Restricted: Net position the use of which is subject to constraints imposed by external parties,
including creditors, grantors, and laws and regulations of other governments, or imposed by City
Charter or enabling legislation. Nonexpendable amounts are required to remain intact under such
constraints.
Unrestricted: Remaining net position not considered net investment in capital assets or restricted.
For purposes of net position classification, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for
use, it is the City’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are needed.
In the Governmental Fund Financial Statements, fund balance is reported in the following categories:
Nonspendable: Amounts that cannot be spent because they are either not in spendable form or they
are legally or contractually required to remain intact.
Restricted: Amounts the use of which is subject to constraints imposed by external parties, including
creditors, grantors, and laws and regulations of other governments, or imposed by City Charter or
enabling legislation.
Committed: Amounts that can only be used for specific purposes pursuant to constraints imposed by
formal action of the government’s highest level of decision‐making authority. For the City, this formal
action takes the form of statutes which are passed by the City Council and approved by the Mayor.
Assigned: Amounts that are constrained by the City’s intent for use for specific purposes, but are
considered neither restricted or committed. Under M.G.L. Chapter 190, Acts of 1982, the City Auditor
has the authority to assign amounts to be used for specific purposes on behalf of the City.
Unassigned: Amounts in the general fund that are not otherwise constrained for a specific purpose
more narrow than the general operations of the City. The City maintains a formal policy that
unassigned fund balance in the General Fund be at least 15 percent of the current year’s General Fund
GAAP basis operating expenditures.
For purposes of fund balance classification, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for
use, it is the City’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are needed.
When unrestricted resources are used, committed resources are used first, followed by assigned and
unassigned resources, respectively.

k. Tax Abatement Refunds
Matured tax abatement refunds that are due and payable at June 30 have been recorded as a liability in the
General Fund. A liability for estimated future tax abatement refunds has been recorded in the Government‐
wide Statement of Net Position.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • A‐37
l.

Landfill Closure and Postclosure Care Costs
State and federal regulations require the City to place a final cover on its Gardner Street landfill site when it
stops accepting waste and to perform certain maintenance and monitoring functions at the site for 30 years
after closure. At June 30, 2016, 100% of the Gardner Street landfill site had been used and has not accepted
solid waste for several years. While most of the landfill closure construction was completed in prior years,
there still remains 12 acres of the landfill to be capped as of June 30, 2016.
The total current cost of landfill closure and postclosure care is an estimate, subject to changes resulting from
inflation, deflation, technology, or other changes in applicable laws or regulations. Such costs are recognized
as expenditures in the General Fund to the extent that they are due or matured and are expected to be paid
with expendable available financial resources. The total liability is reported in the Government‐wide
Statement of Net Position. Expenditures related to the Gardner Street landfill site postclosure care in fiscal
year 2016 were $62 thousand.

m. Use of Estimates
The preparation of the accompanying basic financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
n. Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements
The City adopted Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 72, "Fair Value
Measurement and Application." The scope of this statement is to improve financial reporting by clarifying the
definition of fair value for financial reporting purposes, establishing general principals for measuring fair value,
providing additional fair value application guidance, and enhancing disclosures about fair value
measurements. The City has incorporated the required disclosures about fair value measurements, but
adoption of the statement did not impact financial statement amounts.
3. Short‐Term Debt
During fiscal year 2016, the City had no short‐term debt issued or outstanding.
4. Budgetary Data
The General Fund is the only fund for which a budget is legally adopted. The budgets for all departments included
in the General Fund of the City, except the School Department, are prepared under the direction of the Mayor
and City Council. The School Department budget is prepared under the direction of the School Committee.
Original and supplemental appropriations are submitted by the Mayor, approved by the City Council, and lapse at
year‐end unless encumbered. The legal level of control over appropriations is at the department level.
Amendments to the original budget must be approved by the City Council, except for a reallocation of
appropriations of up to $3.0 million, which the Mayor may approve. Further, the City Auditor, with the approval
of the Mayor, may make transfers from any appropriation to any other appropriation for purposes of eliminating
deficits before closing the books for the fiscal year. After the close of the fiscal year, the City Auditor may, with
the approval of the Mayor, apply any income, taxes, and funds not disposed of and make transfers from any
appropriation to any other appropriation for the purpose of closing the accounts for the fiscal year.
The City must establish its property tax rate each year so that the resulting property tax levy will comply with the
limits required by Proposition 2‐1/2 (note 6). The tax levy must equal the sum of (a) the aggregate of all annual
appropriations for expenditures; plus (b) the reserve accounts described in the following paragraph; plus (c)

A‐38• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements
provision for the prior fiscal years’ deficits, if any; less (d) the aggregate of all non‐property tax revenues projected
to be received by the City, including available funds, in amounts certified or approved by the Commonwealth for
tax rate purposes.
In accordance with the 1986 amendments to the Funding Loan Act of 1982, the City has established two reserve
funds. The first is a budget reserve fund, which is required to be funded in stages to a final level of 2‐1/2% of the
prior year’s overall departmental appropriations, except the School Department, by the beginning of fiscal year
1990. It is available to be applied to extraordinary and unforeseen expenditures. The second is a separate reserve
fund of 1% to 2‐1/2% of the current year appropriation of the School Department to be applied to over
expenditures in that department.
The City’s General Fund budget is prepared on a basis other than accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP). The “actual” results column in the Statement of Revenues and Expenditures –
Budgetary Basis – General Fund is presented on a “budgetary basis” to provide a meaningful comparison of actual
results with the budget. The major differences between the budget and GAAP basis, where applicable, are that:
i.

Revenues are recorded when cash is received, except for real estate and personal property taxes,
which are recorded as revenue when levied (budget), as opposed to when susceptible to accrual
(GAAP).

ii. Encumbrances and continuing appropriations are recorded as the equivalent of expenditures (budget)
but have no effect on GAAP expenditures.
iii. Certain activities and transactions are presented in separate funds (GAAP), rather than as components
of the General Fund (budget).
iv. Amounts raised for the prior years’ deficits and available funds from prior years’ surpluses are
recorded as revenue items (budget), but have no effect on GAAP revenues.
In addition, there are certain differences in classifications between revenues, expenditures, and transfers. The
following reconciliation summarizes the differences between budgetary and GAAP basis accounting principles for
the year ended June 30, 2016 (in thousands):

5. Deposits and Investments
State and local statutes place certain limitations on the nature of deposits and investments available to the City.
Deposits, including demand deposits, money markets, and certificates of deposit in any one financial institution,
may not exceed 60% of the capital and surplus of such institution unless collateralized by the financial institution
involved. Investments from operating cash in the general fund may be made in unconditionally guaranteed U.S.
government obligations having maturities of a year or less from the date of purchase, or through repurchase
agreements with maturities of no greater than 90 days in which the underlying securities consist of such
obligations. Other allowable investments include authorized bonds of all states, bankers’ acceptances,
commercial paper rated within the three highest classifications established by rating agencies, and units in the
MMDT. MMDT, which is an external investment pool that is overseen by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, meets the criteria established by GASB 79 to report its investments at amortized cost; therefore
the City reports its investments in MMDT at amortized cost which approximates the net asset value of $1.00 per
share. MMDT has a maturity of less than 1 year and is not rated. The three highest commercial paper
classifications for Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s (S&P) are as follows:

a. Custodial Credit Risk
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of bank failure, the City’s deposits or investments may not be
returned. The City carries deposits that are fully insured by FDIC insurance or collateralized in the City’s name.
All of the City’s investments are held by third parties in the City’s name. As of June 30, 2016, the City of Boston
Trust Funds had uninsured and uncollateralized deposits of $14.6 million and uninsured and uncollateralized
investments of $1.5 million.
b. Investment Policy
The City’s primary concern in connection with its investment activities is a concern shared by all municipal
governments: the preservation of capital. The City’s investment policy establishes a discipline in which all of
the City’s investment activities may be safely conducted while it strives to use its capital resources as
efficiently as possible. The foundation of that discipline is fixed by Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) c. 44,
sec. 55, which prohibits Massachusetts communities from investing in certain categories of high‐risk
investments; limits the amount of the City’s bank deposits in any one financial institution; and establishes
qualifying criteria for banking institutions. Further, all investments held by third parties are to be held in the
City’s name.
c. Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment.
It is the City of Boston Trust Funds’ policy to limit the average duration of an actively managed fixed income
portfolio to no more than seven years. The following is a listing of the City’s fixed income investments (in
thousands) and related maturity schedule (in years) as of June 30, 2016:

e. Concentration Risk
The City adheres to the provisions of M.G.L. c. 44, sec. 55 when managing concentration risk. M.G.L. c. 44,
sec. 55 contains several restrictions limiting where and under what circumstances the City may deposit its
funds. No investments in a single issuer exceeded 5% of the City’s investment portfolio.
f.

Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of an
investment or a deposit. As of June 30, 2016, the City of Boston Trust Funds held international equity mutual
funds valued at $44.9 million. Although these investments are not denominated in a foreign currency, the
underlying securities are denominated in various foreign currencies.

g. Fair Value Hierarchy
Investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Recurring fair value measurements are those that
GASB statements require or permit in the Statement of Net Position or Balance Sheet at the end of each
reporting period. Fair value measurements are categorized based on the valuation inputs used to measure an
asset's fair value: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the
reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date; Level 2 inputs are other than quoted prices
in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, or similar assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly
through corroboration with observable market data; Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs that
are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • A‐41
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value.
Money market funds: Valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. Money market funds held by
the Pool are open‐end money market funds that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The money market funds held by the City and classified as Level 1 are deemed to be actively traded.
Institutional and mutual funds: Valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. Institutional and
mutual funds held by the City are open‐end funds that are registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The institutional and mutual funds held by the Pool and classified as Level 1 are deemed to be
actively traded. If market quotations are not readily available, the funds are valued by the pricing method
determined by investment managers which determines valuations using methods based upon market
transactions for comparable securities.
Equity securities: Consist primarily of corporate stocks traded on U.S. and non‐U.S. active security exchanges.
Stocks traded on active exchanges and valued at quoted market prices and documented trade history for
identical assets are categorized within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. If market quotations are not readily
available, the stocks may be valued using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs for similar
securities and are classified as Level 2.
US. Treasury and agency securities: Securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, authorities and
instrumentalities are valued using quoted prices, documented trade history in the security, and pricing models
maximizing the use of observable inputs determined by investment managers.
Corporate debt instruments: Valued either by using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs
for similar securities or valued by the investment manager.
The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net
realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the City believes its valuation
methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies
or assumptions to determine if the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair
value measurement at the reporting date.

A‐42• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements
Boston Retirement System (BRS or the System)
a. Custodial Credit Risk
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of bank failure, the System’s deposits may not be returned.
The System carries deposits that are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
insurance or collateralized with securities held by the System or the System’s agent in the System’s name. As
of December 31, 2015, all of the System’s deposits were insured or collateralized.
b. Investment Policy
The provisions of M.G.L. C. 32, Sec 23(2); 840 C.M.R. 16‐19, 21, 23, 26; and, the Plan’s own investment
regulations (stated at www.mass.gov/perac/investup/bostonintsup.html) govern the System’s investment
practice. Diversification is attained through varied investment management styles that comply with
Massachusetts state law. This is accomplished through the retention of investment managers that adhere to
M.G.L. C. 32, Sec. 3(3), the “Prudent Person” rule.
The System has retained an investment consultant to work with the Retirement Board in a fiduciary capacity
to assure that strategic investment diversification is attained, to employ investment managers with expertise
in their respective asset classes, and to closely monitor the implementation and performance of the respective
investment strategies.
The System is currently invested in stocks (domestic and foreign), fixed income securities (domestic and
foreign), real estate, private equity, PRIT and hedge funds.
c. Interest Rate Risk

The System’s guidelines do not specifically address limits on maturities as a means of managing its exposure
to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. The manager of each fixed income portfolio is
responsible for determining the maturity and commensurate returns of their portfolio.
The collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) held by the System as of December 31, 2015 are highly
sensitive to changes in interest rates.
d. Credit Risk
The System allows investment managers to apply discretion under the “Prudent Person” rule. Investments
are made, as a prudent person would be expected to act with discretion and intelligence, to seek reasonable
income, preserve capital, and, in general, avoid speculative investments.

In addition to the above schedule, the System has approximately $79.8 million invested in U.S. government
securities, which are not rated as they are explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government.
e. Concentration Risk
The System has no investments, at fair value, except for pooled funds, that exceed 5% of the System’s total
investments as of December 31, 2015.
The System adheres to the provisions of M.G.L. c. 32, sec. 23(2); 840 C.M.R. 16‐19, 21, 23, 26; and the Plan’s
own investment regulations when managing concentration risk.
f.

Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of an
investment or a deposit. Similar to the investments in domestic equities, the System employs or encourages
its investment advisor to employ diversification, asset allocation, and quality strategies.

g. PRIT Pooled Fund
The Commonwealth enacted Chapter 112, Section 17 of the Acts of 2010 that requires the System to invest
all assets, current and future, related to Boston Teachers in the Pension Reserves Investment Trust (PRIT)
fund. The PRIT fund is an external investment pool that is not registered with the Securities Exchange
Commission, but is subject to oversight provided by the Pension Reserves Investment Management Board

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • A‐45
(the PRIM Board). The PRIM Board was created by legislation to provide general supervision of the
investments and management of PRIT. PRIT is not a rated fund.
The fair value of the PRIT fund is based on unit value as reported by management of the PRIT fund. The PRIT
fund issues separately available audited financial statements with a year end of June 30.
As of December 31, 2015, the System had $1.3 billion invested in the PRIT pooled fund.
h. Derivatives
The System trades financial instruments with off‐balance‐sheet risk in the normal course of its investing
activities to assist in managing exposure to market risks. The System uses forward foreign currency contracts
to hedge against the risk of future foreign currency fluctuations.
i.

Securities Lending
The Public Employment Retirement Administration Commission of Massachusetts (PERAC) has issued
supplemental regulations that permit the System to engage in securities lending transactions. These
transactions are conducted by the System’s custodian, which lends certain securities owned by the System to
other broker dealers and banks pursuant to a form of loan agreement. The System and the borrowers
maintain the right to terminate all securities lending transactions on demand.
At the System’s direction, the custodian lends the System’s securities and receives cash (including both U.S.
and foreign currency), U.S. government securities, sovereign debt of foreign countries, and irrevocable bank
letters of credit as collateral. The custodian does not have the ability to pledge or sell collateral unless the
borrower defaults. Borrowers are required to deliver cash collateral in amounts equal to not less than 100%
of the market value of the loaned securities.
The System does not impose any restrictions on the amount of securities lent on its behalf by the custodian.
There were no failures by any borrowers to return loaned securities or pay distributions thereon and there
were no losses from a default of the borrowers or the custodian for the year ended December 31, 2015. The
cash collateral received by the custodian on each loan was invested, together with the cash collateral of other
qualified tax‐exempt plan lenders, in a collective investment pool. The relationship between the average
maturities of the investment pool and loans was affected by the maturities of the loans made by other plans
that invested cash collateral in the collective investment pool, which the System could not determine. At
December 31, 2015, the System had no credit risk exposure to borrowers because the amounts the System
owed the borrowers exceeded the amounts owed to the System.
At December 31, 2015, the fair value of securities loaned by the System amounted to $254.6 million, against
which was held collateral of $263.4 million as follows (in thousands):

Fixed income and equity securities classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are valued using prices quoted
in active markets for those securities. Fixed income securities classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are
valued using a matrixpricing technique. Matrix pricing is used to value securities based on the securities’
relationship to benchmark quoted prices.
The PRIT pooled fund is an external investment pool that is not registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, but is subject to oversight provided by the Pension Reserves Investment Management Board (the
PRIM board). The PRIM Board was created by legislation to provide general supervision of the investments and
management of PRIT. PRIT is not a rated fund. The fair value of the PRIT pooled fund is based on unit value as
reported by management of the PRIT pooled fund. The PRIT fund issues separately available audited financial
statements with a year‐end of June 30. The Plan is required to provide a 30 day redemption notice for this
investment.
The valuation method for investments measured at the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) is

1.

Global Multi‐strategy Hedge Fund of Funds. This type includes investments in 6 hedge funds that invest in
other hedge fund managers. Management of each hedge fund is given full discretion to invest with direct
hedge fund managers. The fair value of the investments in this type have been determined using the NAV per
share of the investments.

2.

Real Estate Funds. This type includes 29 real estate funds that invest primarily in U.S. commercial real estate.
The fair values of the investments in this type have been determined using the NAV per share (or its
equivalent) of the System’s ownership interest in partners’ capital. Distributions from each fund will be
received as the underlying investments of the funds are liquidated. It is expected that the underlying assets
of the funds will be liquidated over the next 7 to 10 years.

3.

Private Equity Funds. This type includes 59 private equity funds that invest primarily in U.S. companies. These
investments can never be redeemed with the funds; instead, the nature of the investments in this type is that
distributions are received through the liquidation of the underlying assets of the funds. It is expected that the
underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated over the next 7 to 10 years.

6. Property Taxes
Real and personal property taxes are based on values assessed as of each January 1. By law, all taxable property
must be assessed at 100% of fair cash value. Also by law, property taxes must be levied at least 30 days prior to
their due date. Once levied, these taxes are recorded as receivables, net of estimated uncollectible balances.
Property tax revenues have been recorded using the accrual and modified accrual basis of accounting as described
in note 2.

A‐48• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements
The City bills and collects its property taxes on a quarterly basis following the January 1 assessment. The due dates
for those quarterly tax billings are August 1, November 1, February 1, and May 1. Property taxes that remain
unpaid after the respective due dates are subject to penalties and interest charges.
Based on the City’s experience, most property taxes are collected during the year in which they are assessed.
Liening of properties on which taxes remain unpaid occurs annually. On December 15, 2015, all properties with
unpaid fiscal year 2015 property taxes were liened. The City ultimately has the right to foreclose on all properties
where the taxes remain unpaid.
A statewide property tax limitation known as “Proposition 2‐1/2” limits the amount of increase in the property
tax levy in any fiscal year. Generally, Proposition 2‐1/2 limits the total levy to an amount not greater than 2‐1/2
of the total assessed value of all taxable property within the City. Secondly, the tax levy cannot increase by more
than 2‐1/2 of the prior year’s levy plus the taxes on property newly added to the tax rolls. Certain provisions of
Proposition 2‐1/2 can be overridden by a citywide referendum.

The City participates in the Commonwealth’s school building assistance program, which is administered by
the MSBA. The MSBA provides financial assistance (up to 80% of total costs) to the City to build and/or
renovate schools. As of June 30, 2016, under this program funds totaling $21.0 million.
In the General Fund, the receivable is offset by deferred inflows of resources because the revenue is not
considered available. The following is a schedule of the four‐year paydown (in thousands) as of June 30, 2017

Section 108 is the loan guarantee provision of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.
Section 108 provides communities with a source of financing for economic development, housing
rehabilitation, public facilities, and large‐scale physical development projects. Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) provides grants or loans to local governments, which in turn provides loans to
developers. As of June 30, 2016, under this program, the City determined that $43.6 million was collectible.
This amount is recorded in the City’s Special Revenue fund.

On March 24, 2016, the City issued $148.1 million of general obligation and refunding bonds, including $140.0
million for various municipal capital projects and $8.1 million of refunding bonds for the purpose of refunding
certain outstanding general obligation bonds of the City totaling $9.2 million. Interest on the bonds are payable
semiannually each April 1 and October 1 until maturity in fiscal years 2027 and 2036, respectively.
The cash flow difference and economic gain (the difference between the present value of the debt service
payments and old and new debt) obtained from the March 24, 2016 refunding were $1.1 million and $0.9 million,
respectively.
The City has entered into various capital lease agreements for equipment acquisition. Payments under these

A‐54• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements
agreements are subject to annual appropriation and, by statute, are not included in the City’s debt limit
calculations. The gross amount of assets acquired under the equipment lease agreements totals $62.3 million as
of June 30, 2016. The City’s operating lease with DSRC is described in note 19.
No Obligation Debt
The City has outstanding industrial, commercial, and housing development bonds payable solely from revenues
of the respective enterprises that do not constitute an indebtedness of the City and are not charged against its
general credit. This aggregate amount is immaterial to the financial statements.
Defeased Debt
The principal amount of debt refunded through in‐substance defeasance transactions for governmental activities
and still outstanding at June 30, 2016 was approximately $144.2 million.
Debt Capacity
The City is subject to a dual general debt limit: the normal debt limit and the double debt limit. Such limits are
equal to 5% and 10%, respectively, of the valuation of taxable property in the City as last equalized by the
Massachusetts Department of Revenue. Debt may be authorized up to the normal debt limit without state
approval. Authorizations under the double debt limit, however, require the approval of the Commonwealth’s
Secretary of Administration and Finance. Additionally, there are many categories of general obligation debt, which
are exempt from the debt limit but are subject to other limitations.
As of June 30, 2016, the City may issue $3.73 billion of additional general obligation debt under the debt limit.
General obligation debt of $680.8 million, subject to the debt limit, and $75.7 million, exempt from the debt limit,
are authorized but unissued as of June 30, 2016.
11. Retirement Plans
a. Plan Description
The City contributes to the BRS, a cost‐sharing, multiple‐employer qualified defined benefit governmental
pension plan. The System provides retirement, disability, and death benefits to plan members and
beneficiaries of the following government units:
(1) City of Boston
(2) Boston Planning & Development Agency
(3) Boston Housing Authority
(4) Boston Water and Sewer Commission
(5) Boston Public Health Commission
(6) Sheriff of Suffolk County (Retirees as of December 31, 2009, funded by the City)
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts also is an other contributing entity and makes contributions to BRS
related to City of Boston teachers.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • A‐55
The System is administered by a five person Board of Retirement consisting of the City Auditor, who serves as
a member ex officio, two members who are elected by the participants, in or retired from the service of the
System, a fourth member appointed by the Mayor, and a fifth member chosen by the other members. A
complete set of financial statements for BRS for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 can be obtained
through the BRS, Boston City Hall, Room 816, Boston, MA 02201 or by accessing the
websitewww.cityofboston.gov/retirement/investment.asp.
Participation in the System is mandatory for all permanent, full time, and certain part‐time employees
immediately upon the commencement of employment. Participants who resign from employment, or are
receiving workers’ compensation benefits, and who are not eligible to receive a retirement allowance are
entitled to request a refund of their accumulated total deductions. In addition, those participants who resign
voluntarily with less than ten years of service are entitled to receive 3% per year interest; all others receive
interest which has accrued on their cumulative deductions at the regular interest rate (0.1% at December 31,
2015).
Employees with ten or more years of service having attained age 55 are entitled to pension benefits; an earlier
retirement is allowed upon completion of 20 years of service. The System provides for retirement allowance
benefits up to a maximum of 80% of a participant’s highest consecutive three‐year average annual rate of
regular compensation (highest consecutive five‐year average for those members who join the System on or
after April 2, 2013). Benefit payments are based upon a participant’s age, length of creditable service, regular
compensation, and group classification. Participants become vested after ten years of creditable service.
Effective July 1, 1998 Chapter 32 of the M.G.L. assigned the authority to establish and amend benefit
provisions and grant cost‐of‐living increases for the plan to the Boston Retirement Board.
If a member in service dies due to causes unrelated to his or her job, the surviving spouse and/or surviving
dependent children may receive benefits, either in a lump sum or in the form of an annuity based on the
length of service, contributions and age. In the event there are no spouse and/or dependent children named,
other beneficiaries may be entitled to a lump‐sum distribution. Participants who become permanently and
totally disabled from further duty may be eligible to receive accidental or ordinary disability retirement
benefits.
Accidental disability is provided to members with incapacitation resulting from a work‐related injury or
hazard. Generally, annual pension benefits are provided based on 72% of the annual rate of regular
compensation a member earned while an active employee on date of injury or average annual rate of regular
compensation. Ordinary disability is available to any member whose permanent incapacitation is not work‐
related and has attained ten years of creditable service. Such benefits are provided as if the member had
attained the age of 55 (or actual age if over 55) based on the amount of creditable service actually earned.
Limits are placed on how much a disability employee can earn from other sources while collecting a disability
retirement pension.
The City is legally responsible for funding the employer portion of all pensions associated with certain retirees
from the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD), which became part of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts in 2010, pursuant to a cooperation agreement (the Agreement) dated June 28, 2011.
According to the Agreement, all employees of the SCSD, or its predecessor department, who retired prior to
January 1, 2010 remained retirees of the BRS. In addition, members of AFSCME Local 419 who retired between
January 1, 2010 and October 31, 2010, remained retirees of the BRS. Employer contributions related to these
retirees are the responsibility of the City under the Agreement.

A‐56• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements
Special Funding Situations
The City is party to a special funding situation with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with respect to City
of Boston Teachers. The Commonwealth is responsible for funding the employer portion of all teacher
pensions in the Commonwealth. All teachers in the Commonwealth are members of the Massachusetts
Teachers Retirement System, with the exception of teachers employed by the City, who are members of BRS.
Although Boston Teachers are members of BRS, the Commonwealth is the responsible contributing entity as
described in Chapter 112 of the Massachusetts General Laws Acts of 2010.
The Commonwealth is also legally responsible for reimbursing BRS for a portion of the benefits payments for
cost of living increases granted before July 1997 as described in Chapter 112 of the Massachusetts General
Laws Acts of 2010.
b. BRS Basis of Accounting
The System’s financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Plan member
contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are due. Employer contributions are
recognized as additions in the period when they become due pursuant to formal statutory obligations.
Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms of the plan.
Investments are reported at fair value. The following is a description of the valuation techniques and inputs
used for each major class of assets and liabilities measured at fair value:
(1) Short‐term, Equity and Fixed Income Investments ‐ Securities traded on a national or international
exchange are valued at the last reported sales price at current exchange rates. Certain fixed income securities
not traded on an exchange are valued using a matrix pricing technique. Matrix pricing is used to value
securities based on the securities' relationship to benchmark quoted prices.
(2) Pooled funds ‐ the fair value of shares in managed investment pools is based on unit values reported by
the funds.
(3) Alternative investments include hedge funds, holding through commingled limited partnerships of venture
capital funds, including equity interests in early, middle, and later stage companies, as well as debt and equity
interests in buyouts, acquisitions, restructurings, mezzanine structures and special situations, such as
litigation or spin‐off activities. These investments are carried at the limited partnership interest or redemption
value, the equivalent of net asset value, which approximates fair value. Values assigned to such investments
are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that may ultimately be realized
in liquidation. Liquidation values depend largely on future circumstances, including marketability, and
frequently cannot reasonably be estimated until at, or near, the liquidation date.
(4) Real estate investments consist of interests in commercial properties held by various partnerships and
other limited liability entities, some of which utilize debt financing. Fair values of such holdings are reported
based on the net asset values of the entities, which are estimated using third‐party appraisals and other
information provided by property managers.

d. Contributions
Plan members are required to contribute to the System. Depending on their employment date, active
members must contribute a range of 5%–11% of their regular gross compensation. Non‐teacher members
hired after January 1, 1979 must contribute an additional 2% of regular compensation in excess of $30,000.
Participating employers are required to pay into the System their share of the remaining System‐wide
actuarially determined contribution, which is apportioned among the employers based on an actuarial
computation. The contributions of plan members and the participating employers are governed by Chapter
32 of the M.G.L. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the System was due $339.2 million from all employers
and the Commonwealth and received $339.2 million in these contributions. For the year ended June 30, 2016,
inclusive of contributions related to SCSD, and exclusive of contributions related to the City’s teachers, the
City’s required and actual contribution was $179.5 million. For the year ended June 30, 2016, the
Commonwealth’s required and actual contribution related to City Teachers was $120.4 million. The amount
is reported as intergovernmental revenue and retirement cost expenditures in the General Fund.

City Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources Related to Pensions
At June 30, 2016, the City reported a liability of $1.62 billion for its proportionate share of the BRS net pension
liability measured as of December 31, 2015. This net pension liability includes amounts related to SCSD
retirees and reflects a reduction for the special funding situations with the Commonwealth. The amount
recognized by the City as its proportionate share of the net pension liability, the proportionate share related
to the Commonwealth special funding situations, and the total portion of the net pension liability associated
with the City measured at December 31, 2015 were as follows (in thousands):

To determine employers' proportionate share of the net pension liability, separate calculations of net pension
liability were performed for each of the Commonwealth special funding situations, SCSD retirees, and the
remaining non‐teacher group. At December 31, 2015, the City was allocated 100% of the net pension liability
for SCSD retirees and 81.71% of the remaining non‐teacher group based on its proportion of 2015 required
employer contributions related to this group. The City’s proportion of the collective BRS net pension liability
at December 31, 2015 was 36.78% compared to 36.82% at December 31, 2014.
For the year ended June 30, 2016, in the Government‐wide financial statements, the City recognized pension
expense of $462.8 million and revenue of $236.5 million related to the Commonwealth special funding
situations. At June 30, 2016, the City reported deferred outflows of resources related to pensions from the

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • A‐59
For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of
resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the BRS
and additions to/deductions from the BRS’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis
as they are reported for the BRS.
g. Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability for the December 31, 2015 measurement date was determined by using an actuarial
valuation as of December 31, 2013, with updated procedures used to roll forward the total pension liability
to December 31, 2015. The measurement at December 31, 2015 applied the following actuarial assumptions:
Inflation
Salary Scale
Investment rate of return,
including inflation
Cost of living adjustments
Mortality

3.25% for BRS excluding teachers and 4.5% for teachers
7.5% to 4% percent, indexed by year of service, for teachers
and 4.5% to 4% for non‐teachers
7.75% for BRS excluding teachers and 7.5% for teachers,
net of expenses, including inflation
3 % of first $13,000
RP‐2000 mortality tables projected using scale BB2D for BRS excluding teachers, and
RP‐2014 mortality tables projected using scale BB2D for teachers

The salary scale for non‐teachers indicated above was a reduction from a range of 5.0% to 4.5% used in the
measurement of the total pension liability as of December 31, 2014. Additionally, the investment rate of
return of 7.5% for teachers indicated above was a reduction from the 8.0% used in the December 31, 2014
measurement.
The long‐term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building‐block
method in which best‐estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of
pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are
combined to produce the long‐term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of
return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation.
Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the target asset
allocation as of the actuarial valuation date of December 31, 2013 for BRS, excluding Teachers, are
summarized below:

h. Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.75% for BRS excluding Teachers. The
projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumes that contributions from plan members
will be made at the current contribution rate and that contributions of participating employers and the
Commonwealth will be made at rates equal to the actuarially determined contribution rates. Based on those
assumptions, the BRS's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future
benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long‐term expected rate of return on pension plan
investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.

12. Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB)
GASB Statement No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other
Than Pensions, requires governments to account for OPEB, primarily healthcare, on an accrual basis. The effect is
the recognition of an actuarially required contribution as an expense on the Government‐wide Statement of
Activities when a future retiree earns their postemployment benefit. To the extent that an entity does not fund
their actuarially required contribution, a postemployment benefit liability is recognized on the Government‐wide
Statement of Net Position over time. OPEB benefits are reported as expenditures on a pay‐as‐you‐go basis in the
governmental funds.
In addition to the pension benefits described in note 11, the City provides postemployment healthcare and life
insurance benefits, in accordance with state statute and City ordinance, to participating retirees and their
beneficiaries. Participating retirees are City retirees. As of June 30, 2015, the most recent actuarial valuation date,
approximately 14,700 retirees and 14,300 active members meet the eligibility requirements as put forth in
Chapter 32B of M.G.L. The City sponsors and participates in an agent multi‐employer defined benefit OPEB plan.
The Boston Public Health Commission, a discretely presented component unit, also participates and contributes
to the plan. The OPEB plan is administered by the City and does not issue a stand‐alone financial report.
Medical and prescription drug benefits are provided to all eligible retirees not enrolled in Medicare through a
variety of plans offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, and
Neighborhood Health Plan. Medical and prescription drug benefits are provided to retirees enrolled in Medicare
through supplemental and Medicare Advantage plans offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Harvard
Pilgrim HealthCare, and Tufts Health Plan.
Groups 1 and 2 retirees, including teachers, with at least 10 years or 20 years of creditable service are eligible at
age 55 or any age, respectively. Group 4 retirees with at least 10 years or 20 years of creditable service are eligible
at age 45 or any age, respectively. Retirees on accidental disability retirement are eligible at any age, while
ordinary disability requires 10 years of creditable service. The surviving spouse is eligible to receive pre and
postretirement death benefits, as well as medical and prescription drug coverage.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • A‐61
a. Funding Policy
Employer and employee contribution rates are governed by the respective collective bargaining agreements.
The OPEB Plan is currently funded on a pay‐as‐you‐go basis plus periodic advance funding contributions as
amounts are available. The employers and plan members share the cost of benefits. As of June 30, 2015, the
valuation date, the plan members contribute 11% to 28.50% of the monthly premium cost, depending on the
plan in which they are enrolled. The City contributes the balance of the premium cost.
b. Basis of Accounting
The OPEB Trust Fund is prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Employer contributions to the plan are
recognized when made. Benefits are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms of each
plan.
Investments are reported at fair value. Fair value of securities held directly are based on quotations from
national securities exchanges.
c. Annual OPEB Cost and Net OPEB Obligation
The City’s annual OPEB expense is calculated based on the annual required contribution of the employer
(ARC), an amount actuarially determined in accordance with the parameters of GASB Statement No. 45. The
ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is projected to cover the normal cost each
year and amortize any unfunded actuarial liability over a period of 30 years. The following table shows the
components of the City’s annual OPEB cost for the year ended June 30, 2016, the amount actually contributed
to the plan, and the change in the City’s net OPEB obligation based on an actuarial valuation as of June 30,
2015 (in thousands):

Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and assumptions
about the probability of occurrence of events far into the future. Examples include assumptions about future
employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts determined regarding the funded status of
the plan and the annual required contributions of the City are subject to continual revision as actual results
are compared with past expectations and new estimates are made about the future. The schedule of funding
progress, presented as required supplementary information following the Notes to Financial Statements,
presents multiyear trend information that shows whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or
decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits.
e. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions
Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the substantive plan (the plan as
understood by the City and plan members) and include the types of benefits provided at the time of each
valuation and the historical pattern of sharing of benefit costs between the City and plan members to that
point. The actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are designed to reduce
short‐term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent with the
long‐‐term perspective of the calculations.
The most recent actuarial valuation was performed as of June 30, 2015. The projected unit credit cost method
was used. The actuarial assumptions included a 7.0% investment rate of return, an inflation rate of 4.5% and
an annual healthcare cost trend rate of 7.0 ‐ 8.0% initially, reduced by decrements to an ultimate rate of 5.0%
after 5 – 6 years. The actuarial value of assets was determined using the fair value of investments. The
healthcare cost trend rate differs between the master medical and other healthcare plans. The City’s UAAL is
being amortized as a level percentage of pay on an open basis. The remaining amortization period at July 1,
2015 was 30 years.

16. Commitments and Contingencies
The City has committed $76.5 million in encumbrances for purchase orders, contracts, and judgments and claims
in the General Fund, $55.6 million in the Special Revenue Fund, $185.6 million in the Capital Projects Fund, and
$287 thousand in Other Governmental Funds.
Infrastructure Investment Incentive Transactions
Infrastructure Investment Incentive transactions (I‐Cubed) are governed by Chapter 293 of the Acts of 2006 (the
Act). Under the Act, the funding for the projects associated with these transactions is provided through proceeds
of bonds issued by the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency (MDFA) and is to be used for approved public
infrastructure improvements undertaken by the developer. The debt service on these bonds will be paid by the
Commonwealth through State Infrastructure Development Assistance to the extent that New State Tax Revenues
generated once the project is operational offset the amounts paid to MDFA to cover the debt service. When this
is not the case, the participating municipality or developer generally will be responsible for the shortfall depending
on the transaction agreement. The Act provides for the establishment of a Municipal Liquidity Reserve (MLR) from
which the participating municipality can draw to offset any required payments made to the Commonwealth. The
MLR is generally funded by the developer either through cash or a direct pay letter of credit.
During fiscal year 2015, the City executed two Infrastructure Development Assistance Agreements (IDAA) for
I‐Cubed transactions. Under the first IDAA, $32.4 million in bonds were issued by MDFA in September 2015. Also,
an MLR of $1.2 million was established at the time of the issuance of the bonds. This reserve is equal to twice the
maximum annual debt service payable in any fiscal year on the bonds issued under the indenture. The City is
obligated for any shortfalls between debt service on the bonds and New State Tax Revenues. However, it has the
right to assess the developer or draw from the MLR for any payments on such obligations. The City had no
obligation for any shortfalls at June 30, 2016. The City also recorded $11.2 million in donated capital assets in
fiscal year 2016 for improvements to City‐owned infrastructure made by the developer. These assets have been
recorded at acquisition value which has been defined as "the price that would be paid to acquire an asset with
equivalent service potential in an orderly market transaction at the acquisition date."
Under the second IDAA, $10.0 million in bonds were issued by MDFA in fiscal year 2016. The City is obligated for
any shortfalls between debt service on the bonds and New State Tax Revenues. However, it has the right to assess
the developer or draw from the MLR for one‐third of any payments on such obligations. The City had no obligation
for any shortfalls at June 30, 2016.
In connection with this second I‐Cubed transaction, the City has a leasehold interest in a portion of the parking
garage, which represents the public infrastructure improvements under the transaction, created under a master
lease and its assignments and a sublease. With the execution of the master lease and sublease agreements, along
with the assignment agreements transferring the interests of the owner of the parking garage to the City through
the BPDA, the City essentially becomes the lessee on the master lease and the sub‐landlord on the sublease. This
results in the City having no responsibility for the operation of the parking garage and having the right to collect
from the sub‐lessee Section 121A PILOT payments from 2015 through 2036 and then base rent from 2036 through
2055, both of which are largely based on a percentage of gross revenues of the parking garage. The City has no
obligation for any payments as lessee under the master lease.
17. Public Health System
Effective July 1, 1996, the City’s Department of Health and Hospitals and Trustees of Health and Hospitals were
abolished. Substantially all their assets and liabilities, including title to the City’s two hospitals, BCH and Boston
Specialty and Rehabilitation Hospital (BSRH), were transferred to and assumed by BPHC.

A‐66• City of Boston Basic Financial Statements
Also effective July 1, 1996, the operations of BCH and BSRH were consolidated with the operations of the Boston
University Medical Center under the licensure and control of the BMC.
The BPHC receives the majority of its funding from federal and state grants, and a City appropriation. During fiscal
year 2016, the City appropriated $76.2 million to the PHC. As described below, the BPHC uses the appropriation
to pay debt service on certain general obligation bonds, for administrative purposes and to support the various
public health programs run by the PHC. The City has budgeted $77.3 million for the BPHC for fiscal year 2017.
Due from BPHC/BMC
General obligation bonds issued by the City between December 1967 and October 1995, for which BPHC was
responsible for repayment, have been fully repaid as of June 30, 2016. These bonds pertained to the property and
operations of the BCH Campus, South Block Campus, BSRH Campus, Emergency Medical Services Operations, and
the Long Island Campus.
In addition, the BPHC is also responsible for reimbursing the City for health insurance, equipment lease payments,
workers’ compensation, and other miscellaneous expenses paid for by the City.
18. Risk Management
The Risk Management Program focuses on a planned strategy of self‐insurance, supported by strong prevention
and cost reduction efforts, financial reserves and catastrophic insurance. The City is self‐insured in most areas of
risk including general liability, property and casualty, workers’ compensation, certain employee health care costs
and unemployment compensation.
The City’s legal liabilities are capped per M.G.L. Chapter 258, and Corporation Counsel defends the City in any
lawsuits that arise from the normal course of operations. For workers’ compensation, the City is exempt from
state insurance requirements per M.G.L. Chapter 152 Section 25B. The City’s Workers’ Compensation Division, as
well as the Police and Fire Departments, manage employee injury claims internally. The City budgets for and funds
legal claims and employee injury costs through the General Fund, charging specific departments for their share of
costs in order to promote awareness and prevention efforts.
The City provides health insurance coverage for employees and retirees through a variety of insured and
self‐insured plans. The City budgets for and funds the premium costs for all plans through the General Fund.
Self‐insured plans are financially managed through the Internal Service Fund established in compliance with
M.G.L. Chapter 32B, Section 3A. In fiscal year 2013, a guiding policy for the more prudent management of the City
of Boston Health Claims Trust Fund was established. This policy states that accounting for the fund will be in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and will ensure that all contributions and actual costs
are shared between employers and their subscribers according to predetermined ratios.
For unexpected large losses, the City maintains a catastrophic risk reserve, which has an available balance of $31.1
million at the end of fiscal 2016. To further protect the City’s assets and finances from adverse loss, commercial
insurance is purchased strategically for certain exposures. A catastrophic property insurance policy provides
$100.0 million for all risk protection after a $10.0 million deductible. Boiler and machinery losses are insured up
to $25.0 million per incident, after a $50 thousand deductible.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • A‐67

the potential claims against the City not recorded in the accompanying basic financial statements resulting from
such litigation would not materially affect the basic financial statements.

developer of the Dudley Municipal Center property. FBDC is the leverage lender of the Dudley Municipal Center
property. As the project sponsor during fiscal year 2013, the City authorized and issued $28.9 million in general
obligation bonds and transferred proceeds to FBDC. FBDC, utilizing these bond proceeds, made loans totaling
$29.3 million to two investment funds. As of June 30, 2016, $29.3 million is due to FBDC on such loans. The
investment funds made these proceeds and funds from additional investments available to eight leverage lenders
that made loans in the aggregate amount of $40.8 million to DSRC to finance the Dudley Municipal Center project.
This amount is recorded in the City’s Notes and Leases Payable line of note 10. With the completion of the Dudley
Municipal Center project, FBDC is the master tenant and leases the project from DSRC.

major economic, demographic and market indicators, and historical, statistical and other information.
This report contains estimates that are based on expectations and assumptions which existed at the time
estimates were prepared. In light of the important factors that may materially affect economic conditions of the City,
the inclusion in this report of such estimates should not be regarded as a representation of the BPDA or the City that
such estimates will occur.
The information contained herein has been furnished by the BPDA and certain information has been obtained
from other sources which are believed to be reliable, but is not guaranteed as to accuracy or completeness, and is not

THE BOSTON ECONOMY
Boston is the twenty-third largest city, in terms of population, in the United States and the economic hub of
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Commonwealth”). It is a center for professional services, business,
finance, technology, research and development, higher education and health care, as well as for transportation,
exports, communications, culture and entertainment. Boston is the capital of the Commonwealth and is host to
several federal regional offices.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (“ACS”) Boston’s population for
2015 was 669,469. The BPDA Research Division estimates there are 757,340 payroll and non-payroll jobs in Boston
as of 2015 based on data provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (“BEA”) and Massachusetts Executive
Office of Labor and Workforce Development (“EOLWD”). Boston’s jobs represent 16.7% of the total statewide
jobs.
Overview of Recent Economic Conditions
Boston’s economy, on average, outperformed both Massachusetts and the nation in terms of job growth
from 2006 through 2016. During that period Boston’s average annual job growth was 1.7%. Following the start of
the Great Recession in December 2007, the national economy experienced rising unemployment and deteriorating
economic conditions. In late 2008 Boston’s economy began to show signs of a weakening labor market, and
economic conditions worsened from late 2008 until February 2010, when positive job growth returned. Payroll jobs
grew in Boston at an average annual rate of 2.2% from 2010 through 2015, exceeding the national recovery.
Boston’s unemployment rate for 2016 was 3.5%, which was almost 1.5 percentage points less than the national rate.
Similar to the job market, Boston’s office real estate market experienced a downward shift beginning in the
last half of 2008 through mid-2010. The housing market in Boston, also hurt by the recession’s rising foreclosures
and tight lending market, saw reductions in sales volumes and small to moderate drops in prices. However, Boston’s
commercial real estate market rebounded and continues to show strong growth. Factors influencing commercial
development include growth in high tech sectors, high rents, low interest rates, low unemployment rates, and
population growth. Residential markets are showing strong growth with increasing prices and stable sales volumes.
Lower vacancies and population growth coincide with price levels and rents. The 2016 median house price in
Boston was $497,500.
Statistical Data
Statistical data relating to population, employment and income are derived primarily from four separate
sources: the U.S. Census Bureau; the BEA; the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (the “BLS”);
and the City of Boston and the BPDA, each of which is described below.
The Census Bureau publishes information about population, housing and the economy. The most recent
decennial Census data are from the 2010 Census. In addition, some monthly, quarterly and annual data are available
through December 2016 on certain topics for the region, the Commonwealth, and Metropolitan Boston 1. The Census
Bureau also publishes the ACS, which provides data through 2015 on a citywide basis and by census tract.
The BEA publishes quarterly and annual statistics on income and employment. The most recent annual
figures for the nation, Massachusetts and Metropolitan Boston are for 2015. The City accounts for approximately
85.5% of Suffolk County’s population and approximately 96% of its employment. The BLS publishes data and
reports about the workforce and related subjects including unemployment rates, area wages, and cost-of-living
adjustments. The most recent monthly data are for December 2016.
The City and the BPDA prepare reports and compile data on the population and economy of the City and
its neighborhoods. The BPDA also analyzes and reports on local, regional, state and national trends obtained from
public and private sources on the following topics: employment, occupations, large employers, City schools,
1

Federal data sources have three prevailing definitions of the Boston Metropolitan Area. Each table with Metropolitan data explains whether
Metropolitan Boston refers to: the Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”), the New England City and Town Area (“NECTA”), or Combined
Statistical Area (“CSA”). Revised data was unavailable for Boston-Cambridge-Quincy MA-NH MSA and NECTA. All data was revised to
reflect the new Boston-Cambridge-Newton MA-NH MSA and NECTA Division

universities and colleges, medical institutions, tourism and lodging, transportation, office and industrial markets,
housing, building activity, urban redevelopment, and infrastructure projects.
The statistical data contained in this report represent the latest published data available. While the City
believes that it has used the most recent available data in this report, the data contained herein may not reflect
current conditions or trends because of publication lags resulting from time required to collect, tabulate, and publish
the data. Moreover, statistical data are approximations and generalizations subject to various sources of error
inherent in the statistical process, and may be revised on the basis of additional data. The statistical data contained
herein describes past activity and are not presented in order to suggest the continuation of any trend, or to predict
future economic activity either in particular categories or in general.
Population, Income and Employment
Boston’s population from the 2010 Census was 617,594 which represented a 4.8% increase from the 2000
count of 589,141. The Census Bureau’s 2010 population count for Metropolitan Boston was 4,552,402, representing
an increase of 3.7% since 2000. Massachusetts’ 2010 Census enumeration was 6,547,629, a gain of 3.1% over the
2000 count. The most recent ACS (2015) estimates the City of Boston’s total population to be 669,469. The average
annual growth for the City from 2010 through 2015 is 1.6%. Recent trends suggest Boston’s population is growing
at faster rates than in prior decades.

Suffolk) and two counties in New Hampshire (Rockingham and Strafford), as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 1990, 2000, and 2010 Decennial Census; 2014 and 2015 American Community Survey one-year estimates,
January 2017.

The 2015 ACS showed that Boston’s racial composition was White, Non-Hispanic 44.7%; Black, NonHispanic 22.9%; Hispanic 19.5%; Asian/Pacific Islander 9.4%; Multi-racial 2.3%; other single race 1.1%; and
Native American 0.1%. The Hispanic and Asian populations have grown dramatically, growing about 54% and
44%, respectively, from 2000 to 2015, while other populations have seen small growth or decline. Immigration has
been a prime driver of increases in the Hispanic and Asian populations. In 2015, the foreign-born population, which
was 29.3% Hispanic and 23.8% Asian, made up 28.4% of Boston’s total population.
Boston continues to be a city of young adults due to the large number of students and young professionals
living and working in the City. Thirty-five percent of all persons in Boston in 2010 were between 20 and 34 years
old compared to 33% in 2000. The fastest growing age group in Boston between 2000 and 2015 was the age group
55 to 64, which saw a 61.5% increase. This is consistent with national trends and the aging of the baby boom
population. Boston’s elderly population (ages 65 and over) grew to 70,964 people, but has remained just over 10%
of the total population. Boston’s population of school age children (ages 5 to 14) is 56,905, a level it has maintained
since the dramatic fall from over 100,000 in the 1970s.
Along with population growth, the number of households in Boston has also grown, to 261,492 according
to the 2015 ACS. The share of these households that are families (related or married people living together) remains
stable at 47.7% of all households in 2015. The group quarters population, especially students in dormitories,
continued to increase, up to 48,293 in 2015. Household size increased from 2.26 persons in 2010 to 2.38 persons in
2015.

In 2015, Massachusetts had a population of approximately 6.8 million people and 4.5 million jobs,
according to BEA annual data. Between 2011 and 2015 the number of jobs in Massachusetts grew by 2.1%.
Massachusetts personal income, net inflation, grew at an average annual rate of 2.5% from 2011 through 2015, onetenth of a percentage point less than the national income growth over the same period.
Metropolitan Boston had 4.8 million people and 3.4 million jobs in 2015. From 2011 through 2015,
Metropolitan Boston experienced an average annual growth in jobs of 2.2%. The MSA’s total personal income, net
inflation, from 2011 through 2015 grew at an average annual rate of 2.7%, following national trends during that
period.

warehousing. The largest industries in the city are health care and social assistance, professional and technical
services, finance and insurance, government, accommodation and food services, and education.
The table below shows Boston’s employment growth by industry category for 2011 through 2015. The
industry categories are in the North American Industrial Classification System (“NAICS”) format, which the BEA
began using in 2001. Suffolk County data is mathematically reduced to the Boston geography using unemployment
insurance coverage data (Employment Security, ES-202, for cities and towns from the Massachusetts EOLWD.
Total employment in Boston rose to the highest level in recent decades and unemployment fell below three
percent in the last quarter of 2016. Boston’s job growth was positive across most industries since the recession, but
was mostly concentrated in health care and social assistance, professional and technical services, and education. The
health care and social assistance industry employs the largest number of people in Boston, 18.5 percent of total jobs,
while transportation and warehousing has passed professional and technical services as the fastest growing industry
since the recession at 3.7 percent per year. The job growth in transportation and warehousing is predominantly in
non-payroll positions. Educational services is an area of specialization for Boston with an employment share three
times the national average. The most recent economic conditions In Boston show steady growth in the labor market.

In addition to this strong overall growth, the high tech sector jobs grew by nine percent per year since 2002.
Boston’s high tech industries benefit from supportive public policies and high tech clusters that foster synergistic
innovation. Major Boston high tech clusters include the Innovation District, which provides high tech startups a
place to grow, and world class centers for medical research in the Longwood Medical Area and surrounding
Massachusetts General Hospital. In December 2016, Reebok announced it would move its headquarters to Boston in
fall of 2017, making it the third footwear company to move its headquarters to Boston.
The following table indicates that, as of 2015, 69% of employed City residents were white-collar workers

In addition to private employers, the public sector has large numbers of employees in the City. According
to a preliminary estimate by the BPDA, using a series consistent with the BEA, there were 76,708 federal, state and
local government workers in the City in 2015. Boston is home to large state government offices, federal regional
offices, U.S. Postal Service facilities, state-chartered authorities and commissions (such as the Massachusetts Port
Authority and the Boston Water and Sewer Commission), and the City’s local government agencies and
departments.
Labor Force and Education
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the City’s resident labor force has been steadily increasing from 1980
through 2015. The increase in the number and age of the population have combined with the rising labor force
participation of women, minorities, youth and the elderly to produce a larger labor force. From 2000 through 2010
Boston’s population rose by 3.1% and the employed resident workforce grew by 5.0%. By 2015, Boston’s
population grew to 669,469, of which 366,392 residents were employed.
General improvement in educational attainment continued throughout the 1980-2015 period. The percentage
of adult residents (aged 25 and over) that had completed four or more years of college more than doubled from
20.3% to 46.6%. Improving educational attainment supported the City’s transformation to a knowledge-based
economy.

The Mayor's Office of Workforce Development (OWD), a division of the BPDA, is the City's workforce
development funder that promotes the full participation of all Boston residents in the City's economic vitality. OWD
policies and programs ensure that low-income Boston residents, adults and youths, are connected to the training
necessary to obtain career-oriented employment that leads to economic stability. Programs and services offered
through OWD grants include adult basic education, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), High School
diploma/HiSET, occupational skills training, transitional job experience, career exploration, and support services
which address a wide range of individual and family needs.

7

OWD funded over 80 community-based organizations to provide a variety of services to greater Boston’s
residents in fiscal 2016, disbursing over $11 million. These services include apprenticeship training in hospitality
and construction trades, career exploration and alternative education programs for young adults, summer youth
employment, and adult ESOL programs. OWD also oversees and convenes the region's one stop career centers
(American Job Centers), which served 15,661 job seekers and over 380 employers. 83% of career center customers
remained employed through the second and third quarter after they exited the program. In addition, OWD served
1,540 youth in publicly-supported summer jobs and 91 youth engaged in year-round employment through OWD
grants. Overall in Boston, there were over 10,436 youth placed in summer employment. Linkage contributions paid
into the Neighborhood Jobs Trust provide supplemental sources of funding for job training and adult education
programs. For a full discussion of the City’s jobs linkage program, as well as the housing linkage program, see “The
Linkage Program,” later in this section.
Income, Wages, and Cost of Living
Per capita personal income for Suffolk County was $66,871 in 2015, 37.5% above the national per capita
personal income of $48,632, according to the BEA. City residents constitute approximately 86% of the county’s
population. The summary table below shows the per capita income from 1980 through 2015 for Suffolk County,
Metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts, and the nation. Annual growth for per capita income was practically double the
national average for Massachusetts, Metropolitan Boston, and Suffolk County from 2000 to 2015. The city’s median
household income (in fixed 2016 dollars), based on Census data from the ACS, was $58,998 in 2015. Per capita
personal income reflects earned income of persons residing in the named areas plus rents, interest and other
unearned income and transfer payments from governmental entities. As such, these figures take into account income
sources not included in the survey of average annual wages in the following paragraph, which reflects earned
income of persons who work (but do not necessarily reside) in the named areas.

Medical and Higher Educational Institutions
Boston’s medical and educational institutions are important components of its economy, providing
employment opportunities for residents of the City and Metropolitan Boston. Expenditures by these institutions, as
well as their employees, patients, students and visitors, stimulate the City’s trade and service sectors. There are

respectively. Based on total graduate, undergraduate, and professional school enrollment, Northeastern University
became the largest university in Boston in the fall of 2016, with 32,817 students. Boston, with nearly 10% of the
Commonwealth’s population, has about a quarter of the statewide college student enrollment. According to the
Boston Department of Neighborhood Development, a total of 1,187 dormitory beds were permitted in 2015, with
another 1,971 under construction. Construction of additional student housing is underway at the New England
Conservatory and Emerson College.
In 2016, the BPDA approved 1.4 million new square feet of institutional development across the city.
These new projects primarily came from major educational institutions. The projects highlighted below capture
some of the major institutional developments either completed, under construction, or approved.



In 2016 Boston College received approval for: a 240,000 square foot recreation center that will house a
variety of physical activity and support spaces, and the Brighton Athletic Fields, which includes newly
constructed baseball and softball fields. Boston College also proposed an 116,000 square foot indoor
practice facility, which is still under review.
Northeastern University received approval for a new student housing project that will contain
approximately 800 beds in apartment units. Construction is set to commence in early 2017.

Tourism and Culture
Boston ranks among the top ten destinations in North America for conventions, meetings, and trade shows,
based on the number and quality of the shows booked. Boston currently has three main convention sites—the John
B. Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center (“Hynes”), the Seaport World Trade Center, and the 2.1 million
square-foot Boston Convention & Exhibition Center (“BCEC”), the largest building in New England and capable of
hosting large national and international events. In late summer of 2014, the Massachusetts Convention Center
Authority (“MCCA”) also opened “The Lawn on D,” a flexible outdoor public and event space immediately
adjacent to the BCEC. In 2015 the Hynes and the BCEC hosted a combined total of 262 events with an aggregate of
724,290 attendees. This resulted in approximately 632,430 hotel room nights and generated an overall economic
impact of approximately $784 million, according to the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority (“MCCA”).
Fiscal 2016 featured the best operating performance for the MCCA since the BCEC opened in 2004. Total fiscal
10

2016 operating revenues totaled $71 million, an eight percent increase from the previous year. The BCEC alone
generated $40 million in revenue, setting a record high.
Downtown Boston saw significant new cultural amenities in 2015 and 2016. A new Winter Market and ice
skating rink opened on City Hall Plaza in the winter of 2016. This revitalization project on City Hall Plaza is only
the first of a series of improved uses for the space. The large redevelopment of the North Station Boston Garden
area, a 1.87 million square feet mixed use development, was approved in 2013 and broke ground in January 2016.
Phase 1 of the project, is currently under construction and includes improvements to North Station, a four-level
below grade parking garage, and a four to six story podium. It also encompasses Champions Row, which is the new
entrance to the TD Garden and contains a few restaurants and a movie theater. Phases 2 and 3 will introduce a hotel,
a residential tower, and an office tower. The project site is a 2.8 acre vacant parcel, which was the former site of the
original Boston Garden.
Hotel Market
Between 2000 and 2009, 25 hotels opened in the City, making up one-third of the current hotel stock.
Boston’s favorable hotel market and the decision to build the BCEC stimulated considerable new development over
this period. Two hotels opened in 2009: the 114-room Ames Hotel, an adaptive reuse of an historic office building
near Government Center, and the 235-room “W” Hotel in the Theater District. Two additional hotels opened in
2013: a 175 room Marriott Residence Inn in the Fenway/Kenmore district and a 120 room Marriott Residence Inn as
an adaptive reuse of the Stillings Building in South Boston, near the BCEC convention center. In 2015, three hotels
broke ground, including the Four Seasons at One Dalton Street near the Christian Science Plaza and the two D Street
hotels in South Boston. The Envoy and the Four Seasons both opened in 2015. The two D Street hotels, the Aloft
and Element, opened in February 2016, adding approximately 500 rooms across from the BCEC. Additionally, the
Godfrey hotel on Washington Street in Downtown Crossing opened in February 2016 adding 242 rooms. As of
December 2016, Boston had 82 hotels,2 with 70% rated as upper midscale or above, and a total of 19,817 hotel
rooms in establishments of fifty or more rooms.
In 2016 construction began on a hotel at Seaport Square Block J and the South Boston Boutique Hotel.
Construction also commenced at the AC Hotel, a European “select-service” style hotel with 200 rooms, and the
Moxy Hotel, a 346 room “micro” hotel in Downtown. The BPDA board approved three other major hotel projects in
2016; the Haymarket Hotel, Chain Forge, and the Harbinger Hotel.
The average occupancy rate of hotels in Boston was 77.7% over the past 10 years, according to the latest
data from the Pinnacle Perspective Monthly Report. The occupancy rate dipped in 2009 with the Recession, but
soon recovered, growing at an average annual rate of 2.0% and reaching 81.2% in 2016. Excluding the recession
years, these statistics suggest that Boston is a robust hotel market.
The City’s Average Daily Rate (“ADR”) represents the average rate paid per room sold over a given period
of time. The ADR is highly correlated with the occupancy rate, which follows the same trend but on a lagged basis.
The ADR, in fixed 2016 dollars, grew 17.2% from $218.08 in 1990 to $255.51 in 2016. The hotel room inventory
was smaller in 1990 than today, but the new hotels built after the 1990s added to the upper scale inventory with
higher daily rates and increased demand for hotel stays also drove up the ADR. The table below shows the room
supply, occupancy rate, ADR, and revenue per available room for Boston for the years 1990, 2000, and 2005
through 2016. The hotel industry provided 11,376 direct jobs in Boston for 2015, accounting for 1.9% of Boston’s
total payroll jobs, and 32.3% of Massachusetts’ hotel industry employment.

The Hotel stock is based on 2017 City of Boston Licensing Board data. In 2016, three hotels opened and two properties initially categorized as
lodging houses or bed & breakfast were reclassified as hotels, resulting in a total count of 82 hotels.

Transportation
Boston is a major national and international air terminus, a seaport, and the center of New England’s rail,
truck and bus service. The City is served by three limited-access interstate highways: I- 90 (the “Massachusetts
Turnpike”), which leads westward from downtown Boston 138 miles to the New York State border; I- 95, the East
Coast’s principal north-south highway, which connects Boston to Portland, Maine to the north and New York City
and Washington, D.C. to the south; and I- 93, another north-south interstate highway, that extends from just south of
the City north to New Hampshire.
Transportation planning includes both major highway and mass transit programs. The Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority (“MBTA”) provides commuter rail, subway, local bus and express bus services to 175
cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts, offering public transit to a population of almost 4.8 million people in an
area of 3,240 square miles. The MBTA, the fifth largest mass transit system in the nation as determined by ridership,
currently provides 1.3 million unlinked passenger trips per day.
Since the MBTA Draft Capital Investment Program (“CIP”) fiscal 2017-fiscal 2021 was not available at the
time of publishing, the data below are from the MBTA’s single year fiscal 2016 CIP. The CIP consists of six major
programmatic areas: (i) infrastructure investment; (ii) accessibility improvements; (iii) system enhancement; (iv)
system expansion efforts; (v) statewide transportation improvements; and (vi) state of good repair. The major
infrastructure projects for fiscal 2016 include: vehicles ($225.9 million); stations and facilities ($103.8 million); rail
signaling systems ($54.6 million); track/right-of-way ($55.1 million); bridges and tunnels ($57.4 million);
technology ($14.3 million); power ($46.7 million) and communications ($9.9 million). While overall enhancement
and expansion funding for fiscal 2016 is $427.2 million. Boston’s South Station, one of three major high speed rail
terminals on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor (“NEC”), currently hosts high speed intercity passenger rail (“HSIPR”),
including Amtrak Acela Express and Northeast Regional services. It is also the terminus for Amtrak’s Lake Shore
Limited service between Boston and Chicago. The MBTA also operates commuter rail, subway, and guideway bus
services at the station. The station’s Bus Terminal is the hub for private intercity and regional motor coach carriers
in eastern Massachusetts.
The State Transportation Improvement Program (“STIP”) is a federally mandated prioritized listing of
highway, bridge, intermodal and transit projects expected to be undertaken during the next four federal fiscal years.
The document is a compilation of those state, regional and local transportation priorities funded by the Federal
Highway Administration (“FHWA”) and the Federal Transit Administration (“FTA”), and must be financiallyconstrained to the federal amounts allocated to Massachusetts. The project lists are updated annually and include
projects programmed by the state’s ten metropolitan planning organizations (“MPOs”) and the three non-MPOs.
There are several Boston-based projects listed in fiscal 2017 – fiscal 2021 STIP including improvements along Blue
Hill Avenue and Warren Streets, reconstruction of Melnea Cass Boulevard, improvements to Boylston Street,
12

repairs to the North Washington Street Bridge, signal and intersection improvements at the intersection of the VFW
parkway and Spring Street, reconstruction of Rutherford Avenue from City Square to Sullivan Square, and traffic
signal improvements at ten locations across the city. MBTA capital improvements within Boston include the
following projects: the Fairmount Line Improvements, State Street and Orient Heights Station accessibility
improvements, Light Rail Accessibility Project (LRAP) improvements, and new vehicles for the Red and Orange
subway lines.
Seaport and Airport
The Massachusetts Port Authority (“Massport”) was created by the state legislature to develop and manage
the City’s major air and sea transportation centers. Massport is financially independent, and the City is not
responsible for any debt or other obligations incurred by Massport. Heavy use of Boston Logan International Airport
(“Logan Airport”) and the Port of Boston have compelled significant expansion of both facilities. Massport’s net
investment in Boston’s port facilities for ongoing and proposed projects, according to its fiscal year 2016 through
2020 Capital Program, is projected to be $1.27 billion in airport projects and $260.2 million in maritime
development and other capital projects.
The Port of Boston serves the six-state New England region as a natural deep-water port supporting import
and export of containerized bulk and general cargo. The port also provides ship repair supply services, customs and
international freight forwarding services, intermodal cargo warehouse facilities, and other maritime support services.
Massport’s Conley Container Terminal provides containerized freight water access to other container terminals
across the world. The Port of Boston is also a major cruise port. The cruise terminal served 309,027 passengers in
2016, a decrease of 5.9% compared to 2015. The cruise port mainly operates in the months of April through
November.
The Port of Boston ranked as the 14th largest container port on the U.S. Atlantic Coast by container
volume. The Port handled 24,329 boxed containers in FY2016, an increase of 12 percent over FY2015, and includes
imports, exports, and empties.3 The port also handled 53,854 automobiles in 2016, a decrease of 10% from 2015.
Additionally, the port handled 9.6 million bulk metric tons in 2014, which is a 3% decrease from 2013’s bulk
tonnage.
In 2016, Logan Airport served a total of 36.3 million domestic and international passengers, an 8.5%
increase from the 33.4 million passengers served in 2015. Logan Airport also plays an important role as a center for
processing domestic and international air cargo. In 2016, total combined cargo and mail volume was 279,836 metric
tons, a 7.1% increase from the 261,170 metric tons handled in 2015.
Construction Activity
The following table provides annual building permit revenues and an estimate of construction activity in
the City for fiscal years 2006 to 2016. Building permits issued do not necessarily result in construction activity. The
estimated revenue from building permit fees during fiscal year 2016 indicated the potential for $6.15 billion in
construction activity compared to an estimate of $6.16 billion for fiscal year 2015. Between 2015 and 2016, building
permit revenue remained mostly flat in fixed terms, but grew slightly in nominal terms.

Large Public Sector Projects
Boston has witnessed several other major public sector projects in recent years including the original BCEC
Project, the Central Artery Tunnel - a downtown highway tunnel through the city, and the Callahan Tunnel
Rehabilitation Project. Currently there are a number of ongoing and proposed projects spread across downtown and
into Boston’s neighborhoods. The list of large public projects below is not comprehensive, but highlights some
unique projects covering transportation and other major infrastructure.
The Casey Arborway Project construction began in February 2015, with full closure of the Casey overpass
in May 2015 for demolition. The project, located at Forest Hills Station in Jamaica Plain, will reconnect and
simplify roadways, improve bicycle and pedestrian access, and include station improvements to Forest Hills. For
this large redevelopment MassDOT partnered with the City of Boston, Department of Conservation and Recreation
(“DCR”), and the MBTA. Full beneficial use of the Arborway is expected in Fall 2017, with completion in Spring
2018.
The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (“MWRA”), an independent state authority has also spent
over $8.0 billion on capital improvements, including the Boston Harbor Project, since its inception. The MWRA’s
FY2017 Capital Improvements Program enumerates five major initiatives: the Boston Harbor Program, the
MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel, the Carroll Water Treatment Plant, the Combined Sewer Overflow Control Plan,
and Covered Storage facilities. To date the MWRA has spent $6.0 billion on these five initiatives, with the Boston
Harbor project being the most expensive at $3.8 billion.
The Community Preservation Act (the “CPA”), which passed in November 2016, will help the City of
Boston achieve its housing and economic goals by generating revenue that is specifically allocated to creating
affordable housing units, restoring parks and recreational open space, and preserving historical sites. Through a one
percent surcharge on real property tax, Boston is expected to receive an estimated $20 million per year, which
includes a $4 million match from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue through the Community Preservation
Trust Fund. A committee of five to nine members will make recommendations to Boston’s City Council on CPA
projects that fall into the three CPA eligible project categories.
Office Market and New Development
The City and its neighborhoods have approximately 66.4 million square feet of office space. During the
fourth quarter of 2016, Boston’s direct vacancy rate was 7.5%, according to realty firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).
Boston’s annual net absorption of office space was 1.2 million square feet. Compared to this time last year (fourth
quarter of 2015), these figures have remained relatively unchanged. For certain areas within Boston however,
leasing activity has become more robust. Charlestown, Fenway, and Back Bay have significantly higher absorption

14

rates and lower vacancy rates than last year. The average asking rent citywide for 2016 was $56.02, which remains
competitive as it is, on average, $10 less per square foot than the tighter Cambridge office market.

The following developments were completed in 2015 and 2016. In May 2015, Converse opened its new
world headquarters on Boston’s Lovejoy Wharf. The 214,000-square-foot headquarters is located at 160 North
Washington Street. In October 2015, PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) moved from the Financial District in Boston
into its new location at 101 Seaport Boulevard in the South Boston Waterfront's Innovation District. Construction on
the 17-story 440,000 square foot office building in Seaport Square began in 2013. PwC signed a 15-year lease for
333,000 square feet in the building for its 3,000 Boston employees.
A 17-story mixed use office building in the Back Bay at 888 Boylston Street was completed in September
2016. The project includes approximately 422,000 square feet, of which 362,000 square feet is allocated to office
and another 60,000 square feet for retail. This new building will be the fourth office building in the Prudential
complex. Other major projects that have seen construction start include Congress Square, a project that reinvents
five iconic and interconnected buildings in Downtown to create a contemporary urban campus over a full city block.
Pier 4 Phase 2, a 15-story office tower with ground floor retail, and Fan Pier Parcel I, a 17-story office headquarters
for Goodwin Procter, also began construction in 2016.
The oval-shaped 121 Seaport Boulevard tower will break up a series of rectangular-shaped buildings in the
South Boston Waterfront. The building’s rounded shape intends to maximize views of Boston Harbor. Ground-floor
retail will complement office spaces in the remainder of the building, and future tenants are not yet known. In 2016,
the BPDA approved 13 projects that include new office space, for a total of over 1.9 million new square feet of
office space. The approved buildings will be mixed-use, with six including residential space. The new office
developments will be located across the city: four in South Boston Waterfront, two each in South Boston and
Roxbury, and one each in Brighton, Chinatown, Dorchester, Downtown, and the South End. Among these newlyapproved projects is the GE headquarters in Fort Point, the New John Hancock building at 380 Stuart, and a 13-story
office building in the South Boston Waterfront’s Parcel Q1.
Retail Market
For 2015, there were 94,052 employees in retail trade, and accommodation and food services in Boston,
with 34,142 in retail, and 59,910 in accommodation and food services. The retail sector is also complemented by an
estimated 21,980 employees in personal services businesses, which include such services as repair and maintenance,
hair and nail care, and laundry and dry cleaning service. According to the 2012 Economic Census, about 2,161 retail
establishments were located in the City with estimated total sales of $8.24 billion in 2016 dollars. The food service
and eating and drinking establishment industry in Boston (restaurants and bars) consists of an
additional 2,176 establishments with $3 billion in sales.

There are now 20 neighborhood business districts operating within the City’s Main Streets Program. This
program is a public-private initiative of the City established in 1995 to revitalize neighborhood commercial districts
through locally established organizations. In fiscal 2016, 106 new and expanded businesses opened in Main Streets
districts, creating 596 new jobs. Business assistance was provided to 1,877 small businesses. Four hundred and
thirty-four special district promotional events generated over 32,000 volunteer hours and the local Main Streets
Districts storefront occupancy rates were an average of 94%.
The retail real estate market in 2016 remained strong. According to CoStar, Boston’s vacancy rate for
2016 was 2.5%. Retail rents were strong, particularly in the Downtown core and immediate surrounding areas.
Quoted retail rental rates were $32.56 per square foot for 2016. Large retail projects began construction in 2015 and
2016. In 2015, Seaport Square Blocks B&C started construction. The two buildings on the site will each contain
three stories of retail, including entertainment and restaurant spaces. Once complete, the development will also
include publicly accessible pedestrian access to the Courthouse Silver Line bus stop.
Important market and supermarket developments have taken place throughout Boston’s neighborhoods.
Twenty-four new or expanded supermarkets have opened in Boston’s neighborhoods since 1992. The Boston Public
Market, a year-round market featuring fresh, locally sourced food opened in 2015 on Hanover Street. The market
features over 38 vendors. A Whole Foods Market opened in the South End on the second week of January 2015. The
expanded tropical foods market in Roxbury and the Roche Brothers in Downtown Crossing also both opened in
2015. Additionally, Bfresh opened in Brighton in August of 2016. There are currently 54 supermarkets in Boston,
with several more projects underway. Among the projects currently under construction, there is a 60,000 square
foot Star Market at the Hub on Causeway at TD Garden. Once complete, this Star Market will be Boston’s largest

Industrial Market and Recent Developments
The Boston/Suffolk County sub-market has approximately 26.3 million square feet of industrial space
and 6.67 million square feet of flex space according to CoStar. The vacancy rates at the end of 2016 were
approximately 5% for industrial and 5.6% for flex. The average asking rent for industrial was $12.25 per square foot
NNN (“Net-Net-Net”, or net property tax, insurance, and maintenance), and $22.14 per square foot NNN for flex.
Since 2014, rental rates for industrial have increased 10% and flex increased by 27%.
The Raymond L. Flynn Marine Park, formerly the Boston Marine Industrial Park, consists of over three
million square feet of developed real estate. The Park hosts small scale high tech manufacturing, a new innovation
workshop attached to a recently announced AutoDesk office, and an array of small manufacturing firms located in
the Innovation and Design Building. In addition, BMIP is also home to MassChallenge, an annual $1 million global
startup competition and accelerator. Several acres of maritime and industrial parcels are available with multiple
suitors in conversation with EDIC. Recently, J.C. Cannistraro, a HVAC and fire suppression manufacturer, has
leased parcel N, and is being redeveloped into a state of the art manufacturing and warehouse facility. In spring
2017, a 200,000 square foot seafood processing facility is expected to break ground for Stavis Seafood on the North
Jetty. Additionally, the BPDA has approved of a 215,000 office building in parcel Q1 and 415-room hotel on parcel
A.

Housing Stock, Housing Values, and Development
There were 286,120 housing units in Boston according to the 2015 ACS. Of the 261,492 occupied units, 34.1%
were owner-occupied and 65.9% were renter-occupied. Vacant housing units totaled 24,628 while the homeowner
unit vacancy rate was 1.2% and the rental unit vacancy rate was 2.2%. The 2015 ACS showed that the median
monthly cost for home owners with a mortgage was $2,237 and the gross monthly rent (for existing renters rather
than advertised rents) was $1,423. Gross rents are what tenants pay out of their pocket and the availability of public
and subsidized housing makes this value much lower than advertised market rents for newly available units.
Preliminary data for 2016 real estate trends were provided by the City’s Department of Neighborhood
Development. These data show that the median rent for an apartment in Boston as advertised by the Multiple Listing
Service (“MLS”) was $2,430 per month for all apartment sizes and types between the fourth quarter of 2015 and the
third quarter of 2016, the most recent data available. The citywide median advertised rents in this sample were
unchanged compared to the previous four quarters, but many neighborhoods nonetheless saw percent increases in
median rent. Median rents for an apartment in Boston’s neighborhoods ranged from a high of $2,895 in the central
planning district (comprising Downtown, the North End, the West End, and the Waterfront) to a low of $1,700 in
Hyde Park.

Medians or percentages with a sample size of less than ten are not reliable.
Note 1:
The prices in the above table exempt all sales of properties of less than $25,000 because the low price sales are not considered to be
“arms-length” transactions.
Note 2:
Data in the above table do not include “paired-sales” so the size, quality and type of houses sold vary from year-to-year.
Note 3:
Sales volume eliminates those sales mentioned in note 1 and also eliminate sales for properties that were not able to be accurately geocoded for location so actual neighborhood and citywide totals are higher.

Condominium sales volume and prices also showed variability across the neighborhoods of Boston in 2015
and 2016. The three most expensive neighborhoods for condominiums were the Central neighborhood (comprising

The prices in the above table exempt all sales of properties of less than $25,000 because the low price sales are not considered to be
“arms-length” transactions.
Data in the above table do not include “paired-sales,” so the size, quality and type of houses sold vary from year-to-year.
Sales volume eliminates those sales mentioned in note 1 and also eliminate sales for properties that were not able to be accurately
“geo-coded” for location so actual neighborhood and citywide totals are higher.
The median sales prices for condominiums in Mattapan in 2015 primarily reflects sales of higher end units located in the 1241-1251
Adams Street development.
City of Boston, Department of Neighborhood Development using Banker & Tradesman data, January 2017.

When housing prices began to fall and sales volume slackened following 2005, foreclosure deeds rose
through 2008, peaking at 1,215, while petitions to foreclose (the first step in the foreclosure process) peaked at 2,432
in 2007.4 Since then, foreclosure deeds have remained significantly lower than the peak, however, they have
increased in each of the three past years. In 2016 foreclosure deeds increased to 164, up from 124 in 2015. Petitions
to foreclose rose slightly from 2015 to 2016, a change from 526 to 533.
In the third quarter of 2016, 1,565 new or converted housing units were permitted for construction in the
City. This represents the largest number of new units permitted in a single quarter since record keeping began 20
years ago.5 In 2016, the BPDA Board approved 7.9 million square feet of new housing, for a total of 7,868 new
housing units across the City. Of these units, 1,661 are affordable units. While new housing projects were scattered
across the city, the largest projects by number of units include M Block in Seaport Square (735 units), Washington
Village in South Boston (656 units), and the Government Center Garage residential project (486 units).
The Boston Housing Authority (“BHA”) is the largest public housing authority in New England and sixth
in the nation. The agency provides subsidized housing to low and moderate income individuals and families. The
Authority owns and operates 63 family and elderly and disabled developments that are home to more than 25,000
residents. Most of the 12,600 households in BHA housing have extremely low-income, averaging $14,000 per year.
BHA also administers Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8 or leased housing) to over 11,000 families that lease
apartments from private landlords. The BHA helps provide housing to approximately 33,000 people under these
programs.6
BHA’s Five-Year Agency Plan set forth new goals and strategies to develop property-by-property to ensure
the long-term sustainability of its public housing communities. Agency initiatives consider the severe and persistent
funding shortfalls in the federal public housing program, and identified several housing developments with high
potential for accessing capital and operating resources outside of the conventional public housing program. These

developments are Bunker Hill in Charlestown, Amory Street in Jamaica Plain, Lenox/Camden in Roxbury, and West
Newton in the South End. BHA’s goal is to preserve the deeply affordable units that exist at the sites today while,
where feasible, adding new moderate-income and market-rate housing units to create vibrant mixed-income
communities. In 2015, BHA completed construction on 40 new affordable units as part of the Old Colony public
housing development in South Boston. This brings the total units completed over the past five years to 285,
representing almost half of the Old Colony units planned for redevelopment. In addition, BHA recently received a
$30 million Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grant to rebuild the Whittier Street housing development in
Lower Roxbury. The current Whitter Street complex, built in 1953, is one of BHA’s oldest, and the HUD grant will
facilitate upgrades and expansion.
The Linkage Program
The City implemented its development linkage program in 1983 in order to direct some of the benefits of
downtown investment to the building of affordable housing in its neighborhoods through the Neighborhood Housing
Trust (“NHT”). The linkage program also funds job training for City residents through the Neighborhood Jobs Trust
(“NJT”). Under the linkage program, which was amended in 1986, 2001, and again in 2013, real estate developers
seeking approval of large scale commercial or institutional developments are required to enter into agreements to
pay exactions in the amount of $10.01 per square-foot of non-residential construction over 100,000 square feet, of
which $1.67 per square-foot goes to the job training fund and $8.34 per square-foot goes for affordable housing
purposes. The fee was last adjusted as of October 17, 2013.
Since the inception of the linkage program through December 2016, the NHT has awarded approximately
$168.9 million in grant funds. The NHT funding contributed to the construction, pending construction, or renovation
of 13,938 housing units of which 11,914 units are affordable. The NHT funding represents 5% of the combined
development cost of all assisted projects. NHT grant awards are allocated to fund low and moderate-income housing
through the renovation of old buildings and schools and the construction of new housing. Projects have included
rental developments of family-sized units, single room occupancy units, units set aside for homeless or formerly
homeless households, elderly housing units, and units exclusively for other special needs populations. In addition,
the NHT grants support the development of housing ownership opportunities in condominiums, housing
cooperatives, and single-family homes.
NJT supports innovative education and training activities leading to high wage employment, new or nontraditional employment opportunities, and community-based projects that respond to specific neighborhoods’
education and training needs. The NJT is committed to providing appropriate services to the residents of
neighborhoods where, or adjacent to where, a given development project is located, while also ensuring that
residents throughout the City have access to new jobs resulting from development.
In fiscal 2016, the NJT committed $1.2 million to job training services to serve unemployed or
underemployed lower- skilled individuals with multiples barriers to employment. Seventeen community- based job
training programs were funded, including Hospitality, Administration, Construction, Culinary/Food Service, Retail
banking/ Financial Services Sectors, Certified Nursing Assistant/Home Health Aide, Early Childhood Education,
Human Services, Certified licensed Drivers, Security, Information Technology, Building Maintenance, Customer
Service and an Occupational Skills Training with ESOL for Supermarket Employment. fiscal 2016 programming
started in March 2016 and will continue through the Spring of 2017. So far in fiscal 2016, NJT funds served a total
of 242 adults in the City of Boston, and at least 47% have at least one barrier to employment including; CORI,
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Housing Vouchers or have been homeless or near homeless. At the end
of the grant cycle in spring 2017, over 80% are expected to complete the training programs and 70% of participants
will secure full-time training related positions. In the previous year (fiscal 2015), 336 Boston residents were served,
and 90% of participants completed the training programs. Upon securing employment, the average hourly wage for
participants was $14.90, with 83% of participants having access to benefits.

PROPOSED FORM OF LEGAL OPINION

APPENDIX B

June 12, 2017

David Sweeney, Chief Financial Officer
and Collector-Treasurer
City of Boston
Boston, Massachusetts
$58,370,000
Re: City of Boston, Massachusetts
General Obligation Refunding Bonds, 2017 Series B
We have acted as Bond Counsel to the City of Boston, Massachusetts (the “City”), in connection
with the issuance by the City of $58,370,000 General Obligation Bonds, 2017 Series B (the
“Bonds”) dated the date hereof. In such capacity, we have examined the law and such certified
proceedings and other papers as we have deemed necessary to render this opinion.
As to questions of fact material to our opinion we have relied upon representations and
covenants of the City contained in the certified proceedings and other certifications of public
officials furnished to us, without undertaking to verify the same by independent investigation.
Based on this examination, we are of the opinion, under existing law, as follows:
(1)
The Bonds are valid and binding general obligations of the City and, except to the
extent they are paid from other sources, the principal of and interest on the Bonds are payable
from taxes which may be levied without limitation as to rate or amount upon all taxable property
in the City.
(2)
Interest on the Bonds is excluded from the gross income of the owners of the
Bonds for federal income tax purposes. In addition, interest on the Bonds is not a specific
preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes.
However, such interest is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate
alternative minimum taxable income. In rendering the opinions set forth in this paragraph, we
have assumed compliance by the City with all requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 that must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that interest thereon
be, and continue to be, excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The City
has covenanted to comply with all such requirements. Failure by the City to comply with certain
of such requirements may cause the interest on the Bonds to become included in gross income
B-1

for federal income tax purposes retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds. We express no
opinion regarding any other federal tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds.
(3)
The interest on the Bonds is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes
and the Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property taxes. We express no opinion
regarding any other Massachusetts tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds or any tax
consequences arising with respect to the Bonds under the laws of any state other than
Massachusetts.
This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we neither assume nor undertake any
obligation to update, revise, supplement or restate this opinion to reflect any action taken or
omitted, or any facts or circumstances or changes in law or in the interpretation thereof, that may
hereafter arise or occur, or for any other reason.
The rights of the holders of the Bonds and the enforceability of the Bonds may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’
rights heretofore or hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable, and their
enforcement may also be subject to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases.
