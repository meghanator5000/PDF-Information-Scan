In the opinion of Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge LLP, Bond Counsel, based upon an analysis of existing law and assuming, among other
matters, compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds is excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Interest on the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the
Series D Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes, although such
interest is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable income. In the opinion of Bond Counsel, under existing law, interest on the Series C Bonds is included in gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes under
the Code. Under existing law, interest on all of the Bonds is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the Bonds are exempt from
Massachusetts personal property taxes. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or
disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds. See “Tax Exemption” herein.

CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS

$86,190,000
GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS, 2011 SERIES A
$38,295,000
GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS, 2011 SERIES B
$41,620,000

GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS, 2011 SERIES D

This Official Statement (which includes the cover page and Appendices hereto) provides information
concerning the City of Boston, Massachusetts (the “City”), and the $86,190,000 General Obligation Bonds, 2011
Series A (the “Series A Bonds”), $38,295,000 General Obligation Bonds, 2011 Series B (the “Series B Bonds”),
$41,620,000 General Obligation Bonds, 2011 Series C (Qualified School Construction Bonds – Federally Taxable –
Direct Payment), and the $14,425,000 General Obligation Bonds, 2011 Series D (the “Series D Bonds,” and together
with the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the Series C Bonds, the “Bonds”), to be issued by the City as
described herein. Certain credit factors concerning the Bonds are described throughout this Official Statement,
which should be read in its entirety. This Official Statement speaks only as of its date and the information contained
herein is subject to change after this date.
THE CITY
The City of Boston, incorporated as a town in 1630 and as a city in 1822, is the largest city in Massachusetts
and the capital of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Commonwealth”). The City and its component
governmental units are responsible for the provision of a wide range of government services, including education,
public safety, public health, urban planning and development and the maintenance of the City’s infrastructure, and
for funding certain employee benefits, state authority assessments and debt service requirements. Its primary sources
of revenue are property taxes, state aid and certain excises. Management of the City’s finances includes preparation
of annual operating and capital budgets, the exercise of expenditure controls and cash management. For a full
discussion concerning the City and its finances, see “Appendix A—City of Boston, Massachusetts, Information
Statement Dated March 1, 2011 (the “Information Statement”).
As the economic hub of New England, Boston is a center for professional, financial, higher educational and
medical services, and the focus of tourist and convention travel in New England. For a description of certain
demographic and economic information about the City, see “Appendix A—Exhibit III—City of Boston—Selected
Demographic and Economic Information.”
SECURITY FOR THE BONDS
The Bonds will be valid general obligations of the City, for the payment of the principal of and interest on
which the full faith and credit of the City will be pledged. To the extent not paid from other legally available
revenues of the City, the Bonds are payable from ad valorem taxes which may be levied upon all taxable property in
the City without limit as to rate or amount.
Chapter 643 of the Acts of 1983 of the Commonwealth, as amended (the “Bond Procedure Act of 1983”),
requires that the debt and interest charges on all general obligation indebtedness of the City (including the Bonds), if
not otherwise provided for, be included in the City’s annual tax levy. The Bond Procedure Act of 1983 also
mandates assessment of taxes in excess of the levy limits imposed by the statewide property tax limit (“Proposition
2½”) to the extent that the debt service on City obligations is not otherwise provided for in the tax levy or from other
sources, with no allowance made for any other expenditures of the City. See “City Revenues—Property Taxes—
Proposition 2½” in the Information Statement. Holders of City obligations do not have a statutory priority with
respect to or a security interest in the portion of the tax levy attributable to such obligations. See “City
Indebtedness—Classification of City Debt” in the Information Statement.
In the opinion of Bond Counsel, the City is subject to suit on the Bonds, and courts of competent jurisdiction
have power in appropriate proceedings to order payment of a judgment on the Bonds from available funds or, in the
absence of available funds, to order the inclusion of the required amount in the next annual tax levy. In exercising
their discretion as to whether to enter such an order, the courts could take into account all relevant factors, including
the current operating needs of the City and the availability and adequacy of other remedies. The Massachusetts
1

Supreme Judicial Court has stated in the past that a judgment against a municipality can be enforced by the taking
and sale of property of any inhabitant. There has been no judicial determination, however, as to whether the remedy
is constitutional under current due process and equal protection standards.
Payment of the principal and interest on the Bonds is not secured by or limited to a pledge of any particular
revenue source of the City. Chapter 190 of the Acts of 1982 of the Commonwealth (the “1982 Funding Loan Act”)
and the Bond Procedure Act of 1983 authorize the City to pledge to the payment of any of its general obligation
notes or bonds all or any part of the revenues of the City derived from any tax, fee, distribution or reimbursement
payable to the City (except distributions and reimbursements required by law to be specifically used for statutorily
defined purposes), including state aid distributions and the proceeds of the City’s annual property tax levy. No
obligations are currently outstanding which are secured by such a pledge. The Bond Procedure Act of 1983 also
authorizes the City to issue special obligation bonds payable solely from the revenues of a revenue-producing
facility. The only special obligation indebtedness of the City that was outstanding as of March 1, 2011 that is
payable solely from such revenues was $73.1 million of the City’s Special Obligation Refunding Bonds, Boston
City Hospital Issue. See “City Indebtedness—Special Obligation Debt” in the Information Statement. To the extent
required for the payment of any such indebtedness, the revenues pledged to their payment would not be available to
pay the Bonds.
Chapter 152 of the Acts of 1997, as amended (the “Convention Center Act”), also authorizes the City to
pledge certain excise receipts and other revenues of the City to the payment of special obligation bonds of the City
issued under the authority of the Convention Center Act. The only indebtedness of the City that was outstanding
under the Convention Center Act as of March 1, 2011 was $93.5 million of the City’s Convention Center Loan, Act
of 1997, Special Obligation Bonds, Series A. Proceeds of the Series B Bonds and other funds available to the City
will be applied on the date of delivery of the Series B Bonds to advance refund all of such bonds and the pledge of
such excise receipts and other revenues for the benefit of such bonds will be released and discharged on that date.
See “Plan of Refunding” below and “City Indebtedness—Special Obligation Debt” in the Information Statement.
Except to the extent specifically pledged to the payment of certain indebtedness, state aid distributions to the
City are generally available for the payment of bonds or notes of the City, but, under certain circumstances, they
may be unavailable to the extent such distributions are applied to the payment of “qualified bonds” issued by the
City (none of which are currently outstanding), or to the extent that such distributions may be applied under state
law to the satisfaction of unpaid assessments due the Commonwealth from the City for debt issued by the
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, or for obligations of the City or of the Boston Water and Sewer
Commission issued to the Massachusetts Water Pollution Abatement Trust. See “City Indebtedness—Classification
of City Debt” in the Information Statement.
State statutes also provide that certain parking meter receipts may be used only for parking and related
purposes and, accordingly, monies derived from this source may be unavailable to pay general obligation bonds and
notes issued for other purposes. In addition, subject to certain limits, the City may annually authorize the
establishment of one or more revolving funds in connection with the use of certain revenues for programs that
produce those revenues. If it accepts certain statutory provisions, the City may also establish enterprise funds for
certain purposes, including for a health care, solid waste, recreational or transportation facility, and for police or fire
services. Under those provisions any surplus in the fund is restricted to use for capital expenditures or reduction of
user charges. The City has not established any such revolving funds or enterprise funds.
Section 19A of Chapter 44 of the General Laws provides, in part, that if the City is or is likely to be unable to
pay principal of or interest on any of its bonds or notes when due, it shall notify the state Commissioner of Revenue.
The Commissioner shall certify such inability to the State Treasurer. The State Treasurer shall pay the due or
overdue amount by the later of three days after the certification or one business day prior to the due date. This
payment is limited, however, to the estimated amounts distributable by the Commonwealth to the City during the
remainder of the fiscal year. If, for any reason, any portion of the certified sum has not been paid at the end of the
fiscal year, the State Treasurer shall pay it as soon as practicable in the next fiscal year to the extent of the estimated
distributions for such fiscal year. The sums so paid shall be charged with interest and administrative costs against the
distributions to the City. The foregoing provisions are not a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth. The
Commonwealth has not agreed to maintain existing levels of state distributions and the law requiring the
Commonwealth to use estimated distributions to pay debt service may be subject to repeal by future legislation.
Moreover, adoption of the Commonwealth’s annual appropriation act is often delayed beyond the beginning of the
fiscal year, and estimated distributions which are subject to appropriation may be unavailable to pay local debt
service until they are appropriated.

2

The rights of the holders of the Bonds and the enforceability of payment of the Bonds may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights heretofore or
hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable and their enforcement may also be subject to the exercise
of judicial discretion in appropriate cases. Massachusetts municipalities are not currently authorized by the
Massachusetts General Laws to file a petition for bankruptcy under Federal Bankruptcy laws.
THE BONDS
Description
The Bonds will be dated their respective dates of delivery shown on the front cover of this Official Statement
and will mature on April 1 of the years, and in the amounts, and will bear interest calculated on the basis of 30-day
months and a 360-day year at the rates, shown on the inside front cover of this Official Statement. Interest on the
Bonds will be payable on October 1, 2011 and semiannually thereafter on each April 1 and October 1, provided that
if such day is not a business day, interest will be payable on the next business day,
The Bonds will be issued by means of a book-entry system, with bond certificates immobilized at The
Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). Bond certificates will not be available for distribution
to the public and will evidence ownership of the Bonds in principal amounts of $5,000 or integral multiples thereof,
with transfers of ownership effected on the records of DTC and its participants pursuant to rules and procedures
established by DTC and its participants. Interest on the Bonds will be paid on the interest payment dates or upon
redemption, and principal of the Bonds will be paid at maturity or upon redemption, to DTC or its nominee as
registered owner of the Bonds. Transfer of principal or redemption price and interest payments to participants of
DTC will be the responsibility of DTC; transfer of principal or redemption price and interest payments to beneficial
owners by participants of DTC will be the responsibility of such participants and other nominees of beneficial
owners. The record date for principal or redemption price and interest payments will be the fifteenth day of the
month next preceding a debt service payment date or, if such day is not a business day, the next succeeding business
day. The City will not be responsible or liable for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records maintained by
DTC, its participants or persons acting through such participants.
U.S. Bank National Association, Boston, Massachusetts, will act as paying agent for the Bonds (the “Paying
Agent”).
Authorization and Purpose
The Bonds will be issued pursuant to Chapter 643 of the Acts of 1983 of the Commonwealth, as amended, and
various loan orders of the City Council approved by the Mayor. The Series A Bonds will be issued to finance
various capital projects in the City. The Series B Bonds will be issued for the purpose of advance refunding the
City’s Convention Center Bonds as more fully described under “Plan of Refunding,” below. The Series C Bonds
will be issued to finance various school projects in the City. The Series D Bonds will be issued for the purpose of
currently refunding certain outstanding general obligation bonds of the City as more fully described herein under
“Plan of Refunding.”
Series C Bonds - Qualified School Construction Bonds—Direct Payment
The Series C Bonds will be designated by the City as “Qualified School Construction Bonds” under the
provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) and as defined in Section 54F of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The City also has elected to designate the Series C Bonds
as “specified tax credit bonds” as defined in Section 6431(f) of the Code. As a result of such election, the Series C
Bonds will bear interest which will be included in the gross income of holders thereof for federal income tax
purposes, and the holders will not be entitled to any federal tax credits otherwise applicable to Qualified School
Construction Bonds in connection with their holding of the Series C Bonds. The City will be entitled to receive cash
subsidies (“Interest Subsidy Payments”) from the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) equal
to the lesser of: (i) 100% of the interest payable on the Series C Bonds or (ii) the amount of the applicable tax credit
rate determined on the date of issuance of the Series C Bonds under Section 54A(b)(3) of the Code; provided that
the City makes certain required filings in accordance with applicable federal rules pertaining to the Interest Subsidy
Payments. Interest Subsidy Payments are treated as overpayments of tax, and accordingly are subject to offset
against certain amounts that may be owed by the City to the federal government or its agencies. In addition, it is
possible that the Interest Subsidy Payments could be reduced or eliminated or the timing of the payment thereof
altered as a result of a change in federal law. The Interest Subsidy Payments received by the City are not pledged to
pay the Series C Bonds, nor are their receipt a condition of payment of any portion of the principal of or interest on
the Series C Bonds. Federal tax law imposes certain requirements for qualification of the Series C Bonds as
3

Qualified School Construction Bonds. There can be no assurance that the Series C Bonds will qualify as Qualified
School Construction Bonds or as to the receipt, or timing of receipt, of Interest Subsidy Payments. The City is
obligated to make payments of the principal of and interest on the Series C Bonds whether or not it receives Interest
Subsidy Payments.
Redemption Prior To Maturity
Optional Redemption
The Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the Series C Bonds maturing on or before April 1, 2021 are not
subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option of the City. The Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the
Series C Bonds maturing after April 1, 2021 are subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option of the City, on
or after April 1, 2021, as a whole or in part at any time, in such order of maturity as the City may determine and by
lot within each maturity as selected by DTC and its participants, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount
of Series A Bonds, Series B Bonds or Series C Bonds to be redeemed, plus accrued interest to the redemption date.
The Series D Bonds are not subject to redemption at the option of the City prior to their stated dates of
maturity.
Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption – Series C Bonds
The Series C Bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, on April 1, 2014
or, in the event of an extension negotiated with the Internal Revenue Service, on an interest payment date that occurs
on or before April 1, 2016, in an amount equal to any unexpended proceeds of the Series C Bonds at such date, at a
redemption price equal to the principal amount of Series C Bonds to be redeemed, plus accrued interest to the
redemption date.

Notice of Redemption
Notice of redemption of Bonds, specifying the numbers, series and maturities of the Bonds or portions thereof
to be redeemed and the redemption date, will be given by the Paying Agent not less than 30 days prior to the
redemption date by notice mailed to DTC or its nominee, as registered owner of the Bonds to be redeemed. The City
will not be responsible for mailing notices of redemption to anyone other than DTC or its nominee. Notice having
been given, the Bonds or portions thereof called for redemption will become due and payable on the designated
redemption date. If on the redemption date monies are available for the redemption of the Bonds or portions thereof
to be redeemed, together with interest accrued to the redemption date, then interest on such Bonds or portions
thereof shall thereafter cease to accrue.
Book-Entry Transfer System
DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds. The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities
registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an
authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of each
series of the Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of that maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.
DTC, the world’s largest depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York
Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the
Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code,
and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and
municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct
Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales
and other securities transactions, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and
4

pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC, is the holding company for DTC, National, and
Securities Clearing Corporation, and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing
agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated securities. Access to the DTC system is also available to
others as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly
(“Indirect Participants”). DTC has Standard & Poor’s highest rating: AAA. The DTC Rules applicable to its
Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at
www.dtcc.com and www.dtc.org.
Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive
a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial
Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive
written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written
confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or
Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership
interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting
on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership
interests in the Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.
To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the
name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an authorized
representative of DTC. The deposit of the Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such
other DTC nominee do not affect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual
Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts
such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will
remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.
Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to
Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by
arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.
Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within a maturity of a series are being
deemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such maturity
to be redeemed.
Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the Bonds
unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI procedures. Under its usual procedures,
DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the City as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede
& Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Bonds are credited on the
record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).
Principal or redemption price and interest payments on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or such other
nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct
Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the City or the
Paying Agent on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments
by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the
case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the
responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC or, its nominee, the Paying Agent, or the City, subject to any
statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal or redemption price
and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is
the responsibility of the City or the Paying Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants shall be the
responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners shall be the responsibility of
Direct and Indirect Participants.
DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by
giving reasonable notice to the City or the Paying Agent. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor
securities depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered to DTC.
The City may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a
successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certificates will be printed and delivered.

Upon delivery of the Series B Bonds, the City will enter into a Refunding Escrow Agreement (the “Escrow
Agreement”) with U.S. Bank National Association, Boston, Massachusetts, as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”) to
provide for the payment of the Refunded Convention Center Bonds. Upon receipt of the proceeds of the Series B
Bonds, the City will transfer such proceeds, together with other funds available to the City in the amount of
$59,267,493.75, to the Escrow Agent for deposit in a Refunding Escrow Fund established under the Refunding
Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will invest such amounts in direct general obligations of, or obligations the
timely payment of principal and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of America
(“Governmental Obligations”) maturing in amounts and on dates, and bearing interest at rates, sufficient without
reinvestment to pay when due the principal of and interest payable on the Refunded Convention Center Bonds on
May 1, 2011, the interest payable on the Refunded Convention Center Bonds on November 1, 2011, and the
principal of and interest payable on all remaining outstanding Refunded Convention Center Bonds upon the
redemption of such bonds on May 1, 2012. The Refunding Escrow Fund, including the interest earnings on the
Government Obligations, is pledged for the benefit of the holders of the Refunded Convention Center Bonds.
The Arbitrage Group, Inc. will verify from information provided to them the mathematical accuracy as of the
date of the closing on the Series B Bonds of (i) the computation contained in the provided schedules to determine
that the anticipated receipts from the Government Obligations and cash deposits, to be held in escrow, will be
sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of and interest on the Refunded Convention Center Bonds, and (ii) the
computation of yield on the Government Obligations contained in provided schedules used by Bond Counsel in its
determination that the interest on the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds is excluded from
gross income for federal income tax purposes. The Arbitrage Group, Inc. will express no opinion on the assumptions
provided to them, nor as to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of the interest on the
Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, or the Series D Bonds.

Series D Bonds
The proceeds of the Series D Bonds, together with other funds available to the City, will be applied to
currently refund $15,365,000 aggregate principal amount of the City's General Obligation Bonds 2001 Series B,
dated April 1, 2001, maturing on August 1 in the years and in the principal amounts, bearing interest at the rates and

LITIGATION
No litigation is pending or, to the knowledge of the City’s Corporation Counsel, threatened (a) seeking to
restrain or enjoin the issuance or delivery of the Bonds, (b) contesting or affecting any authority for or the validity of
the Bonds, (c) contesting the power of the City to issue the Bonds or the power of the City to offer and sell the
Bonds to the Underwriter, (d) contesting the power of the City to levy and collect taxes to pay the Bonds (e)
contesting the corporate existence or boundaries of the City, or (f) contesting the title of officials of the City who
have acted with respect to the proceedings for the issuance and sale of the Bonds to their respective offices.
There are pending in courts within the Commonwealth various suits in which the City is a defendant. No
litigation is pending or threatened which is likely to result, either individually or in the aggregate, in final judgments
against the City which would affect materially its ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds when due
or which would affect materially its financial condition.
TAX MATTERS
Series A Bonds, Series B Bonds, and Series D Bonds
In the opinion of Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge LLP, Bond Counsel to the City (“Bond Counsel”), based
upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings, and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters,
compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds is
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the “Code”). Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds,
and the Series D Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate
alternative minimum taxes, although Bond Counsel observes that such interest is included in adjusted current
earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable income. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion
regarding any other federal tax consequences arising with respect to the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual
or receipt of interest on, the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds.
The Code imposes various requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax
purposes of interest on obligations such as the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds. Failure
to comply with these requirements may result in interest on the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, or the Series D
Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of
the Series A Bonds the Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds. The City has covenanted to comply with such
requirements to ensure that interest on the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds will not be
included in federal gross income. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes compliance with these requirements.
Bond Counsel is also of the opinion that, under existing law, interest on the Series A Bonds, the Series B
Bonds, and the Series D Bonds is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the Series A Bonds, the
Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property taxes. Bond Counsel has
not opined as to other Massachusetts tax consequences arising with respect to the Series A Bonds, the Series B
Bonds, and the Series D Bonds. Prospective Bondholders should be aware, however, that the Series A Bonds, the
Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds are included in the measure of Massachusetts estate and inheritance taxes,
8

and the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds and the interest thereon are included in the
measure of certain Massachusetts corporate excise and franchise taxes. Bond Counsel has not opined as to the
taxability of the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds or the income therefrom under the
laws of any state other than Massachusetts.
A complete copy of the proposed form of the opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to the Series A Bonds, the
Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds is set forth in Appendix B hereto.
To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, or the Series D Bonds
is less than the amount to be paid at maturity of such Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at
least annually over the term of such Bonds), the difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the accrual of
which, to the extent properly allocable to each owner thereof, is treated as interest on such Bonds which is excluded
from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes. For
this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the Series D
Bonds is the first price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of such Bonds is sold to the public (excluding
bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers). The original issue discount with respect to any maturity of the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds,
and the Series D Bonds accrues daily over the term to maturity of such Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate
compounded semiannually (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The accruing original
issue discount is added to the adjusted basis of such Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon disposition
(including sale, redemption, or payment on maturity) of such Bonds. Bondholders should consult their own tax
advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, or the Series D
Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of purchasers who do not purchase such Bonds in the
original offering to the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such Bonds is sold to the public.
Series A Bonds, Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise,
for an amount greater than the stated principal amount to be paid at maturity of such Bonds, or, in some cases, at the
earlier redemption date of such Bonds (“Premium Bonds”), will be treated as having amortizable bond premium for
federal income tax purposes and Massachusetts personal income tax purposes. No deduction is allowable for the
amortizable bond premium in the case of obligations, such as the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is excluded
from gross income for federal income tax purposes. However, a Bondholder’s basis in a Premium Bond will be
reduced by the amount of amortizable bond premium properly allocable to such Bondholder. Holders of Premium
Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the proper treatment of amortizable bond premium in
their particular circumstances.
Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not
taken) or events occurring (or not occurring) after the date of issuance of the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds,
and the Series D Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, such Bonds. Further, no
assurance can be given that pending or future legislation, including amendments to the Code, if enacted into law, or
any proposed legislation, including amendments to the Code, or any future judicial, regulatory or administrative
interpretation or development with respect to existing law, will not adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of
interest on, the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds. Prospective Bondholders are urged to
consult their own tax advisors with respect to proposals to restructure the federal income tax.
Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the
Series D Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from Massachusetts
personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Series A Bonds,
the Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds may otherwise affect the federal or state tax liability of a Bondholder.
Among other possible consequences of ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the
Series A Bonds, the Series B Bonds, and the Series D Bonds, the Code requires recipients of certain social security
and certain railroad retirement benefits to take into account receipts or accruals of interest on such Bonds in
determining the portion of such benefits that are included in gross income. The nature and extent of all such other
tax consequences will depend upon the particular tax status of the Bondholder or the Bondholder’s other items of
income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences and
Bondholders should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to such consequences.
Series C Bonds
In the opinion of Bond Counsel, under existing law, interest on the Series C Bonds is included in the gross
income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes under the Code. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion
regarding any other federal tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or accrual or receipt of
interest on, the Series C Bonds.
9

Bond Counsel is also of the opinion that, under existing law, interest on the Series C Bonds is exempt from
Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the Series C Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property
taxes. Bond Counsel has not opined as to any other Massachusetts tax consequences arising with respect to the
Series C Bonds. Prospective Bondholders should be aware, however, that the Series C Bonds are included in the
income of Massachusetts estate and inheritance taxes, and the Series C Bonds and the interest thereon are included
in the measure of certain Massachusetts corporate excise and franchise taxes. Bond Counsel has not opined as to the
taxability of the Series C Bonds or the income therefrom under the laws of any state other than Massachusetts.
A complete copy of the proposed opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to the Series C Bonds is set forth in
Appendix B hereto.
The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal tax considerations generally applicable to beneficial
owners of the Series C Bonds that acquire their Bonds in the initial offering. The discussion below is based upon
laws, regulations, rulings, and decisions in effect and available on the date hereof, all of which are subject to change,
possibly with retroactive effect. Prospective investors should note that no rulings have been or are expected to be
sought from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) with respect to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences
discussed below, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will not take contrary positions. Further, the following
discussion does not deal with all U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to any given investor, nor does it
address the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to investors who may be subject to special taxing rules
(regardless of whether or not such persons constitute U.S. Holders), such as certain U.S. expatriates, banks, real
estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, dealers or
traders in securities or currencies, partnerships, S corporations, estates and trusts, investors who hold their Series C
Bonds as part of a hedge, straddle or an integrated or conversion transaction, or investors whose “functional
currency” is not the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, the following discussion does not address (i) alternative minimum tax
consequences or (ii) the indirect effects on persons who hold equity interests in a beneficial owner of Series C
Bonds. In addition, this summary generally is limited to investors who become beneficial owners of Series C Bonds
pursuant to the initial offering for the issue price that is applicable to such Bonds (i.e., the price at which a
substantial amount of such Bonds is first sold to the public) and who will hold their Bonds as “capital assets” within
the meaning of the Code.
As used herein, “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Series C Bonds who for U.S. federal income tax
purposes is an individual citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation or other entity taxable as a
corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof (including the District
of Columbia), an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or a
trust with respect to which a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more United States persons (as defined in the Code) have the authority to
control all substantial decisions of the trust (or a trust that has made a valid election under Treasury Regulations to
be treated as a domestic trust). As used herein, “Non-U.S. Holder” generally means a beneficial owner of a Series C
Bonds (other than a partnership) who is not a U.S. Holder. If an entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of Bonds, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will
depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Partners in such partnerships should
consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in the Series C Bonds (including
their status as U.S. Holders or Non-U.S. Holders).
U.S. Holders
Interest. Stated interest on the Series C Bonds generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest
income at the time such amounts are accrued or received, in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
“Original issue discount” will arise for U.S. federal income tax purposes in respect of any Series C Bonds if its
stated redemption price at maturity exceeds its issue price by more than a de minimis amount (as determined for tax
purposes). For any Series C Bonds issued with original issue discount, the excess of the stated redemption price at
maturity of that Bond over its issue price will constitute original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The stated redemption price at maturity of a Series C Bond is the sum of all scheduled amounts payable on such
Bond other than qualified stated interest. U.S. Holders of Series C Bonds generally will be required to include any
original issue discount in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues, in accordance with a constant
yield method based on a compounding of interest (which may be before the receipt of cash payments attributable to
such income). Under this method, U.S. Holders of Series C Bonds issued with original issue discount generally will
be required to include in income increasingly greater amounts of original issue discount in successive accrual
periods.
10

“Premium” generally will arise for U.S. federal income tax purposes in respect of any Series C Bonds to the
extent its issue price exceeds its stated principal amount. A U.S. Holder of a Series C Bonds issued at a premium
may make an election, applicable to all debt securities purchased at a premium by such U.S. Holder, to amortize
such premium, using a constant yield method over the term of such Bond.
Disposition of the Series C Bonds. Unless a nonrecognition provision of the Code applies, the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement (including pursuant to an offer by the City), reissuance or other disposition of a Series C
Bond will be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, a U.S. Holder of a Series C Bond
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the amount of cash plus the fair market
value of property received (except to the extent attributable to accrued but unpaid interest on the Bond which will be
taxed in the manner described above under “Interest”) and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Bond
(generally, the purchase price paid by the U.S. Holder for the Bond, increased by the amount of any original issue
discount previously included in income by such U.S. Holder with respect to such Bond and decreased by any
payments previously made on such Bond, other than payments of qualified stated interest, or decreased by any
amortized premium). Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. A material modification of the
terms of any Series C Bond may result in a deemed reissuance thereof, in which event a beneficial owner of the
modified Bonds generally will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized
from the sale, exchange or retirement (less any accrued qualified stated interest which will be taxable as such) and
the beneficial owner’s adjusted tax basis in the Bond.
In the case of a non-corporate U.S. Holder of a Series C Bond, the maximum marginal U.S. federal income tax
rate applicable to any such gain may be lower than the maximum marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to
ordinary income if such U.S. holder’s holding period for the Bond exceeds one year. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations.
Non-U.S. Holders
The following discussion applies only to non-U.S. Holders. This discussion does not address all aspects of
U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to non-U.S. Holders in light of their particular circumstances. For
example, special rules may apply to a non-U.S. Holder that is a “controlled foreign corporation” or a “passive
foreign investment company,” and, accordingly, non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to
determine the United States federal, state, local and other tax consequences of holding the Series C Bonds that may
be relevant to them.
Interest. Subject to the discussion below under the heading “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding,”
payments of principal of, and interest on, any Series C Bond to a Non-U.S. Holder, other than a bank which acquires
such Bond in consideration of an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary
course of business, generally will not be subject to any U.S. withholding tax provided that the beneficial owner of
the Bond provides a certification completed in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements,
which requirements are discussed below under the heading “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding,” or an
exemption is otherwise established.
Disposition of Series C Bonds. Subject to the discussion below under the heading “Information Reporting and
Backup Withholding,” any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement
(including pursuant to an offer by the Commonwealth) or other disposition of a Series C Bond generally will not be
subject to U.S. federal income tax, unless (i) such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by such Non-U.S.
Holder of a trade or business within the United States; or (ii) in the case of any gain realized by an individual NonU.S. Holder, such holder is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of such sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement (including pursuant to an offer by the State) or other disposition and certain other
conditions are met.
U.S. Federal Estate Tax. A Series C Bond that is held by an individual who at the time of death is not a citizen
or resident of the United States will not be subject to U.S. federal estate tax as a result of such individual’s death,
provided that at the time of such individual’s death, payments of interest with respect to such Bond would not have
been effectively connected with the conduct by such individual of a trade or business within the United States.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding—U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders
Interest on, and proceeds received from the sale of, a Series C Bond generally will be reported to U.S.
Holders, other than certain exempt recipients, such as corporations, on IRS Form 1099. In addition, a backup
withholding tax may apply to payments with respect to the Series C Bonds s if the U.S. Holder fails to furnish the
payor with a correct taxpayer identification number or other required certification or fails to report interest or
dividends required to be shown on the U.S. Holder’s federal income tax returns.
11

In general, a non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to interest payments on
the Series C Bond s if such non-U.S. Holder has certified to the payor under penalties of perjury (i) the name and
address of such non-U.S. Holder and (ii) that such non-U.S. Holder is not a United States person, or, in the case of
an individual, that such non-U.S. Holder is neither a citizen nor a resident of the United States, and the payor does
not know or have reason to know that such certifications are false. However, information reporting on IRS Form
1042-S may still apply to interest payments on the Series C Bonds s made to non-U.S. Holders not subject to backup
withholding. In addition, a non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to the proceeds
of the sale of a Series C Bond made within the United States or conducted through certain U.S. financial
intermediaries if the payor receives the certifications described above and the payor does not know or have reason to
know that such certifications are false, or if the non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Non-U.S.
Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of information reporting and backup
withholding in their particular circumstances, the availability of exemptions and the procedure for obtaining such
exemptions, if available.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and amounts withheld as backup withholding are allowed as a
refund or credit against a holder’s federal income tax liability, provided that the required information as to
withholding is furnished to the IRS.
The foregoing summary is included herein for general information only and does not discuss all aspects of
U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder of Series C Bonds in light of the holder’s
particular circumstances and income tax situation. Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors
as to any tax consequences to them from the purchase, ownership and disposition of Bonds, including the
application and effect of state, local, foreign and other tax laws.
Circular 230 Disclaimer
The preceding tax matters discussion related to the Series C Bonds is not intended or written to be used, and
cannot be used, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed under federal tax law in connection with
the Series C Bonds. Such discussion was written to support the promotion or marketing of the Series C Bonds. Each
purchaser of the Series C Bonds should seek advice based on such purchaser’s particular circumstances from an
independent tax advisor.
CREDIT RATINGS
Moody’s Investors Service Inc., (“Moody’s”), 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York,
New York, and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, a division of the McGraw-Hill companies (“Standard &
Poor’s”), 55 Water Street, New York, New York, have assigned the ratings of “Aaa” and “AA+,” respectively, to
the Bonds. Such ratings reflect only the views of such organizations and any desired explanation of the significance
of such ratings should be obtained from the rating agency furnishing the same. Generally, a rating agency bases its
rating on the information and materials furnished to it and on investigations, studies and assumptions of it own.
There is no assurance that any such ratings will continue for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be
revised downward or withdrawn entirely by the rating agency concerned, if in the judgment of such rating agency,
circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal of any such ratings may have an adverse
effect on the market price of the Bonds.

A description of certain City principal governmental services follows:
Schools
The City’s School Department provides both basic education and college preparatory curricula as
well as specialized vocational educational programs. The school system enrolled 56,340 students for the
2009-2010 school year, a decrease of approximately 47 students from the preceding school year.
Pursuant to Chapter 108 of the Acts of 1992, the City’s public schools are under the control of a
School Committee, which consists of seven members appointed by the Mayor. Members of the School
Committee have staggered four-year terms. In addition to appointing the Superintendent of Schools, the
Boston School Committee approves the School Department budget for submission to the Mayor, and by
and through the Superintendent, determines educational policy, makes all contracts for the purchase of
materials for the operations of the schools, and maintains and operates school properties. The
Superintendent of Schools has exclusive authority to make appointments and promotions for all teachers
and other School Department personnel except for the positions of Community Superintendent, Chairman,
Secretary, or Treasurer of the School Committee, School Committee Administrative Assistants, and Special
Assistant Corporation Counsels. The School Committee appoints these excepted positions.
Public Safety
The Public Safety Cabinet is continuing to improve citywide service-delivery through consolidated
and shared resources to provide more effective and efficient public safety services to Boston’s
communities.

A-6

The Police Department maintains eleven neighborhood police stations and one headquarters building.
It also maintains nine support programs, consisting of the Police Academy, Firearms Training Range,
Harbor Patrol Unit, Fleet Management Unit, Telecommunications Unit, Evidence and Property
Management Facility, Special Operations Division, Stress Support Unit and Sexual Assault Unit.
The Fire Department maintains 40 facilities consisting of 34 neighborhood fire stations, one marine
unit, a training academy, a fire prevention division, a fire alarm division, headquarters/maintenance
division/fire investigation building, and a high-pressure pumping station.
The Mayor’s Office of Emergency Preparedness coordinates and directs Boston’s interdepartmental
and multi-jurisdictional homeland security activities by advising the Mayor on issues and obtaining and
managing outside funding. See “Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness,” above.
Public Health
The Boston Public Health Commission, successor to the City’s Department of Health and Hospitals,
is a body politic and corporate separate from the City created in 1996 when the operations of the City’s
former acute-care hospital, Boston City Hospital, were consolidated with the operations of Boston
University Medical Center Hospital under the control of the Boston Medical Center Corporation
(“BMCC”), a private, Massachusetts non-profit corporation. The Commission is governed by a sevenmember board, six of whom are appointed by the Mayor, subject to confirmation by the City Council, and
one of whom, as the chief executive officer of BMCC, serves ex-officio. The Commission functions as the
City’s board of health and operates a wide range of public health programs throughout the City funded
from public and private grants and City appropriations. The Commission is a discretely presented
component unit for GAAP reporting purposes in the City’s annual audited financial statements. See “City
Indebtedness–Debt of Agencies Related to the City–Boston Public Health Commission.”
Public Works
The Public Works Department constructs and maintains highways, sidewalks, street lighting and
bridges, and oversees snow removal, street cleaning, refuse removal and recycling. The Boston Water and
Sewer Commission (“BWSC”), an independent agency, is responsible for the operation and maintenance of
the City’s water, sewer, and storm water drainage systems, the construction of improvements to those
systems, and the collection of user charges for its services. See “City Indebtedness—Debt of Agencies
Related to the City—Boston Water and Sewer Commission” below.
Other Services
The Boston Public Library Department operates a central library, 26 neighborhood branch libraries,
and two service buildings. The Parks and Recreation Department manages approximately 2,200 acres of
active, passive and historic parkland. The 2,200 acres of land include 272 parks, playgrounds, squares,
malls, plazas, and other miscellaneous sites; 16 historic and three active cemeteries; one greenhouse
facility; and approximately 33,600 street trees.
Suffolk County
While existing state law provides that the Mayor and City Council serve as the Commissioners of
Suffolk County, which includes the Cities of Boston, Chelsea and Revere and the Town of Winthrop, all of
the functions and costs of county government, (including the county courts, registry of deeds and the Office
of the Suffolk County Sheriff) have been assumed by the Commonwealth, other than an annual assessment
by the Commonwealth for the purpose of funding the unfunded portion of pension liability for retirees of
the Office of the Suffolk County Sheriff who retired prior to January 1, 2010. This annual assessment can
be no greater than the City’s fiscal 2009 appropriation to support the Office of the Suffolk County Sheriff
of approximately $4.0 million, and will terminate when the pension liability of these retirees is fully
funded.

Employee Relations
Under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 150E, most municipal employees in the Commonwealth
enjoy the right to join labor unions and bargain collectively over wages and other terms and conditions of
employment. The Office of Labor Relations represents the Mayor and the City in all collective bargaining
matters with all unions of City employees except School Department employee unions. The School
Department’s labor relations personnel similarly represent the School Committee and consult with the
Office of Labor Relations regarding contract negotiations and other general labor matters. Additionally, the
Office of Labor Relations has actively assisted the Boston Public Health Commission in collective
bargaining negotiations with its 11 bargaining units and regularly interfaces with the Boston Public Health
Commission on labor and employment matters.
Nearly all of the City’s non-school department employees are organized into bargaining units
represented by various unions. Most of these unions are affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Three large unions,
the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (“AFSCME”) Council 93 (laborer
employees), the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) Local 285 (clerical employees), and the
Salaried Employees of North America (“SENA”) Local 9158 (middle manager employees) represent the
majority of the City’s non-public safety employees.
Police officers are represented by four distinct unions, the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association
(“BPPA”), the Boston Police Superior Officers Federation (“Federation”), the Boston Police Detectives
Benevolent Society (“Detectives”) and the Boston Police Detectives Benevolent Society, Superior Officers
Unit (“Detective Superiors”). Firefighters and Fire Chiefs are divided into two bargaining units represented
by a single union: the International Association of Firefighters (“IAFF”) Local 718.
Boston teachers, teacher aides, school nurses, and substitutes are in a collective bargaining unit
represented by the Boston Teachers Union (“BTU”), an affiliate of the AFL-CIO.
The table below represents a summary of the bargaining units representing City employees, the
number of City employees represented by each bargaining unit, and the status of the City’s contract with
each bargaining unit.

Nearly all of the collective bargaining agreements between the City and the unions expired during
calendar year 2010. The terms of such agreements remain in effect until execution of successor contracts.
The current agreement with the International Association of Firefighters, Local 718, was the result of a
binding arbitration award that was modified and approved by the City Council in June, 2010. That contract
remains in effect until June 30, 2011. The City is currently in active negotiations with all of the police and
civilian unions in an effort to reach mutual agreement on successor collective bargaining contracts which
would be retroactive to the expiration dates of the prior contracts and which may include provisions for
payment of increased wages from such dates, payable in the first year of the new contract. In addition to
providing modest, affordable wage increases, the City will be seeking to make changes that will address the
rapidly increasing cost of providing health insurance to its employees.

FINANCIAL OPERATIONS
Budget Process
Program-Based Budgeting
The City of Boston maintains a program-based budgeting system to track expenditures and service
levels by major functions or “programs.” This budgeting system complies with the standards of the
Government Finance Officers Association, which has consistently recognized the City’s efforts with its
Distinguished Budget Presentation Award.
The City’s fiscal year begins July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following calendar year. Pursuant to
state law, the Mayor must submit an operating budget to the City Council by the second Wednesday in
April for its review and approval. Proposed appropriations for all departments and operations of the City
(except for the public schools and public health services) are prepared under the direction of the Mayor in
the Office of Budget Management (“OBM”). The Superintendent of Schools must submit a budget to the
School Committee by the first Wednesday in February. The School Committee must approve a budget by
the fourth Wednesday in March and forward this budget to the Mayor who may approve or reduce the total
recommended budget. The Mayor then submits the school budget to the City Council for appropriation by
the second Wednesday in May. In practice, the School Department appropriation request has been
presented to the City Council in coordination with the Mayor’s operating budget request in April. The
Boston Public Health Commission must submit a revenue and expenditure budget for public health services
to the Mayor by the second Wednesday in March. If the proposed budget provides for expenditures in
excess of the Commission’s projected revenues from non-City sources, the Mayor may either approve or
reject the budget. If the Mayor accepts the budget, the amount required to fund the revenue deficiency (the
“net cost of public health services”) is included in the annual budget for the City submitted to the City
Council in April of each year. The Commission must adopt its public health services budget by the second
Wednesday in June.
The City Council may reduce or reject any item in the Mayor’s budget but may not, except upon the
recommendation of the Mayor, increase or add an item. The City, Boston Public Health Commission and
School Department operating budgets for fiscal 2011 were approved by the City Council on June 30, 2010.
See “Financial Operations—Fiscal 2011 Budget.” After approval of the budget and until the property tax
rate is officially determined in mid-December, the Mayor may submit to the City Council such
supplementary appropriation requests as are deemed necessary, including supplemental amounts for the
School Department and the Boston Public Health Commission. The Mayor may also submit to the City
Council supplementary appropriation requests subsequent to the setting of the property tax rate provided
that an available source of revenue is identified. Under certain circumstances, the Mayor may, by
executive order, require expenditures to be limited to an amount less than the appropriated level.
In the event that the City enters a fiscal year without an approved operating budget, the City
continues departmental operations on a “one-twelfth” budget, as provided in the City Charter. Under the
one-twelfth budget process, (a) payrolls for regular employees cannot exceed the average monthly
expenditure of the last three months of the preceding fiscal year, (b) total liabilities incurred in any month
cannot exceed amounts spent for similar purposes during any one month of the preceding fiscal year, and
(c) monthly expenditures for new departments cannot exceed one-twelfth of their current fiscal year’s
estimated costs.
By law, the City must establish its property tax rate each year so that the resulting property tax levy
complies with the requirements of Proposition 2½. (For a discussion of Proposition 2½, see “City
Revenues—Property Taxes—Proposition 2½.”) The amount raised in the tax levy equals the sum of (a) the
aggregate of all amounts appropriated, granted or lawfully expended since the last annual tax levy and not
provided for, plus (b) all debt and interest charges on general obligation debt of the City maturing during
the fiscal year and not otherwise provided for, plus (c) all amounts necessary to satisfy final judgments,
plus (d) provision for certain prior years’ deficits, less (e) the aggregate of all non-property tax revenues
projected to be received in the City’s General Fund in amounts certified or approved by the Commonwealth
for tax rate purposes. In general, the City is required to raise in the tax levy a deficit incurred on a statutory
accounting basis in the prior year’s operating budget, or a deficit incurred in the property tax abatement
reserves.
Capital Budgeting
The Office of Budget and Management manages the City’s capital plan, including evaluating the
condition of the City’s capital assets, forecasting the timing and financial requirements of new
construction and rehabilitation, and assessing the allocation of current and future resources to meet the
A-10

City’s infrastructure needs. Through an annually updated five-year capital plan, the City refines its
capital needs and resources each fiscal year. In April 2010, the Mayor released the fiscal 2011-2015
capital plan and initiated loan orders for City Council consideration. There is no statutory time frame for
requesting or approving such orders. All fiscal 2011 capital authorizations were approved by the City
Council by June 30, 2010.
OBM also provides ongoing project oversight during the implementation phase of capital
projects. The City reviews and approves all capital contracts and monitors project costs and schedules
to ensure the adequacy of available funding sources in accordance with the capital plan.
Summary and Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary Basis)—Fiscal 2007-2010 and Fiscal
2011 Budget
The table below shows the City’s General Fund budget for fiscal 2011, together with budgetary actual
results for fiscal 2007 through 2010. In accordance with state law and regulations, the City’s General Fund
budget as shown below is prepared on a “budgetary basis” instead of accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Among the key differences between these two sets of
accounting principles are that “budgetary” records property tax as it is levied while GAAP records it as it
becomes susceptible to accrual, “budgetary” records certain activities and transactions in the General Fund
that GAAP records in separate funds, and “budgetary” records as an expenditure any amount raised to
cover a prior year deficit, and as a revenue any available funds raised from prior year surpluses, while
GAAP ignores these impacts from prior years. The difference in accounting principles inevitably leads to
varying results in excess or deficiency of revenues over expenditures.

and mayoral reallocations.
(2) If the City's reserves for abatements prove at the end of the fiscal year to be insufficient to cover the City's abatement liability,
the City is required to raise in the following year's tax rate an amount sufficient to generate additional reserves to cover the
shortfall. In fiscal 2011, the City has reserved 2.5% of the net levy for abatements.
(3) In fiscal 2011 the City made an extraordinary payment of $82.0 million toward its pension liability, with $59.5 million coming
from a reserve for pension obligations and $22.4 million coming from excess revenues accumulated in the deeds excise fund.
(4) Legislation that was recently passed relieved the City from any responsibility for funding teacher pensions (as is the case in all
other municipalities in Massachusetts). The budgetary effects of such a change are the elimination of the Teachers’ Pension
Reimbursement and a reduction to the Pension line-item appropriation for the liability of teachers’ pensions. See “Employee
Benefits—Retirement Systems.”
(5) Excludes noncontributory pensions and annuities that are included in departmental expenditures. The amount of such noncontributory pensions and annuities equaled $4.6 million, $4.1 million, $4.1 million, $4.1 million, and $4.1 million, respectively
in fiscal 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011.

Fiscal 2007-2010 Actual Results
During the period of fiscal 2007 to 2010, the City maintained its pattern of the past two decades and
produced budget surpluses in each year. Revenues grew steadily through the earlier years and slowed with
the recession in fiscal 2010. State aid revenue to the City increased in fiscal 2008 only to decrease in each
A-12

succeeding year thereafter. The City responded to the change in resources with a mix of tools that included
slowing the growth of departmental expenditures and the use of reserves.
In fiscal 2010, the City and the Commonwealth moved forward with a change to the mechanism for
funding Boston teachers’ pensions. This change relieved the City from any responsibility for the funding of
teachers’ pensions through the elimination of those pension costs from the City’s funding schedule, a
transfer of teachers’ pension assets from the State-Boston Retirement System to the Commonwealth’s
Pension Reserves Investment Trust (“PRIT”) fund, and ending the annual pay-as-you-go reimbursement to
the City from the Commonwealth. For more on this change and pension-related changes in the fiscal 2011
budget, see “Employees Benefits – Retirements Systems”.
Fiscal 2011 Budget
The following is a summary of the City’s fiscal 2011 budget on a budgetary accounting basis. The
figures cited are from the fiscal 2011 tax rate budget at the time of certification of both the aggregate
amount of and the rates of tax for the City’s fiscal 2011 property tax levy by the Massachusetts Department
of Revenue, plus supplemental appropriations. This certification was completed on December 17, 2010.
Expenditures
In fiscal 2011, the City’s budgeted expenditures total $2.41 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed expenses, representing an increase of $115.4 million or 5.0% from fiscal
2010 actual expenditures. Budgeted fiscal 2011 departmental expenditures compare with actual fiscal 2010
expenditures as follows: City Departments decreased $9.3 million or 0.9%; the Public Health Commission
decreased $0.2 million or 0.3%; the School Department increased $3.6 million or 0.4%; the Collective
Bargaining Reserve increased $8.6 and the appropriation to the Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB)
Trust Fund increased $15.0 million or 75.0%. Budgeted fixed expenses for fiscal 2011 compare with fiscal
2010 actual expenses as follows: Pensions increased $83.5 million or 77.0% due to factors described
below; Debt Service increased $7.6 million or 6.1%; and State Assessments increased $6.8 million or 4.8%.
Despite an expected increase in health insurance costs, budgeted fiscal year 2011 expenses for City
departments are lower than fiscal year 2010 actual expenditures. A material deficit in police overtime
occurred in fiscal year 2010 that is not reflected in the fiscal year 2011 budget. The fiscal year 2011 Police
budget has funding for new hires to cover the high attrition that the department has experienced which is
expected to lower the amount of overtime needed for staffing shortages. The Police Commissioner has also
made a concerted effort to reduce the use of nonessential overtime. Fiscal year 2010 actual expenditures
also reflect a substantial deficit in the Execution of Courts account resulting from a reserve set aside to pay
for possible adverse legal rulings. The fiscal year 2011 budget for Execution of Courts is level with the
budgeted amount in fiscal year 2010. The increase in the School Department is largely reflective of health
insurance increases.
The increase in pension costs is due to an extraordinary one-time payment made by the City in
addition to the amount originally required by the pension funding schedule. Pension expenses are mandated
by the City’s pension funding schedule as approved by the state actuary and are a legal obligation of the
City. The City would have been required to adopt a new pension funding schedule for fiscal year 2012 that
would take into account the substantial investment losses experienced in 2008 during the stock market fall.
In order to avoid the large increases in pension appropriations that would be required starting in fiscal
2012, the City elected to make a one-time payment from reserves of approximately $82 million into the
system in the current year that substantially reduced the future payments required by a new schedule. This
strategy will allow the City to more easily adjust to the financial restraints in the coming fiscal years. The
City’s current pension schedule is expected to fully fund the system by the end of fiscal 2025, fifteen years
earlier than the maximum allowed by law. See “Employee Benefits — Retirement Systems,” below. State
Assessments are also mandatory; the amounts are determined by the Commonwealth. All but a small
portion of the increase in State Assessments is the result of increases in the assessment to the City for
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (“MBTA”) service and for charter school tuition.
Revenues
Budgeted revenues for fiscal 2011 equal $2.41 billion, an increase of $106.3 million or 4.6% from
fiscal 2010 actual revenues. Selected fiscal 2011 budgeted revenues compare with fiscal 2010 actual
revenues as follows: the Gross Property Tax Levy (including new growth) increased $63.8 million or 4.3%;
Excises increased $1.9 million or 1.9%; Interest on Investments decreased $1.2 million or 37.2%; Licenses
and Permits increased $1.9 million or 6.3%; Available Funds from parking meter and cemetery fees
remained level; State Aid decreased $17.5 million or 4.2%; and Non-Recurring Revenue remained level.
A-13

The Property Tax, the City’s largest source of revenue, has become increasingly important to the
City’s recent revenue growth given the losses in the City’s second largest source of revenue: State Aid.
Property tax revenues will increase in fiscal 2011, but while growth from a new development is expected to
slow in coming years, the current levy remains comfortably below its statutory limit.
The increase in Excises is due only to the growth resulting from a full year of increased hotel excise
tax rates and the addition of a new meals tax in fiscal 2010. These new tax revenues were adopted by the
City Council in August 2009 and effective beginning October 2009. Fiscal 2010 collections represent 7
months of tax due to processing time required by the state Department of Revenue. Remaining Excise
revenue from Motor Vehicle excise and Jet Fuel excise is budgeted to decrease from fiscal 2010 along with
baseline (pre-tax rate increase) Hotel excise revenues due to continued uncertain economic conditions.
The increase in Miscellaneous Departmental Revenue reflects the extraordinary one-time payment of
$82.0 million toward the City’s pension liability described above. The revenue supporting this payment is
derived from a pension reserve and from the accumulation of many years of the City’s share of deeds
excise funds.
The decrease in Chapter 121A revenues is due to the movement of one large property from exempt to
taxable status. The taxable value of that property is now included in the property tax levy and the amount of
taxes collected exceeds the prior amount of revenue collected through the Chapter 121A agreement. The
decrease in Interest on Investment revenue is based on the continued action of the Federal Reserve to
maintain its target federal funds rate at between 0.0% and .25% and thus limiting returns on the City’s
conservative investments. The increase in Licenses & Permits is due to increased actual building permit
activity occurring in the first half of fiscal 2011.
The decrease in State Aid is due to reductions in education aid and unrestricted general government
aid and continues the trend of declining state support to all Massachusetts municipalities. For a more
detailed look at State Aid, see “City Revenues – State Aid”.
A portion of the Budgetary Fund Balance is budgeted for use in the OPEB Trust Fund (for a
discussion of OPEB, see “Employee Benefits–Other Post Employment Benefits”). Budgetary Fund Balance
is available for appropriation after certification of its value by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue.
Fiscal 2011 becomes the seventh year of use of this source of funds since fiscal 1992.
Financial Statements
The City engages independent certified public accountants to audit and report on its financial
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. An
external Audit Committee, appointed by the Mayor, monitors the progress of the annual audit, reviews the
recommendations of the firm and reports the Committee’s activities and recommendations to the Mayor
and the City Council.
The City’s audited financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, (“GAAP”). The accounts of the City are organized on
the basis of funds. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a set of self-balancing accounts that
comprise its assets, liabilities, net assets/fund balance, revenues and expenditures/expenses. For a
discussion of the significant accounting policies employed in preparing the City’s fiscal 2010 audited
financial statements, see Note 2 of such audited financial statements, which are attached hereto as Exhibit I.
The City’s fiscal 2010 financial statements received an unqualified opinion.
GAAP accounting differs from the “statutory” accounting or “budgetary” accounting basis prescribed
by the Bureau of Accounts of the Commonwealth, for the annual budget and property tax certification
process. The major differences are explained in Note 4 of the fiscal 2010 audited financial statements,
attached hereto as Exhibit I.
Attached hereto as Exhibit II are Comparative Balance Sheets and Statements of Revenues,
Expenditures, Transfers and Equity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
which have been prepared by the City’s Auditing Department based on information taken from the City’s
audited financial statements for those fiscal years.

The following is a summary analysis of the City’s financial operations on a GAAP basis over the
period fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010. The figures appearing in this section for the period are derived from
the City’s audited annual financial statements. The analyses of revenues and expenditures in the text that
follows are stated using data derived from the audited financial statements. For an explanation of the
differences between the GAAP basis and Budgetary basis of accounting, see the audited financial
statements at Exhibit I, Note 4, “Budgetary Data.”
The City’s major recurring revenue sources during this period were real and personal property taxes,
state aid, payments in lieu of taxes (“PILOTs”), local excise taxes and departmental revenues, and other
intergovernmental sources. The principal expenditures were for public safety, debt requirements, retirement
costs, and the School Department. Reference is made to Exhibits I and II attached hereto for a detailed
presentation of the City’s financial operations.
Fiscal 2008
During fiscal year 2008, the City’s revenues increased by 4.6% from fiscal year 2007. The City’s
largest sources of revenues were property taxes, state aid, excise taxes, and payment in lieu of taxes totaling
$1.49 billion (67.3% of total revenue). Property taxes increased $57.9 million, an increase of 4.6% from the
previous year. Departmental and other increased by $13.4 million, representing a 20.4% change from fiscal
2007. The main factors were: an increase in fringe retirement reimbursement from grants of $1.1 million,
an increase in pension and annuities of $5.4 million. Licenses and permits totaled $46.0 million, a 13.0%
increase from fiscal 2007. The primary factor was a $3.9 million increase in building permit revenues.
The increase in revenues allowed for an increase in expense categories. The City's expenses covered
a range of services. The largest expenses were for schools ($782.5 million), public safety ($509.3 million),
other employee benefits ($190.2 million), state and district assessments ($132.8 million), debt service
($115.8 million), public works ($108.8 million), and retirement costs ($95.2 million). Schools realized a
$38.7 million (5.2%) increase while public safety realized an expenditure increase of $31.9 million (6.7%).
The driving force behind the increased expenses for schools and public safety were increases in salaries and
employer charges. The rise of the cost of health care was the main proponent for other employee benefits
increasing by $14.3 million. Public works represented a $10.9 million increase primarily due to snow
removal costs. State and district assessments realized a nearly 7.0% increase due to increases in
Commonwealth assessments for charter school tuition and MBTA assessments. Debt service expenses
increased due to increases in scheduled principal and interest payments. Retirement costs expenses
increased due to an increase in the City’s actuarially required contribution.
The General Fund’s equity balance as of June 30, 2008 was $802.0 million, as compared to $732.0
million in fiscal 2007. The increase of $70.0 million or 9.6% is primarily due to a continued increase in
receipts from property and excise taxes. Please refer to the statements of General Fund activity in the
Comparative Balance Sheets and Statements of Revenues and Expenditures (Exhibit II to this Appendix A),

A-15

and Note 2 in Notes to Basic Financial Statements (Exhibit I to this Appendix A) for a more in-depth
explanation of these entries and the manner in which they impact the fund equity balance calculation.
Fiscal 2009
During fiscal year 2009, the City’s revenues increased by 0.8% from fiscal year 2008. The City’s
largest sources of revenue were property taxes, excise taxes and fines totaling $1.58 billion, or 70.7% of
total revenue. Property taxes increased $76.6 million, representing a positive change of 5.8% from fiscal
year 2008. Departmental and other revenue increased by $3.1 million, or 3.9% from the prior fiscal year.
This growth was primarily caused by an increase in Medicaid part D and an increase in affirmative
recovery receipts from the law department. Revenues from investment income and licenses and permits
totaled $59.1 million, a combined decrease of $24.7 million from fiscal year 2008. The primary factor for
the decrease in investment income was lower returns on the City’s investments. The decrease in licenses
and permits was due to a decline in the amount of building permits issued, a side effect of the slow real
estate market.
In fiscal year 2009, expenditures increased by a total of $61.2 million, or 2.8% from fiscal year
2008. The City’s largest expenses were for schools ($818.3 million), public safety ($521.9 million), other
employee benefits ($191.6 million), state and district assessments ($142.1 million), debt service ($119.3
million), public works ($112.2 million), and retirement costs ($82.3 million). Schools experienced an
expenditure increase of $35.8 million (4.6%) while public safety realized an increase of $12.6 million
(2.5%). The cause of the increase in both schools and public safety was due to a continued growth in
payroll and payroll related costs. State and district assessments realized a $9.3 million (7.0%) increase due
to Commonwealth assessments for charter school tuition and MBTA assessments. The $3.3 million (3.1%)
increase in public works expenditures was primarily due to snow removal costs.
The General Fund’s equity balance as of June 30, 2009 was $828.7 million, as compared to $802.0
million in fiscal 2008. The increase of $26.7 million, or 3.3%, was primarily due to continued increases in
Real and Personal Property Tax revenues.
Fiscal 2010
In fiscal year 2010, the City’s General Fund revenue increased by 0.5% from fiscal year 2009. The
City’s largest sources of revenues were property taxes, excise taxes and fines of $1.66 billion or 74% of
total revenue. Property taxes increased $74.2 million, representing a positive change of 5.3% from fiscal
year 2009. Departmental and other revenue, investment income and licenses and permits had a combined
revenue decrease of $30.1 million or 21.4% from fiscal 2009. Lower returns on City investments and a
decline in building permits continue to be the major factors for this decrease in revenue.
Fiscal year 2010 General Fund expenditures increased by $171.6 million, or 7.6% from fiscal year
2009. The City’s largest expenditures were for schools ($815.7 million), public safety ($511.4 million),
retirement costs ($235.3 million), other employee benefits ($224.2 million), and state and district
assessments ($146.3 million). Schools experienced a decrease in expenditures of $2.6 million (0.3%), while
Public Safety saw an expenditure decrease of $10.5 million (2.0%). Other employee benefits and state and
district assessments experienced increases of $32.6 million (17.0%) and $4.3 million (3.0%), respectively.
Retirement costs increased $153.0 million in 2010. This extraordinary increase is attributable to the
aforementioned change in the funding of Boston Teachers’ Pensions. As a direct result of the change in the
funding mechanism between the City and the Commonwealth, the City did not receive $118.8 million in
state reimbursement for the Teachers’ Pension contribution it made in fiscal year 2009. This change caused
a notable, one-time impact to the City’s retirement costs, as well as General Fund equity. Consequently, the
City’s General Fund equity balance as of June 30, 2010 was $707.2 million, a decrease of $121.5 million
from fiscal year 2009.

City of Boston Treasury Department.

Financial Administration
Pursuant to state law mandates and policy initiatives, the City has established a system of internal
management controls. These controls are designed to maximize revenue collections, monitor operating and
capital spending, evaluate infrastructure needs, and enhance the City’s internal control in business
procedures. Major components of the City’s system of financial management controls include:
Revenue Collections
The City has implemented a comprehensive accounts receivable management program that
coordinates the collection of departmental revenues. The City has afforded taxpayers the ability to remit
payment for licenses, permits, fees, and fines with credit and debit cards and has given taxpayers an
alternative choice in paying real estate taxes by use of online direct debit. The City secures its statutory lien
for delinquent real estate taxes with instruments recorded at the Suffolk County Registry of Deeds (“tax
takings”). For more information concerning tax takings and collection of delinquent real estate taxes, see
“City Revenues—Property Taxes—Delinquent Taxes and Tax Title.”
Debt Management
The City uses a comprehensive, interactive debt capacity model that assists debt management
administrators in evaluating the potential impact of debt issues on cash flow, credit and statutory debt
capacity.
The Treasury Department manages all City borrowings. The Treasury Department focuses on the
timing of borrowings to take advantage of favorable market conditions and manages the City’s cash flows
to help obviate the need for short-term borrowings for operating purposes. The Treasury Department has
established a series of debt management guidelines and has instituted a debt policy that direct the City’s
approach toward its debt management activities, including rapid debt repayment, the use of a debt capacity
model for establishing debt affordability, limitations on the level of variable rate debt the City will employ,
maintenance of the relationship between debt and repayment sources, target savings for refundings, and
reporting and liaison with the financial community and the rating agencies.
Financial Management
Financial management is supported through the use of the Boston Administrative Information
Systems (BAIS). BAIS is an integrated financial and human resources management system that is designed
to track and control daily activities and report the financial position of the City. BAIS performs the
specialized functions of encumbrance control, budget control, position management, payroll allotment
reporting, fund accounting, and capital project and grant management. Real time edits prohibit excessive
commitments and overspending, while on-line access to information, including monthly revenue and
expenditure reports, allows department managers to evaluate directly the financial status of individual
programs and the entire department. The utilization of these systems supports the rigorous monitoring and
reporting requirements enforced by the City.
The City of Boston has consistently received unqualified opinions on the audit of its Basic Financial
Statements and has been presented with a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting
from the Government Finance Officers Association for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
A-17

Investment Policy
The City has enacted and annually reviews and updates its investment policy statement that dictates
the types of investments made by the City Treasury. The policy also focuses on the appropriate balance of
liquidity and the rate of return on investments. Bond proceeds, in conformance with the City’s policy, are
invested in highly liquid, fully collateralized investments.
Performance Management and Program Evaluation
Boston About Results (BAR) is the City’s performance management and evaluation program. At its
core, BAR aims to create a sustainable and reliable performance management system which captures the
core functions of City departments and citywide strategic goals, assists in the decision-making process,
identifies areas of improvement, and effectively communicates performance results to a broad range of
stakeholders.
Using performance management as its foundation, BAR encourages organization changes and
operational improvements that increase the effectiveness and productivity of City departments. The
program does this by providing reliable, objective, and independent information and reports to City
managers about department performance and operations.
Risk Management
The City of Boston’s Risk Management Program focuses on a planned strategy of self-insurance
supported by strong prevention and cost reduction efforts, financial reserves and catastrophic insurance.
The citywide program first focuses on limiting unnecessary asset losses due, for example, to third
party legal liability claims, property losses, workplace injuries, employee healthcare and unemployment
compensation. The City’s Corporation Counsel defends the City in any lawsuits that arise from the normal
course of operations. Assets and losses are tracked and quantified and areas are targeted for improvement
efforts.
The City budgets for and funds the costs described above through the general fund, except for selfinsured healthcare costs, which are managed by Blue Cross Blue Shield, and financed through an
employee/employer trust fund established in compliance with Section 3A of Chapter 32B of the General
Laws.
To protect the City’s assets from adverse loss, commercial insurance is purchased strategically for
certain exposures. A catastrophic property insurance policy provides $100 million all risk protection after a
$13.0 million deductible; boiler and machinery losses are insured up to $10 million. For unexpected large
losses, the City maintains a catastrophic risk reserve, the available balance of which equaled $12.6 million
at the end of fiscal 2010.
Energy Management
The Mayor’s Energy Management Board is charged with making decisions regarding the City’s
procurement, use, and conservation of energy as well as the minimization of the impact of fossil fuel
consumption on public health. The Energy Management Board is comprised of the City's Director of
Administration and Finance, Chief of Environmental and Energy Services, Chief of Public Property, and
Chief of Public Health.
The Energy Management Board commissioned an Integrated Energy Management Plan that is
intended to assure progress toward the fulfillment of its mission. The first project identified in the
Integrated Energy Management Plan, lighting controls in City Hall, was completed in 2009, and a second
phase of the efficiency project for City Hall is underway. Planning for the second project identified in the
plan, a comprehensive energy management project at the main branch of the Boston Public Library, is also
currently underway.
Since March 2005, the City has independently contracted with third party electricity suppliers to meet
all of the City's electricity supply requirements. To date, the supply costs the City has paid to its third party
electricity supplier have been less than the default supply costs offered by the City's local electricity
distribution company, NSTAR - Boston Edison Company.

CITY REVENUES
The principal sources of City revenue available to meet operating expenditures are property taxes,
state aid, excise revenues, departmental revenues, and federal and state grants, all of which are described
below. Except as specifically noted, all amounts are stated on a budgetary accounting basis. References to
fiscal 2011 are unaudited.
Property Taxes
Real and personal property taxes are the largest single source of the City’s revenue. The City’s gross
property tax levy for fiscal 2011 equals $1.54 billion, or 63.9% of City General Fund revenues for such
period. Certain properties are subject to arrangements that suspend the imposition of real property taxes at
normal rates in order to encourage development. See “City Revenues—Property Taxes—Revenues from
Chapter 121A Properties” below.
As discussed below, Proposition 2½ limits the level of property taxation in the City. In fiscal 2011,
the City will again levy taxes below the 2.5% ceiling on the overall effective tax rate. The City is not
expected to reach the levy ceiling in the foreseeable future due to previous growth in the real estate market.
Proposition 2½
Proposition 2½ is a statewide tax limitation subject to amendment or repeal by the legislature that
imposes two separate limits on the annual tax levy of a city or town. The primary limitation of Proposition
2½ is that the property tax levy in any city or town in the Commonwealth cannot exceed 2.5% of the full
and fair cash valuation of the taxable real estate and personal property in that city or town (the “2½
ceiling”). The only exception is the temporary exclusion of debt service or capital costs from the levy
ceiling restrictions, as described below.
Within the limits of the 2½ ceiling, the Growth Levy Limit is a secondary limitation imposed by
Proposition 2½. The Growth Levy Limit prohibits the levy in a fiscal year from exceeding an amount equal
to 102.5% of the maximum allowable limit for the preceding year, subject to exceptions for the following:
property newly added to the tax rolls and valuation increases other than as a result of a general revaluation
(“new growth”); temporary exclusions from the tax levy limitation to pay for capital costs or debt service
on indebtedness; and “overrides,” which are permanent increases in the tax levy for general expenditures of
the city or town. Exclusions and overrides must be approved by a referendum of the voters of the city or
town. The levy is permanently increased by the addition of new growth and overrides, except that any
override to fund a stabilization fund will not be taken into account in calculating the maximum levy limit in
subsequent fiscal years unless the City Council votes to appropriate such increased amount in such
subsequent year to the stabilization fund. The exclusion of debt service by referendum temporarily
increases the levy amount and the duration of the specific debt excluded. The Growth Levy Limit may be
exceeded by an override in any year by a majority vote of the voters. An increase in the Growth Levy Limit
under this procedure, however, does not permit a tax levy in excess of the 2½ ceiling, since the two
limitations apply independently. The applicable tax limits may also be reduced in any year by a majority
vote of the voters. The City’s gross levy in fiscal 2011 equals $1.54 billion. In fiscal 2011, the allowable
2.5% increase is $36.6 million, and “new growth” is $37.6 million.
In order to mitigate its adverse impact on local government revenues, Proposition 2½ limits the
annual rate of increase of aggregate, statewide assessments made upon cities and towns by the
Commonwealth and certain of its governmental entities, such as assessments made upon the City and
certain other cities and towns for the MBTA, to 2.5% of the prior year’s assessment. Proposition 2½ also
limits the motor vehicle excise tax rate to 2.5%.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Proposition 2 ½ described above, the City’s Bond Procedure Act
of 1983 mandates assessment of taxes in excess of the Proposition 2½ levy limits to the extent that the debt
service on City obligations is not otherwise provided for in the tax levy or from other sources, with no
allowance made for any other expenditures of the City. See “City Indebtedness—Classification of City
Debt.”

Revaluation
State law mandates a revaluation of all taxable property every three years. These revaluations are
reviewed and certified by the Commonwealth. In the years between revaluations, the Commonwealth
permits municipalities to establish new values on the basis of market changes, using the most recent
revaluation as a basis. The City has adjusted certified property values in accordance with this procedure in
years when market conditions indicated such adjustment was necessary.
In November 2009, the City concluded work on its tenth triennial revaluation for fiscal 2010, with an
assessment date of January 1, 2009. For fiscal 2011, assessments were based on market activity leading up
to the assessment date of January 1, 2010. Fiscal 2011 assessments for many homeowners were level with
the prior year, with some neighborhoods continuing to see declines in property value due to weakening real
estate market conditions. As of the assessment date, the commercial market continued to experience
moderate decline in total value. See “City Revenues—Property Taxation—Taxes by Use; Tax Rates.”

The City utilizes five classes of property for taxation purposes: (i) residential, (ii) open space land,
(iii) commercial, (iv) industrial and (v) personal property. Within limits under state law, the City may
determine the share of the annual levy to be borne by each of the categories. Under these statutory limits,
the residential tax rate cannot be given a discount greater than 50%, while the tax rate on the remaining
business classes of property cannot exceed 175% of the overall effective tax rate.
The City may also exempt a portion of the assessed valuation of residential real property when used
as the taxpayer's principal residence. The amount of the residential exemption can equal up to 30% of the
average assessed value of all residential property in the City. In fiscal 2011, qualifying residents who
receive the residential exemption have their taxable assessed values reduced by $124,695. The residential
exemption has no impact on the overall tax rate.
Tax Base
The following table shows, for purposes of year-to-year comparison, the assessed valuations with
respect to all property in the City subject to taxation, used for determining the tax levies and tax rates in
fiscal years 2007 through 2011.

The methodology used in creating the table involves the search of the title holder, or holders, of all major parcels of property in
the City. This methodology does not necessarily locate all parcels owned by affiliates nor does it differentiate between
percentage ownership in a particular parcel.
Pursuant to Chapter 59 of the General Laws, Section 4, personal property consists of movable physical items not permanently
attached to real estate. Many items of personal property are exempt from taxation in Massachusetts. Examples of taxable
personal property include equipment owned by businesses, poles, wires and machinery of utility companies, and aircraft.
Normandy Real Estate Partners acquired the Hancock Tower at auction in March 2009 (previously owned by Broadway
Partners). Normandy Real Estate Partners, in turn, sold the Hancock Tower to Boston Properties in December 2010. The
Hancock Tower is reflected in Normandy’s real estate figure since they were owner of record as of the FY 2011 assessment date
of January 1, 2010.

The City’s property tax bills are mailed quarterly in July, October, December, and April. The bills
mailed in July and October represent preliminary tax bills each equal to one quarter of the previous fiscal
year’s liability. The fair cash value of the property or assessment for the purpose of determining the new
fiscal year tax liability is reflected in the third and fourth quarter bills, which are mailed in December and
April. See “City Revenues—Property Taxes—Taxation by Use; Tax Rates.”
Delinquent Taxes and Tax Titles
Real and personal property taxes (not including motor vehicle, the room occupancy and the aircraft
fuel excises) are based on values established by the Assessing Department as of each January 1, and are due
in quarterly payments every August, November, February and May. Delinquent real estate and personal
property taxes are subject to a 14% per annum interest charge. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year in
which real estate taxes become delinquent, the City secures its lien for such taxes by taking legal title to all
delinquent properties, subject to the owners’ right of redemption. After this process, known as a “tax
taking,” is complete, interest accrues on outstanding amounts of delinquent real estate taxes at the rate of
16% per annum. If the taxes remain unpaid for a period of six months from the tax taking, the City may
petition the Land Court to foreclose the equity owner’s right of redemption. Upon foreclosure, the City may
then sell the property in order to liquidate the tax liability. The City estimates that the value of the
properties to which such tax titles are attached is substantially less than the amount of delinquent taxes,
charges, and interest owed.
Tax title receipts were $16.9 million, $16.2 million, and $14.9 million, respectively, in fiscal 2008,
2009 and 2010.
Revenues from Chapter 121A Corporations
A local government in cooperation with its redevelopment authorities may suspend the imposition of
real property taxes at normal levels on properties determined to be “blighted” in order to encourage
redevelopment of such properties by special corporations organized under Chapter 121A (“Chapter 121A
Corporations”). The City receives three forms of revenue from Chapter 121A Corporations. The first
consists of excise PILOTs for each Chapter 121A Corporation that are collected by the Commonwealth and
distributed to the City. The second form of revenue is contract payments resulting from agreements that
may be entered into between the Chapter 121A Corporation and the City relating to City services available
to the development. A third form of revenue does not generate significant payments.
Revenue received by the City from Chapter 121A Corporations for the last three fiscal years are
shown in the following table.

State Aid
State aid from the Commonwealth comprises the second largest revenue source to the City’s General
Fund. Over the course of the previous decade, support to municipalities from the Commonwealth has been
reduced dramatically.
The Governor’s fiscal 2012 budget proposes a reduction in one of the major categories of local aid to
municipalities and an increase in another category compared with fiscal 2011 levels. The Legislature,
however, has not yet released its budget proposals and has not acted on the Governor’s plan. Therefore, no
assurance can be given that state aid to municipalities will not be further reduced as the state budget
process continues.
The effects of the current recession on the City’s state aid include reductions in actual state aid
totaling $38.9 million, or 7.9% in fiscal 2009 and an additional $41.2 million, or 9.1%, in fiscal year 2010.
A further reduction of $17.5 million, or 4.2%, is budgeted for fiscal 2011. In total, over the last three fiscal
years the City has lost $97.6 million or nearly 20% of its support from the Commonwealth.
Under the Massachusetts Constitution and state finance law, the State Treasurer has the authority to
delay the allotment of state aid appropriations under certain circumstances. In addition, the statute
governing the distribution of school aid provides that such payments are due only to the extent that
sufficient funds are available. The State Treasurer is also empowered to deduct from state aid amounts
appropriated to the City the amount of “charges” or “assessments.” The largest of these assessments are
those for MBTA service and tuition for students attending charter schools.
Assessments also include smaller charges for various state-provided services, which may include debt
service paid by the Commonwealth on “qualified bonds” and any sums allocable to the Boston Water and
Sewer Commission or the City that are due and unpaid on debt issued to the Massachusetts Water Pollution
Abatement Trust (“MWPAT”). The City has no “qualified bonds” outstanding and has never been assessed
for unpaid amounts due the MWPAT. Total state assessments are expected to amount to $148.7 million in
fiscal 2011. State assessments totaled $137.7 million and $141.9 million in fiscal years 2009 and 2010,
respectively.
Total state aid net of assessments, or “net state aid,” is expected to decrease $24.3 million, or 9.0%, to
$247.0 million to the City in fiscal 2011. Net state aid totaled $271.3 million in fiscal 2010 and $316.7
million in fiscal 2008. Since fiscal 2007, the City has lost $118 million or 32.3% of its net state aid.
State School Building Assistance
Under its school building assistance program, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts provides grants
to cities, towns and regional school districts for school construction projects. Until July 26, 2004, the State
Board of Education was responsible for approving grants for school projects and otherwise administering
the program. Grant amounts ranged from 50% to 90% of approved project costs. Municipalities generally
issued bonds to finance the entire project cost, and the Commonwealth disbursed the grants in equal annual
installments over the term of the related bonds. Approved project costs included the interest expense
incurred on debt issued by a municipality to finance the school project.
Due to demand for school building assistance grants far exceeding available funds, the state
legislature created the Massachusetts School Building Authority (the “MSBA”) in 2004 to finance and
administer the school building assistance program. The MSBA has assumed all powers and obligations of
the State Board of Education with respect to the program. In addition to certain other amounts, the
legislation dedicates a portion of Commonwealth sales tax receipts to the MSBA to finance the program.
Projects previously approved for grants by the State Board of Education are entitled to receive grant
payments from the MSBA based on the approved project cost and reimbursement rate applicable under the
prior law. As of June 30, 2010, the City had approximately $44.9 million of bonds outstanding for school
projects approved for grants under the prior law at a reimbursement rate of 90% of approved project costs.
The MSBA has paid and is expected to continue to pay the remaining amounts of the grants for such
projects in annual installments to reimburse debt service on bonds issued by the City to finance such
projects.
Projects on the State Board of Education’s project priority waiting list as of July 1, 2004 are also
entitled to receive grant payments from the MSBA based on the eligible project costs and reimbursement
rates applicable under the prior law. In 2005, the MSBA approved grants at a reimbursement rate of 90% of
approved project costs for three City projects on the priority waiting list as of July 1, 2004. In January
2009, the City and the MSBA executed a project funding agreement for Burke High School, the last City
school project on the priority waiting list as of July 1, 2004, that will provide up to $42.4 million in State
support for the project. As of March, 2011, the City has received approximately $40.3 million.
A-24

The MSBA in 2008 promulgated regulations with respect to the application and approval process for
new projects. The range of reimbursement rates for such projects has been reduced to between 40% and
80% of approved project costs. In addition, the MSBA expects to pay grants for such projects as project
costs are incurred pursuant to a project funding agreement between the MSBA and the municipality. In
most cases, the receipt of these progress payments from the MSBA will eliminate the need for the
municipality to borrow on a temporary basis to finance the MSBA’s share of project costs. However, none
of the interest expense incurred on debt issued by municipalities to finance their portion of the costs of new
projects will be included in the approved project costs eligible for reimbursement.
Currently, two City school projects have been approved by the MSBA to move into the
feasibility study phase to determine the most appropriate, cost effective solution for the projects.
During the feasibility stage of each project, the City will be reimbursed by the MSBA for 75% of
feasibility study costs. The ongoing analysis and consideration of the City’s project proposal by the
MSBA does not represent or imply a commitment by the MSBA to fund the project. The MSBA’s
financial commitment to a project is only determined through the project funding agreement after
careful analysis and the development of architectural and engineering documents.
Excise Revenues
In addition to the major sources of revenue described above, the City receives various other types of
revenues. See “Financial Operations—Summary and Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary
Basis)—Fiscal 2007-2010 and Fiscal 2011 Budget” above. In fiscal 2010 the City gained one new
significant excise revenue source (meals excise) and expanded an existing source (room occupancy excise).
The following is a description of those and other significant excise revenue sources of the City.
Room Occupancy Excise
In accordance with state law, the City historically imposed a 4.0% local room occupancy excise upon
the transfer of occupancy of any room in a hotel, lodging house or motel. The Commonwealth granted
authority to municipalities in 2009 to increase the local option room occupancy excise to 6.0%. The City
adopted the increased local option room occupancy excise of 6.0%, effective October 1, 2009. The
Massachusetts Department of Revenue is responsible for collecting and remitting local option room
occupancy excise receipts to the City on a quarterly basis in arrears. The City’s room occupancy excise
receipts totaled $40.3 million, $36.6 million, and $43.9 million, respectively, in fiscal 2008, 2009 and 2010.
See “Summary and Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary Basis) - Fiscal 2007-2010 and Fiscal
2011 Budget—Fiscal 2011 Budget—Revenues.”
Pursuant to Chapter 152 of the Acts of 1997, as amended (the “Convention Center Act”), the City
established the City of Boston Room Occupancy Excise Fund (the “Excise Fund”), to provide for the
payment of the principal of and interest on indebtedness issued by the City to fund the City’s share of costs
of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center Project (the “BCEC Project”). See “City Indebtedness—
Special Obligation Debt.” The Convention Center Act authorizes the City to retain in the Excise Fund any
portion of the excise receipts not applied to such principal and interest or to transfer all or a portion of such
amount to the City’s General Fund. The City transferred $23.0 million, $27.0 million and $30.0 million,
respectively, in fiscal 2008, 2009 and 2010, from the Excise Fund to the General Fund.
Aircraft Fuel Excise
The City also assesses an aircraft fuel excise upon the sale of jet fuel. The Commonwealth collects
this tax and distributes it to the City quarterly. The City’s aircraft fuel excise receipts totaled $18.8 million,
$34.5 million, and $22.9 million respectively, in fiscal 2008, 2009 and 2010. It should be noted that the
City received only three quarterly excise payments in fiscal 2008, and received a payment attributable to
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, the City received three quarterly payments
attributable to fiscal 2009 plus one quarterly payment attributable to fiscal 2008. This collection pattern has
been repeated in fiscal 2010. See “Summary and Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary Basis) Fiscal 2007-2010 and Fiscal 2011 Budget.”
Motor Vehicle Excise
The Commonwealth assesses an excise on the registration of motor vehicles, the proceeds of which
are received by the municipality where the vehicle is principally garaged. The excise is a uniform rate of
$25 per $1,000 of vehicle valuation. The City’s annual motor vehicle excise receipts totaled $49.6 million,
$44.6 million, and $40.1 million respectively, in fiscal 2008, 2009 and 2010. See “Summary and
Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary Basis) - Fiscal 2007-2010 and Fiscal 2011 Budget.”

A-25

Meals Excise
The Commonwealth granted authority to municipalities in 2009 to levy a .75% meals excise on
locally sold prepared food and beverages at local option. The Massachusetts Department of Revenue is
responsible for collecting and remitting meals excise receipts to the City on a quarterly basis. The City’s
annual meals excise receipts totaled $10.0 million for the 7 months of FY10 when the tax was in effect. See
“Summary and Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary Basis) - Fiscal 2007-2010 and Fiscal 2011
Budget—Fiscal 2011 Budget—Revenues.”
Vehicular Rental Surcharge
The Commonwealth imposes a $10 surcharge on each vehicular rental transaction contract in the
City. One dollar of each surcharge is paid to the City for deposit in the City’s Excise Fund to provide for
the payment of the principal of and interest on indebtedness issued by the City to fund the City’s share of
costs of the BCEC Project. The City’s annual share of vehicular rental surcharges totaled $1.2 million, $1.1
million, and $1.1 million respectively, in fiscal 2008, 2009 and 2010. See “City Indebtedness—Special
Obligation Debt.”
Departmental Revenues
Several City departments generate significant revenues from fees and charges.
Parking Fines
The City’s annual parking fine receipts totaled $63.3 million, $65.9 million, and $66.3 million
respectively, in fiscal 2008, 2009 and 2010.
Building Permit Fees
The Inspectional Services Department performs a variety of functions for which fees are imposed
such as the granting of building permits. The City’s annual building permit fees totaled $31.7 million,
$27.0 million and $14.8 million respectively, in fiscal 2008, 2009 and 2010.
Municipal Medicaid Reimbursement
The Office of Budget Management oversees a vendor contract to collect federal reimbursements for
Medicaid eligible services provided through the Boston Public Schools. The City’s annual municipal
Medicaid reimbursement revenue totaled $15.8 million, $14.7 million and $18.7 million respectively, in
fiscal 2008, 2009 and 2010.
Other Available Revenues
Under state law, proceeds of the sale of City facilities must be applied to the Surplus Property
Disposition Fund to be used to finance capital projects, unless the City Council, with the approval of the
Mayor, votes to credit to the General Fund the difference between the sale proceeds and the amount of debt
(both principal and interest) incurred in acquiring or improving the sold facility. As of June 30, 2010, there
was $24.1 million remaining in the Surplus Property Disposition Fund.
Grants
The City receives both federal and state grant funds, some of which are determined according to
formulas, and others that are awarded competitively. These moneys are recorded in special revenue funds.
Federal Grants
Some major sources of federal grant funds in fiscal 2010 included: a Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) Entitlement Program award of $19.8 million; a Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME)
award of $8.5 million; a Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) award of $1.8
million, and a 2009 McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Program award of $19.2 million. The City also
received $99.7 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act grant awards from the federal
government and federal pass-through awards from the Commonwealth.
Major sources of federal grant funds for programs of the Boston Public Schools included: a Title I
Elementary & Secondary Education Act of 1965 award of $45.6 million; Special Education Entitlement
Grant awards of $21.8 million; and School Lunch Program awards of $28.0 million. The Boston Public
Schools were also awarded $18.0 million from a variety of other federal grant sources during the 2010
fiscal year.

A-26

State Grants
In addition to State Aid, the City also received state grants. In fiscal year 2010, the Police Department
received Community Services grant awards that totaled $1.1 million from the Commonwealth’s Office of
Public Safety. Boston Public Schools were awarded approximately $16.8 million. Furthermore, two major
programs were supported by state education grants, the Special Education Student 50/50 Program totaling
$7.0 million and the Quality Full-Day Kindergarten Grant totaling $2.4 million.
CITY INDEBTEDNESS
Classification of City Debt
Direct general obligation debt of the City is debt for which the City’s full faith and credit are pledged
and for the payment of which all taxable property in the City is subject to ad valorem taxation without limit
as to rate or amount. General obligation bonds of the City may also be secured in certain circumstances by
a pledge of specific City revenues. The special obligation debt of the City is debt, which may be secured
solely by a pledge of specific revenues derived from a revenue-producing facility of the City or for the
payment of which the City’s obligation is subject to annual appropriation.
General Obligation Debt
On June 30, 2010, the City had outstanding approximately $960.4 million of general obligation longterm bonds, all of which bear fixed rates of interest. On March 1, 2011, the City had approximately $891.9
million of bonds outstanding.
The City is authorized to secure any of its general obligation indebtedness by a pledge of all or any
part of any revenues of the City including, without limitation, any tax, such as real property taxes, any fees
payable to or for the account of the City, and certain receipts, distributions and reimbursements held or to
be received by the City from the Commonwealth. The City currently has no general obligation bonds or
notes outstanding secured by such a pledge.
Debt Limits
All debt of the City requires the authorization of the City Council and approval of the Mayor. If the
Mayor vetoes a loan order passed by the City Council, the charter of the City provides that the loan order is
void and may not be passed over the Mayor’s veto. Authorization of bonds under a loan order of the City
Council includes, unless otherwise provided, the authorization to issue temporary notes in anticipation of
such bonds.
The statutory debt limit for the City consists of a debt limit and a double debt limit. The debt limit is
5%, and the double debt limit is 10%, of the valuation of taxable property in the City as last equalized by
the State Department of Revenue. Biannually, prior to January 31st, the Commissioner of Revenue
establishes a final equalized valuation which is the basis for determining the debt limit for the following
two-year period or until another equalization has been established. The equalized valuation of taxable
property in the City established by the Commissioner of Revenue in January 2010 equals $106.0 billion.
Based on the current equalized valuation, the City’s debt limit equals approximately $5.30 billion, and its
double debt limit equals $10.60 billion.
The City may authorize debt up to its debt limit without state approval. The City may authorize debt
over the debt limit up to the double debt limit with the approval of the Municipal Finance Oversight Board,
composed of the State Treasurer and Receiver General, the State Auditor, the Attorney General and the
Director of Accounts. As of June 30, 2010, the City had outstanding debt of $792.6 million subject to the
debt limit, and authorized but unissued debt subject to the debt limit of $467.7 million. As of March 1,
2011, the City had outstanding debt of $741.1 million subject to the debt limit, and authorized but unissued
debt subject to the debt limit of $596.9 million. Based on the City’s current debt limit of $5.30 billion, the
City had the capacity to authorize an additional $3.96 billion of debt as of March 1, 2011.

There are many categories of general obligation debt which are not subject to the debt limit and are
therefore not included in the Debt Incurring Capacity table above. Some such debt is, however, subject to
other debt limits, dollar limitations or state approval. As of March 1, 2011, the City had a total of $891.9
million in long term debt outstanding, of which $150.8 million was exempt from the debt limit. As of that
date the City also had $81.8 million of long-term debt that was authorized but unissued and exempt from
the debt limit.

Short-Term Borrowings
Although the City is authorized to borrow for operating purposes through the issuance of short-term
notes in anticipation of revenue receipts, it has not done so in several years. In addition, the City is
authorized to issue short-term debt obligations (“BANs”) in anticipation of the issuance of long-term
bonds. Currently, no BANs are outstanding.
Special Obligation Debt
In addition to general obligation indebtedness, the Bond Procedure Act of 1983 and various other
special acts authorize the City to incur indebtedness which is secured by and payable solely from certain
revenues of the City which are pledged for the payment of such indebtedness or which are subject to annual
appropriation by the City for such purpose. The only special obligation indebtedness of the City
outstanding as of March 1, 2011 was $73.1 million Special Obligation Refunding Bonds, Boston City
Hospital Issue (the “BCH Bonds”) and $93.5 Convention Center Loan, Act of 1997, Special Obligation
Bonds, Series A (the “Convention Center Bonds”).
The BCH Bonds were issued in 2002 in connection with the restructuring of debt originally incurred
by the City in 1990 (and refunded in 1993) to finance a major construction and renovation program for the
City’s former acute-care hospital then known as Boston City Hospital (“BCH”). On July 1, 1996, the
operations of BCH and Boston University Medical Center Hospital were consolidated into Boston Medical
Center, which is owned and operated by the Boston Medical Center Corporation (“BMCC”), a private
Massachusetts non-profit corporation. Simultaneously with the consolidation, all other public health
operations of the City’s Department of Health and Hospitals, as well as title to BCH, were transferred to the
Boston Public Health Commission (the “Commission”), and the BCH campus was leased to BMCC for an
initial term of 50 years.
The BCH Bonds are special obligations of the City payable from, and secured solely by a pledge and
assignment of amounts payable on a promissory note issued to the City by the Commission. The
promissory note is in turn a special obligation of the Commission secured by an assignment and pledge of
rents payable by BMCC to the Commission under the lease of the BCH campus and, upon any failure of
BMCC to pay all or any part of such rent, the proceeds of certain assistance grants payable by the City to
BMCC. The payment of assistance grants to BMCC is subject to annual appropriation by the City and the
payment of rent by BMCC is contingent upon the appropriation and payment of such assistance grants. The
A-30

rent payments and the assistance grants are each at least equal, in amount and terms of payment, to the
principal and interest payable on the BCH Bonds. The City has also covenanted and agreed, subject to
appropriation, to meet any deficiency in the amounts otherwise pledged for the payment of the BCH Bonds.
The BCH Bonds do not constitute general obligations of the City and the full faith and credit of the City are
not pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on the BCH Bonds.
The Convention Center Bonds were issued by the City in April, 2002 pursuant to Chapter 152 of the
Acts of 1997 as amended ( the “Convention Center Act”) to permanently finance certain costs incurred by
the City in connection with the development of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center (the “BCEC
Project”), a joint development of the City, acting through the Boston Redevelopment Authority (the
“BRA”), which was responsible for the acquisition, preparation and remediation of the site for the BCEC
Project, and the Commonwealth, acting through the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority (the
“MCCA”), which was responsible for the construction of the project and which owns and operates the
facility. As provided in the Convention Center Act, the City reimbursed the BRA for $181.3 million of site
costs for the BCEC Project, funded in part from the proceeds of the Convention Center Bonds and in part
from special revenues available to the City, including the proceeds from the sale of hackney (taxi)
medallions authorized by the Convention Center Act.
The Convention Center Bonds do not constitute general obligations of the City and the full faith and
credit of the City are not pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Convention Center
Bonds. The Convention Center Bonds are special obligations of the City payable solely from, and secured
solely by a pledge of, certain excise receipts and other revenues deposited in the City of Boston Room
Occupancy Excise Fund (the “Excise Fund”) established by the City in accordance with the Convention
Center Act, including all amounts received by the City from the 6.0% local option room occupancy excise
imposed in Boston and from a portion of a surcharge imposed by the Commonwealth on vehicular rental
transaction contracts in Boston.
The Convention Center Act authorizes the City to annually transfer to the City’s General Fund all or
any portion of the amounts deposited in the Excise Fund that are not required for the payment of the
Convention Center Bonds or for the payment of any special obligation bonds or general obligation bonds of
the City issued to refund the Convention Center Bonds. Amounts deposited in the Excise Fund have
historically been more than sufficient to pay the debt service on the Convention Center Bonds, and the City
anticipates that such amounts will in the future continue to exceed the debt service on such bonds and any
bonds issued to refund such bonds. In fiscal 2008, 2009, and 2010, moneys in the Excise Fund in excess of
the debt service requirements on the Convention Center Bonds were transferred to the General Fund in the
amounts of $23.0 million, $27.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively. See “City Revenues-Excise
Revenues” above.
Debt of Agencies Related to the City
In addition to general obligation and special obligation indebtedness of the City, the City and certain
agencies related to the City are authorized to issue debt which is solely an obligation of the agency or
which, although issued by the City, are payable solely from revenues derived from projects financed by
such debt. Except as described below, such obligations do not constitute a debt of the City.
Boston Water and Sewer Commission
The Boston Water and Sewer Commission (the “Commission”) is an independent body politic and
corporate and a political subdivision of the Commonwealth created in July 1977. The Commission, among
its other powers, is authorized to operate and maintain the water and sewer systems of the City, construct
improvements to the systems, collect user charges for its services, and finance its activities and its
borrowing through its revenues. The City is not obligated on debt issued by the Commission. The
Commission’s user charges, as required by statute, are designed to produce revenues to the Commission
sufficient to pay all of its current operating expenses. These user charges are anticipated to increase
moderately. The City’s property tax base is not used to subsidize water and sewer services.
Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston
The Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston (“EDIC”) is a body politic and
corporate and an instrumentality of the Commonwealth with a board of five members, also appointed as the
members of the Boston Redevelopment Authority (“BRA”). EDIC has a variety of powers to assist
industrial development projects in the City including the power to issue special obligation revenue bonds to
finance economic development projects in the City, which are solely the obligation of EDIC, or the owner
or lessee of the financed project. The City is also authorized to appropriate or borrow monies in aid of
EDIC development projects within certain urban renewal debt limitations.
A-31

Boston Redevelopment Authority
The BRA is a public body politic and corporate constituting the City’s redevelopment authority. It
acts as the City’s planning board and exercises certain powers of the state Department of Housing and
Community Development. The BRA board consists of four members appointed by the Mayor, subject to
confirmation by the City Council, and one appointed by the state Department of Housing and Community
Development. The staff includes architects, economists, engineers, lawyers and urban planners, as well as
management personnel and administrative support. The BRA provides the planning support for major
construction, development and redevelopment activity in the City. Although the BRA is authorized to issue
revenue bonds and notes which would not constitute indebtedness of the City, BRA projects have
traditionally been financed through a combination of federal and state grants, the proceeds of general
obligation bonds issued by the City and revenues from the lease or sale of land.
Boston Public Health Commission
The Boston Public Health Commission is a body politic and corporate and a political subdivision of
the Commonwealth created in June 1996 as the successor to the City’s Department of Health and Hospitals.
See “The City—Principal Government Services—Public Health.” The Commission is responsible for the
implementation of public health programs in the City and serves as the board of health of the City. In
addition to its other powers, the Commission is authorized by its enabling act, with the approval of the City
Council and the Mayor, to borrow money for any of its corporate purposes from the City or from the
Massachusetts Health and Educational Facilities Authority. Debt of the Commission is not a debt or other
obligation of the City. Other than the promissory note described below, no debt of the Commission is
currently outstanding.
Pursuant to agreements between the City, the Commission, BMCC and a trustee for the benefit of the
registered owners of the BCH Bonds, the Commission has agreed to apply rents received from BMCC to
the payment of a promissory note issued by the Commission to the City and assigned by the City as
security for the BCH Bonds. Payments made by the Commission on the note are applied by the City to pay
the principal of and interest on the BCH Refunding Bonds. See “City Indebtedness-Special Obligation
Debt.”
The Commission is also obligated to reimburse the City for debt service paid on all outstanding
general obligation bonds of the City issued for public health and hospital purposes. Such bonds were
outstanding on March 1, 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of $3.7 million. The Commission has
required, and can be expected to continue to require, substantial financial support from the City to maintain
its public health mission and programs, including satisfaction of its obligations described above.
Other Agencies and Corporations
Two other public bodies are empowered, either by themselves or through the City, to issue special
obligation revenue bonds. The BHA is responsible for the construction, financing and operation of
residential housing for low-income persons. While the City provides certain municipal services to BHA
developments, and capital expenditures for City infrastructure related to those developments, the City is not
directly or indirectly liable for operating or debt service expenses of the BHA. The City, acting by and
through the Boston Industrial Development Financing Authority, is authorized to issue revenue bonds to
finance the construction of industrial, commercial and pollution-control facilities. The City has also
traditionally provided financial assistance to a number of nonprofit corporations organized to provide and
conduct civic and charitable functions for residents and visitors to the City and to stimulate the economic
development of the City.
Major Contractual Obligations
In addition to its debt obligations, the City has substantial contractual obligations. Included in this
category are the City’s obligation for pension benefit payments to its contributory retirement system for
City employees and other post employment benefits which is included in the annual tax levy (see
“Employee Benefits”); agreements for the provision of sanitation, solid waste collection and disposal
services (see “The City—Principal Government Services—Public Works”); and agreements with BMCC
for the provision of operating assistance and capital grants (see “City Indebtedness—Special Obligation
Debt” and “Debt of Agencies Related to the City—Boston Public Health Commission” above) The City has
also executed several equipment lease agreements in order to finance the acquisition of departmental
equipment. As of March 1, 2011, the amount outstanding under the lease agreements equaled $29.1
million. Lease payments are subject to annual appropriation and are not included in the City’s debt limit.

Capital Planning and Borrowing Program
Capital Planning Process
The capital planning process coincides with the annual budget cycle and provides an opportunity for
City departments to identify their facility, equipment, infrastructure, technology and planning needs in a
systematic manner and to forward their proposals to the Office of Budget Management (OBM) for funding
consideration. The first phase concludes with the release of an updated five-year capital plan published as
part of the City’s annual budget document. The process allows for a continuing reassessment of capital
needs. On April 13, 2010, the Mayor submitted his fiscal 2011 budget to the City Council which included
$53.3 million in new authorizations to support the fiscal 2011-2015 capital plan. All authorizations were
approved by the City Council by June 30, 2010.
Capital Funding Plan
The City funds its capital plan primarily through general obligation bonds and external grants. The
City awards construction contracts and incurs capital outlay costs based upon appropriations to be funded
from bond proceeds and grant receipts. In circumstances where project expenditures occur prior to the
receipt of bond proceeds or grant reimbursements, the City temporarily pays such costs from available
funds.
Current Capital Investment Plans
The City’s fiscal 2011-2015 capital plan proposes long-term investments over the next five years. In
all, $1.5 billion from City and non-City sources are proposed to be spent on capital projects. These
expenditures will be used for improvements to schools, libraries, parks, community centers, roads, bridges,
street lights and other City-owned facilities and infrastructure.
The fiscal 2011-2015 capital plan includes projects to improve the physical condition of the City’s
schools, including ongoing roof replacements, masonry repairs and fire alarm system upgrades. Significant
investment in the City’s technology infrastructure and business applications is underway including data
center consolidations, server virtualization, implementation of a new computer-aided-dispatch system for
public safety departments and an implementation of an enterprise asset management system. In December,
2010 a branch library reopened after a substantial renovation that makes the branch eligible for LEED
certification in the category of commercial interiors. In the fall of 2011, a new LEED-Silver police station
in Dudley Square will open. It is being built on a former brownfield site.
The maintenance of the City’s roadways and sidewalks is a significant part of the capital plan. In
fiscal 2010, 29.2 miles of roads were reconstructed or resurfaced. Nearly 20 miles of bike lanes were
added. In December, the City completed a pilot program of replacing nearly 2,700 mercury vapor street
lights with energy efficient LED lights. The City expects to replace a total of 6,000 street lights including
the pilot program by the end of fiscal 2011. In addition, $43 million in road and traffic signal improvements
funded by the American Recovery and Reimbursement Act are ongoing including 27 miles of roadway
resurfacing and upgrading traffic signal communications and major reconstruction of Dorchester Avenue.
In view of the economic and social benefits of consistent, long-range capital planning, the City
remains committed to implementing its capital program.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Retirement Systems
The City’s employees are not participants in the federal social security system. The City participates
in a contributory defined benefit retirement system that is administered by the State-Boston Retirement
System (“SBRS”). The SBRS provides pension benefits to retired City employees under a state
contributory retirement statute, and is administered by a Retirement Board comprised of five members: the
City Auditor, who serves ex-officio; two individuals elected by members of the system; an individual
chosen by the Mayor; and an individual chosen by the other four members or appointed by the Mayor if the
other four members do not agree on a selection within 30 days of a vacancy. All retirement allowances are
primarily paid by employer and employee contributions and the resulting investment earnings. Employee
contributions in the form of a mandatory deduction from regular compensation constitute an annuity fund
from which the annuity portion of the retirement allowance is paid.
On December 4, 2008, the City, the SBRS, the Commonwealth and the Public Employee Retirement
Administration Commission, (“PERAC”), the state commission established to oversee all 106
Massachusetts public retirement systems, entered into a Memorandum of Agreement for transfer of the
direct responsibility for funding Boston teachers’ pension liabilities to the Commonwealth effective in
A-33

fiscal year 2010. Legislation mirroring this agreement was signed into law on May 22, 2010. The
legislation eliminated the City’s role in the funding of teachers’ pension allowances, eliminated the state
reimbursement to the City for teachers’ pensions on a “pay-as- you-go” basis, and transferred pension fund
assets held by the SBRS allocable to teachers’ pension liabilities to the Commonwealth’s Pension Reserve
Investment Trust (“PRIT”) fund. While the Commonwealth is now directly responsible for funding Boston
teachers’ pension liabilities, the SBRS continues to administer pension services for Boston teacher
employees and retirees.
Chapter 61 of the Acts of 2009, as amended, transferred approximately 1,000 employees of the
Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department to the Commonwealth effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the
same employees changed their membership from the SBRS to the state retirement system, their annuity
accounts were transferred to the state system, and the Commonwealth is now responsible for the pension
liability for all such employees retiring on or after January 1, 2010. Former employees of the Suffolk
County Sheriff’s Department who retired prior to January 1, 2010 remain with the SBRS and the City will
be annually assessed for any unfunded portion of their pension liability.
In addition to the SBRS, the Boston Retirement System, the predecessor system to the SBRS, is
funded by the City. This predecessor system has as its members only those active and retired employees
whose employment commenced prior to 1946 and who have not elected coverage under the SBRS
program. This system is funded on a “pay-as-you-go” basis. In addition to the SBRS and its predecessor
system, the City also provides noncontributory retirement benefits to certain former employees whose
employment predates the SBRS and its predecessor system, certain veterans who meet certain state law
requirements, those former employees retired under Massachusetts Special Acts, or families receiving
killed-in-the-line-of-duty benefits. The City is currently providing such benefits to approximately 143
pensioners.
Amounts expended or estimated to be expended by the City for pension and annuity contributions to
SBRS and its predecessor system in the most recent fiscal periods (net of state reimbursements for teacher
retirement costs) are as set forth below.

The actuarial accrued liability of the SBRS exceeds the actuarial value of the SBRS’s assets. As part
of the change in the funding of Boston teachers’ pension liability described above, the last two SBRS
actuarial valuations included separate valuations for Boston teachers and for “All Other” SBRS members.
The “All Other” category includes all non-teacher City employees and retirees plus all non-teacher
employees of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the Boston Housing Authority, the Boston Water and
Sewer Commission, and the Boston Public Health Commission. While the City’s annual operating budget
includes amounts to be expended for pension and annuity contributions to SBRS and its predecessor system
on account of employees of the Boston Public Health Commission, the City is not responsible for such
contributions on account of employees of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the Boston Housing
Authority and the Boston Water and Sewer Commission.
The following table summarizes the results of the actuarial valuations as of January 1, 2008 and 2010
for SBRS – All Other. The actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2010 is incorporated herein by reference and
is available at: http://www.cityofboston.gov/retirement.

City of Boston Retirement Board.

Recent SBRS valuations assume a long-term rate of return of 8.0% for SBRS – All Other assets. The
actuarial valuation of assets is determined by annually recognizing 20% of gains or losses, and in addition,
to the extent necessary, by also recognizing any additional portion of gains or losses which keeps the
actuarial valuation of assets between 80% to 120% of market value of assets. The net effect is to smooth
the trend of annual pension funding during volatile short-term periods of asset gains and losses. The market
value of assets of the SBRS – All Other as of January 1, 2010 was $2.960 billion. The actuarial value of
assets as of January 1, 2010 was 107.5% of the market value.
The following market rates of return are based on information provided from SBRS to PERAC, and
reported in the PERAC annual 2009 report. The long-term average annualized return for the whole SBRS
(measuring since January 1, 1985) is equal to 9.1%. The SBRS recorded a five-year average annualized
return (January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2009) equal to 4.6% due largely to the rate of return for the
SBRS of minus 24.2% in 2008. In calendar year 2009 investment rate of return result was 19.7%, the
SBRS’s best rate of return since 2003. The resulting increase during 2009 in asset value partially mitigated
the decrease in asset value experienced in 2008.
In accordance with Chapter 68 of the Act of 2007, PERAC annually reviews investment performance
and funded ratio of systems as of January 1st. If a system is: (i) less than 65% funded, and (ii) has trailed
the investment performance of the PRIT fund by 2% or more on an average annualized basis over the
previous ten year period, PERAC will declare the system underperforming and the system shall transfer its
assets to the PRIT fund. Such transfer and control would be permanent. As of December 31, 2009, the
SBRS has trailed the PRIT fund by approximately three-tenths of 1% on an average annualized rate of
return basis over the previous ten year period.
The City is currently committed to a funding schedule for fiscal 2012, 2013, and 2014 that is based
upon the actuarial valuation incorporating asset and liability data as of January 1, 2010. The funding
schedule is calculated in accordance with the entry age actuarial cost method and includes paying the
current year’s estimated present value of benefits earned during the year (“normal cost”) and an annual
contribution (currently assumed to increase by 4.5% per year) toward reducing the unfunded liability of the
SBRS to zero by 2025, fifteen years prior to the legally required funding date of 2040. The funding
schedule also takes into account cost of living adjustments (“COLAs”) set by the SBRS each year since
1999 and assumes a COLA will be approved in future years. The schedule will be further updated by the
SBRS, in consultation with the City, with each new valuation at least every three years, subject to approval
by PERAC.
Other Post Employment Benefits
In addition to the pension benefits described above, the City provides post-employment health care
and life insurance benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis in accordance with state statute to approximately
13,900 City and Boston Public Health Commission participating retirees and their beneficiaries. The City
currently pays 75% of Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Massachusetts premiums and 85% of HMO premiums for
most retirees and their beneficiaries. The City also pays 50% of the premiums for $5,000 of life insurance
for each eligible retiree. Expenditures for such purposes are projected to be approximately $146.3 million
in fiscal 2011.
GASB Statement No. 43, Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefit Plans Other Than Pension
Plans, and GASB Statement No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for
Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions, became effective June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2008,
respectively. These statements require the City to account for and report the value of its future other postemployment benefit (OPEB) obligations currently rather than on a pay-as-you-go basis.
An independent actuarial valuation of the City’s OPEB obligations at June 30, 2009, estimated that
the total OPEB actuarial accrued liability of the City and the Boston Public Health Commission as of that
date on account of then current retirees, beneficiaries and dependents and current active members was
A-35

between $5.80 billion (partially funded) and $3.69 billion (fully funded), depending on the funding policy
elected by the City. Subsequent to that date, the City adopted MGL Chapter 32B, Section 18A, requiring
future Medicare-eligible retirees to enroll in a Medicare supplemental plan on a prospective basis. In
addition, the City completed transitioning all employees, including retirees, to an increased HMO premium
share. A supplemental report to the actuarial valuation estimated that the total OPEB actuarial accrued
liability of the City and the Commission after consideration of these actions was between $4.7 billion
(partially funded) and $3.11 billion (fully funded). The City’s annual actuarially required contribution to
OPEB for fiscal year 2011 is projected to be approximately $275.1 million under a partially funded policy
and approximately $217.9 million under an actuarially fully funded policy.
Due to the absence of legal authority to establish a trust fund for the purpose of prefunding OPEB
liabilities in the same manner as traditional pension benefits when the GASB statements became effective,
the City established an OPEB Stabilization Fund in the fiscal 2008 Budget for this purpose. An
appropriation of $20 million to the OPEB Stabilization Fund was included in the fiscal 2008 budget and
$25 million was included in the fiscal 2009 budget.
In June 2009, the City accepted Chapter 479 of the Acts of 2008 (“Chapter 479”) authorizing the City
to establish a separate trust fund and to appropriate amounts to the fund in accordance with a schedule
developed by an actuary retained by the City and approved by the state actuary in order to reduce the City’s
unfunded actuarial OPEB liability and to meet the normal cost of future OPEB benefits. In accordance with
Chapter 479, in February 2010 the City established an irrevocable Other Post Employment Benefits Trust
Fund under a Trust Agreement between the City and the City’s Collector-Treasurer as trustee and
custodian. Appropriations of $20 million and $35 million to the City’s OPEB Trust Fund were included in
the fiscal 2010 budget and fiscal 2011 budget, respectively. A separate OPEB trust fund has also been
established by the Boston Public Health Commission and the Commission invested $1.25 million in the
fund in fiscal 2011. The City also procured investment consulting services in order to optimize investment
of the OPEB Stabilization Fund and the OPEB Trust Funds. The aggregate amount on deposit in the OPEB
Stabilization Fund and the OPEB Trust Funds as of January 31, 2011 was approximately $107.7 million.
Additional information regarding the City’s OPEB obligations may be found in two
financial reports—“Actuarial Valuation & Review of OPEB June 30, 2009,” and “Actuarial
Valuation & Review of OPEB (Supplemental Report) June 30, 2009”—which are available at
http://www.cityofboston.gov/AdministrationFinance.

Independent Auditors’ Report

The Honorable Mayor and City Council
City of Boston, Massachusetts:
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the
business-type activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the
aggregate remaining fund information of the City of Boston (the City), Massachusetts, as of and for
the year ended June 30, 2010, which collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements as
listed in the table of contents. These financial statements are the responsibility of the City’s
management. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our
audit. We did not audit the financial statements of certain entities, which represent 3.1% and 2.7% of
the assets and revenues of the aggregate remaining fund information, respectively, and 23.7% and
23.5% of the assets and revenues of the discretely presented component units, respectively. Those
financial statements were audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our
opinion on the financial statements, insofar as it relates to the aggregate remaining fund information
and the discretely presented component units and their effects on the governmental and fiduciary
activities, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing
Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. The financial statements of the
permanent funds and private-purpose trust funds were not audited in accordance with Government
Auditing Standards. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit and the reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.
In our opinion, based on our audit and the reports of other auditors, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental
activities, the business-type activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major
fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the City of Boston, Massachusetts, as of
June 30, 2010, and the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows
thereof and the respective budgetary comparison for the general fund for the year then ended in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

the U.S. member firm of KPMG International Cooperative
(“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity.

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated November
19, 2010 on our consideration of the City’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests
of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and
other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over
financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the
internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit
performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be considered in assessing
the results of our audit.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 3 through 15 and the schedules of funding progress
and employers’ contributions on page 70 are not required parts of the basic financial statements, but
are supplementary information required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have
applied certain limited procedures which consisted principally of inquiries of management regarding
the methods of measurement and presentation of the required supplementary information. However,
we did not audit the information and express no opinion on it.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

(Unaudited)
The City of Boston (the City) provides this Management’s Discussion and Analysis to present additional
information to the readers of the City’s basic financial statements. This narrative overview and analysis of
the financial activities of the City is for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Readers are encouraged to
consider this information in conjunction with the additional information that is furnished in the City’s
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR).

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the City’s financial statements. The
City’s basic financial statements include three components: 1) Government-wide Financial Statements,
2) Fund Financial Statements, and 3) Notes to the Financial Statements. This report also contains required
supplementary information regarding historical pension information and other postemployment benefit
(OPEB) plan information. The components of the financial statements are described in the following
sections.

Basic Financial Statements
The basic financial statements include two types of financial statements that present different views of the
City – the Government-wide Financial Statements and the Fund Financial Statements. These financial
statements also include the Notes to the Financial Statements that explain some of the information in the
financial statements and provide more detail.

Government-wide Financial Statements
The Government-wide Financial Statements provide a broad view of the City’s operations in a manner
similar to a private-sector business. The statements provide both short-term and long-term information
about the City’s financial position, which assists in assessing the City’s economic condition at the end of
the fiscal year. These are prepared using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis
of accounting. This basically means they follow methods that are similar to those used by most
businesses. They take into account all revenues and expenses connected with the fiscal year even if cash
involved has not been received or paid. The Government-wide Financial Statements include two
statements:
•

The Statement of Net Assets presents all of the government’s assets and liabilities, with the difference
between the two reported as net assets. Over time, increases or decreases in the City’s net assets may
serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the City is improving or deteriorating.

•

The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the government’s net assets changed
during the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net assets are reported as soon as the underlying
event giving rise to the change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues
and expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will not result in cash flows until
future fiscal periods (such as uncollected taxes and earned but unused vacation leave). This statement
also presents a comparison between direct expenses and program revenues for each function of the
City.

Both the above financial statements have separate sections for the three different types of city programs or
activities. These three types of activities are:
•

Governmental Activities – The activities in this section are mostly supported by taxes and
intergovernmental revenues (federal and state grants). Most services normally associated with city
government fall into this category, including general government, human services, public safety,
public works, property and development, parks and recreation, library, schools, county, public health
programs, state and district assessments, and debt service.

•

Business-type Activities – These functions normally are intended to recover all or a significant
portion of their costs through user fees and charges to external users of goods and services. These
business-type activities of the City include the activities related to the City’s Convention Center
Bond Fund and Hospital Bond Fund.

•

Discretely Presented Component Units – These are operations for which the City has financial
accountability but function independent of the City. For the most part, these entities operate similar
to private-sector businesses and the business-type activities described above. The City’s four
discretely presented major component units are the Boston Public Health Commission, the Boston
Redevelopment Authority, the Economic Development Industrial Corporation, and the Trustees of
the Boston Public Library

Complete financial statements of the individual component units can be obtained from their respective
administrative offices. Additional information about the City’s component units is presented in the Notes
to the Financial Statements.
The Government-wide Financial Statements can be found immediately following this discussion and
analysis.

Fund Financial Statements
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been
segregated for specific activities or objectives. The City, like other local governments, uses fund
accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements.
The Fund Financial Statements focus on individual parts of the City government, reporting the City’s
operations in more detail than the Government-wide Financial Statements. All of the funds of the City can
be divided into three categories. It is important to note that these fund categories use different accounting
approaches and should be interpreted differently. The three categories of funds are:
Governmental Funds – Most of the basic services provided by the City are financed through
governmental funds. Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported
as governmental activities in the Government-wide Financial Statements. However, unlike the
Government-wide Financial Statements, the Governmental Fund Financial Statements focus on near-term
inflows and outflows of spendable resources. They also focus on the balances of spendable resources
available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in evaluating the government’s

City of Boston, Massachusetts

(Unaudited)
near-term financing requirements. This approach is known as using the flow of current financial resources
measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this approach, revenues are
recorded when cash is received or when susceptible to accrual. Expenditures are recorded when liabilities
are incurred and due. These statements provide a detailed short-term view of the City’s finances to assist
in determining whether there will be adequate financial resources available to meet the current needs of
the City.
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the Government-wide Financial
Statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar
information presented for governmental activities in the Government-wide Financial Statements. By
doing so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing
decisions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues,
expenditures, and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between
governmental funds and the governmental activities. These reconciliations are presented on the page
immediately following each governmental fund financial statement.
The City presents four columns in the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund
statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances. The City’s three major governmental
funds are – the General Fund, the Special Revenue Fund, and the Capital Projects Fund. All nonmajor
governmental funds are combined in the “Other Governmental Funds” column on these statements. The
Governmental Fund Financial Statements can be found immediately following the Government-wide
Financial Statements.
Of the City’s governmental funds, the General Fund is the only fund for which a budget is legally
adopted. The Statement of Revenues and Expenditures – Budgetary Basis is presented on page 24. This
statement provides a comparison of the original and final budget and the actual expenditures for the
current and prior year.
In accordance with state law and regulations, the City’s legally adopted General Fund budget is prepared
on a “budgetary” basis instead of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Among the key
differences between these two sets of accounting principles are that “budgetary” records property tax as it
is levied, while GAAP records it as it becomes susceptible to accrual, “budgetary” records certain
activities and transactions in the General Fund that GAAP records in separate funds, and “budgetary”
records any amount raised that covers a prior year deficit as an expenditure and any available funds raised
from prior year surpluses as a revenue, while GAAP ignores these impacts from prior years. The
difference in accounting principles inevitably leads to varying results in excess or deficiency of revenues
over expenditures. Additional information and a reconciliation of “budgetary” to GAAP statements is
provided in note 4 to the financial statements.
Proprietary Funds – These funds are used to show activities that operate more like those of commercial
enterprises. Because these funds charge fees for services provided to outside customers including local
governments, they are known as enterprise funds. Proprietary Funds provide the same type of information
as the Government-wide Financial Statements, only in more detail. Like the Government-wide Financial
Statements, Proprietary Fund Financial Statements use the accrual basis of accounting. No reconciliation
is needed between the Government-wide Financial Statements for business-type activities and the

Proprietary Fund Financial Statements. The basic Proprietary Funds Financial Statements can be found
immediately following the Governmental Fund Financial Statements.
Fiduciary Funds– These funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the
City government. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the Government-wide Financial Statements because
the resources of these funds are not available to support the City’s own programs. The accounting used
for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds. They use the accrual basis of accounting.
The City’s fiduciary funds are the Employee Retirement Fund (the State-Boston Retirement System),
which accounts for the transactions, assets, liabilities, and net assets of the City employees’ pension plan,
the OPEB Trust Fund, which is an irrevocable trust established for the accumulation of assets to reduce
the unfunded actuarial liability associated with the City’s obligation to other postemployment benefits,
and the Private Purpose Trust Funds, which includes money held and administered by the City on behalf
of third parties.
The Fiduciary Funds Financial Statements can be found immediately following the Proprietary Fund
Financial Statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements
The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in
the Government-wide and the Fund Financial Statements. The Notes to the Financial Statements can be
found immediately following the Fiduciary Funds Financial Statements.

Required Supplementary Information
The basic financial statements are followed by a section of required supplementary information, which
includes a schedule of funding progress and a schedule of employer contributions for the State-Boston
Retirement System as well as the schedule of funding progress for the City’s OPEB plan.

CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL IMPACTS
•

Due to amendments in Massachusetts General Law, the funding mechanism for Boston Teachers’
Pensions changed in fiscal year 2010. Consequently, the legislation eliminates the City’s role in the
funding of teachers’ pension allowances and transfers pension fund assets held by the SBRS
allocable to teachers’ pension liabilities to the Pension Reserves Investment Trust (PRIT) Fund. As a
result of the change in legislation, in fiscal year 2010 the City did not receive reimbursement of
$118.8 million in teachers’ pension expense that was accrued for at the end of fiscal year 2009. This
change caused a dramatic, one-time impact on the City’s financial statements that is evident at the
both the government-wide and fund levels, as will be highlighted in subsequent sections.

•

In fiscal year 2010, the City of Boston’s OPEB obligation continues to play an integral role in the
government-wide financial results. With each passing year, the City is required to recognize an
additional portion of its unfunded actuarial accrued liability, which will only continue to add to the
deficit in unrestricted net assets.

GOVERNMENT-WIDE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
This analysis is based on the Statement of Net Assets found on page 17 and the Statement of Activities
found on pages 18 and 19 of the financial statements.

Government-wide Highlights
Net Assets – Primary Government – The total assets of the City exceeded its liabilities at fiscal year ended
June 30, 2010 by $555.1 million (presented as net assets). At year end, the city had a deficit in
unrestricted net assets in the amount of $106.3 million. This represents the City’s election to fund certain
long term liabilities as they come due, rather than as they are incurred.
Changes in Net Assets – Primary Government – The City’s total net assets decreased by $224.9 million in
fiscal year 2010. Net assets of governmental activities decreased by $230.5 million, while net assets of the
business-type activities increased by $5.6 million.

Net Assets
As noted earlier, net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government’s financial position.
The City’s combined net assets (governmental and business-type activities) totaled $555.1 million at the
end of 2010, compared to $780.1 million at the end of the previous year.
The components of net assets comprise the following: the investment in capital assets such as land,
buildings, equipment, and infrastructure (road, bridges, and other immovable assets), less any related debt
used to acquire that asset that is still outstanding – this amount is $427.1 million indicating that the net
book value of the City’s capital assets exceeds the amount of capital debt outstanding. The City uses these
capital assets to provide services to citizens; consequentially, these assets are not available for future
spending. Although the City’s investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be
noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital
assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.
A portion of the City’s governmental activities net assets, $234.3 million or 40%, represents restricted net
assets, or resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used. Internally imposed
designations of resources are not presented as restricted net assets. The remaining balance of net assets
represents the deficit in unrestricted net assets. Unrestricted net assets decreased $284.9 million from
2009. This decrease is largely due to the previously mentioned teachers’ pension funding change and the
increase in the OPEB actuarial liability which is discussed.
At the end of the current fiscal year, the City is reporting a positive net asset balance for the government
as a whole. The negative net asset balance reported for business-type activities is offset by the positive
balance reported for governmental activities. The negative balance in business-type activities is a result of
special obligation bonds outstanding at year-end. These costs are intended to be covered by user charges,
grants, and lease receipts from third parties.

Governmental Activities
The City’s governmental activities net assets decreased by $230.5 million over the prior fiscal year. The
following net changes occurred during the course of operations in fiscal year 2010: In the assets accounts,
cash and investments increased by $5.6 million, receivables decreased by $187.9 million, and capital
assets increased by $62.9 million. In the liability accounts, there were increases in warrants and accounts
payable of $29.6 million, unearned revenue of $11.6 million, and accrued liabilities of $35.6 million.
Additionally, an increase of $105.6 million was recorded relative to the City’s other postemployment
obligation in 2010.
During fiscal year 2010, the City’s revenues decreased by 2.3%. The City’s largest sources of revenues
were property taxes, excise taxes, and payment in lieu of taxes of $1.66 billion (63.4% of total revenue)
and $717.4 million of program revenues (27.4% of total revenue). The primary factors for the increase in
tax revenue were an increase in property tax, meals excise, and hotel room occupancy excise. The
decrease in program revenue is attributable to decreases in MSBA reimbursements as well as building
permit revenues. Investment income and other miscellaneous revenues for fiscal year 2010 totaled
$39.1 million, up $4.4 million from fiscal year 2009. The primary cause of the increase is the result of a
transfer of sale of surplus property revenue in fiscal year 2010, whereas fiscal year 2009 had no such
transfer.
The City’s expenses cover a range of services. The largest expenses were for schools ($1.31 billion),
public safety ($930.8 million), public works ($131.9 million), property and development ($118.5 million),
general government ($106.4 million), public health programs ($71.5 million), and human services
($52.3 million). Despite a slight increase in expenses of $23.6 million from 2009, the City was aggressive
in containing costs in 2010 as a result of decreases in state funding. All categories of government continue
to experience an increase in expenses due to the recognition of the City’s OPEB expense, which increased
$105.6 million in 2010.
In 2010, governmental activities expenses exceeded program revenues (i.e., user charges, operating
grants, and capital grants) by $2.1 billion. This shortfall was covered primarily through taxes
($1.66 billion) and unrestricted grants and contributions ($171.2 million).
Comparative data on these revenues and expenses is itemized in the reporting of the Changes in Net
Assets (Deficit) – Primary Government on page 9.

Business-type Activities
Net assets from business-type activities increased $5.6 million during fiscal year 2010. This change in net
assets resulted primarily from hotel/motel excise tax collections exceeding program expenses.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE CITY’S FUND STATEMENTS
This analysis is based on the Governmental and Proprietary Fund Financial Statements on pages 20
through 27. As noted earlier, the City uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with
finance-related legal requirements.

Fund Highlights
Governmental Funds – Fund Balances – As of the close of fiscal year 2010, the City’s governmental
funds reported a combined ending fund balance of $963.2 million, a decrease of $112.6 million from the
prior year. Of this total amount, $606.0 million represents the “unreserved and undesignated fund
balances” with $547.3 million of this amount in the General Fund. The decrease in fund balance is largely
due to the previously mentioned change in teachers’ pension funding.

Governmental Funds
The focus of the City’s governmental funds is to provide information on near-term inflows, outflows, and
balances of spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the City’s financial requirements.
In particular, unreserved fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government’s financial position
at the end of the fiscal year.
General Fund – Fund Balance – The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the City. The City’s
General Fund – Fund Balance Policy states in part to maintain a GAAP undesignated fund balance in the
General Fund that is 10%, or higher, of GAAP General Fund operating expenditures for the fiscal year.
The GAAP undesignated fund balance at the end of fiscal year 2010 was $547.3 million, which represents
approximately 22.6% of GAAP General Fund operating expenditures.
However, because the City is required to follow the statutory basis of accounting rather than GAAP for
determining the amount of undesignated fund balance that can be appropriated, it is the statutory (not the
GAAP) fund balance that is used to calculate “free cash.” Free cash is the amount of statutory fund
balance in the General Fund, as certified by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ Department of
Revenue, which is available for appropriation and is generated when actual revenues, on a cash basis,
exceed budgeted amounts and encumbrances are less than appropriations, or both.
The City has established the General Fund-Fund Balance Policy to ensure that the City maintains
adequate levels of fund balance to mitigate current and future risks (i.e., revenue shortfalls and
unanticipated expenditures). The policy in full states that the City shall maintain a GAAP undesignated
fund balance in the General Fund that is 10% or higher than the current fiscal year’s GAAP General Fund
operating expenditures; and that the City shall only consider the certification of free cash (as defined by
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ Department of Revenue) in years where the appropriation of free
cash shall not cause the fiscal year’s GAAP undesignated fund balance to go below 10% of the fiscal
year’s GAAP General Fund expenditures while maintaining a budgetary undesignated fund balance
between 5% and 10% of budgetary operating expenditures.
The City shall only consider the appropriation of certified free cash to offset: (1) certain fixed costs such
as pension contributions and related postemployment health benefits and/or (2) to fund extraordinary and
nonrecurring events as determined and certified by the City Auditor.
Special Revenue Fund – Fund Balance – The Special Revenue Fund accounts for the proceeds of
specific revenue sources that are legally restricted to expenditures for predefined purposes. The fiscal year

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
June 30, 2010
(Unaudited)
2010 Special Revenue Fund balance is reported at $173.1 million, a $7.7 million decrease from fiscal year
2009. This decrease is due to increased expenditures in federal grants.
Capital Projects Fund – Fund Balance – The Capital Projects Fund accounts for financial resources to
be used for the acquisition or construction of major capital facilities, other than those financed by
proprietary funds and trust funds. The fiscal year 2010 Capital Projects Fund balance is $45.3 million, a
$15.3 million increase from fiscal year 2009. The increase in fund balance is attributable to the excess
balance of unspent bond proceeds from the issuance of general obligation bonds to fund capital projects.
Other Governmental Funds – Fund Balance – Other Governmental Funds account for assets held by the
City in permanent trust funds. The fiscal year 2010 Other Governmental Funds fund balance is
$37.6 million, a $1.3 million increase from fiscal year 2009. The increase in fund balance is largely due to
the improvement in investment returns during fiscal year 2010.

Proprietary Funds
The City’s proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the Government-wide
Financial Statements for business-type activities. This information is presented on the same basis of
accounting, but in more detail.
The City’s proprietary funds net deficit for fiscal year 2010 was $37.2 million. The net deficit in the
proprietary funds is a result of the convention center special obligation bonds outstanding at year-end.

Budgetary Highlights
General Fund budgetary highlights include ending fiscal year 2010 with a $9.1 million surplus. This
represents the City’s 25th consecutive year with a balanced budget. One significant change from the
original budget to the final amended budget was in the area of public safety expenditures. The final
amended budget reflects additional amounts required to fund the firefighter’s retro-active pay, pursuant to
an arbitration agreement between the City and the local firefighters union.
Although the budgetary estimates for revenue exceeded actual receipts in fiscal year 2010, the revenue
deficit is due to a large decrease in state aid of $131.9. This number is skewed by the change in funding
structure of the teachers’ pension. When the change to teachers’ pension is considered, the decrease in
state aid was only $5.1 million. Favorable results were reported for other General Fund revenue sources.
Departmental and other revenue posted a $4.6 million favorable variance, while excises taxes posted a
$15.4 million favorable variance, largely due to an increase in meals and hotel room excise receipts.
The overall expenditure surplus of $113.3 million is also the result of the funding change in teachers’
pension, which is represented in the $126.4 million favorable variance for retirement costs. Additionally,
public works saw a $4.3 million surplus, largely attributable decreased costs for snow removal. However,
there was overspending in public safety and judgments and claims. Public safety deficits of $10.3 million
are generally due to overtime spending in the Police Department. Judgments and claims saw an increase
in settled claims creating a $12.5 million deficit.

CAPITAL ASSETS AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS
Capital Assets
The City’s investment in capital assets for its governmental activities, as of June 30, 2010, has a net book
value of $1.35 billion, made up of costs totaling $2.69 billion less accumulated depreciation of
$1.34 billion. This investment in capital assets includes land, buildings, improvements, equipment,
infrastructure, and construction in progress. Infrastructure assets are items that are normally immovable
and have value only to the City, such as roads, bridges, streets, sidewalks, drainage systems, lighting
systems, and similar items.
The total increase in the City’s investment in capital assets for the current fiscal year was approximately
4.9% in terms of net book value. However, actual expenditures to purchase or construct capital assets
were $136.5 million for the year. Most of this amount was used for the purpose of constructing or
reconstructing buildings and building improvements. Depreciation charges for the year totaled
$72.7 million. Additional information on the City’s capital assets can be found in note 8 of the Notes to
the Financial Statements.

Long-Term Obligations
Debt Administration – The authority of the City to incur debt is governed by federal and state laws that
restrict the amounts and purposes for which a municipality can incur debt. At year-end, the City had
$952.8 million in General Obligations Bonds principal outstanding – an increase of $36.0 million over
last year.
The key factor in this increase was the issuance of the March 18, 2010 Series A general obligation bonds
totaling $40.0 million exceeding principal repayments and the net effect of refundings. Further,
$68.4 million Series B was issued for the purpose of refunding certain outstanding general obligations of
the City. Additionally, the City took advantage of Federal programs made available by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, by issuing the 2009 QSCB Series A and 2010 Series
C-E bonds. The table below presents a summary of the savings from the ARRA bonds, versus a
traditional, tax-exempt issuance.

In March 2010, in conjunction with the City’s annual bond offering, the rating service bureaus Moody’s
Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s reaffirmed the City’s bond ratings at Aa1 and AA+,
respectively. Furthermore, in April 2010 Moody’s Investors Services began the recalibration of its longterm U.S. municipal ratings to its global rating scale, in order to be more in line with the ratings it issues

City of Boston, Massachusetts

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

(Unaudited)
for corporate debt. Accordingly, the City of Boston’s bond rating has been recalibrated from Aa1 to Aaa
by Moody’s on this new global ratings scale. General Obligation Bonds are backed by the full faith and
credit of the City, including the City’s power to levy additional taxes to ensure repayment of the debt.
Accordingly, all general obligation debt currently outstanding has been approved by a vote of the City
Council.
Notes and Leases Payable and Other Long-Term Obligations – The City’s general long-term notes and
leases and other long-term obligations increased by $147.9 million, or 19.2%, during the current fiscal
year. As in 2009, the key factor for this increase is the recognition of additional OPEB of $105.6 million.
Additional information on the City’s long-term debt obligations can be found in note 10 of the Notes to
the Financial Statements.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, the City adopted GASB Statement No. 51 (GASB 51),
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Intangible Assets, establishing accounting and financial reporting
for intangible assets. Examples of intangible assets are easements, patents, computer software either
purchased or internally generated. As with other capital assets, the useful life of an intangible asset must
be greater than one year. Intangible assets are classified as capital assets and are included in note 8. The
City has recognized intangible assets in the statement of net assets in accordance with GASB 51.
The City has also adopted GASB Statement No. 53 (GASB 53), Accounting and Financial Reporting for
Derivative Instruments, as of June 30, 2010. SBRS adopted GASB 53 as of December 31, 2009. The
adoption of this new standard did not have an effect on the City’s or SBRS’ beginning or ending net
assets.

FUTURE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
GASB has issued Statement No. 54, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions.
The objective of this pronouncement is to enhance the usefulness of fund balance information and provide
clearer fund balance classifications. Currently, fund balance is reported as restricted and unrestricted.
Effective for fiscal year 2011 reporting, fund balance will be reported as restricted, committed, assigned,
and unassigned based on the relative strength of the constraints that control how specific amounts can be
spent.

Reconciliation of the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and
Changes in Fund Balance of Governmental Funds to the Statement of Activities
Year ended June 30, 2010
(In thousands)
Net change in fund balances – total governmental funds

$

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of activities are
different because:
Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. In the statement
of activities, the cost of those assets is depreciated over their estimated useful
lives. Capital outlays ($136,529) exceeded depreciation expense ($72,656)
and disposals ($944).
Tax revenues in the statement of activities that are not reported as revenues in the
governmental funds
Proceeds of long-term debt ($212,837) increase long-term liabilities in the
statement of net assets, but are included in the operating statement of the
governmental funds. Repayment of bond, note, and lease principal ($106,998) and
payment to the escrow agent ($73,640) are expenditures in the governmental
funds, but reduce long-term liabilities in the statement of net assets. This is the
amount by which proceeds exceed repayments and escrow payments.
Bond premiums net ($4,011) increase the long-term liabilities in the statement of
net assets, but are included in the operating statement of the governmental
funds. Deferred losses on refunding ($1,819) decrease long-term liabilities in the
statement of net assets, but are included in the operating statement of the
governmental funds. Bond issuance costs, net ($649) are expenditures in the
governmental funds, but are deferred assets in the statement of assets. This is
the amount by which premiums and deferred losses on refundings exceeded
issuance costs.
Intergovernmental revenues decrease receivables on the statement of net assets,
but are included in the operating statement of governmental funds
Some expenses reported in the statement of activities do not require the use of
current financial resources and therefore are not reported as expenditures in the
governmental funds. This amount represents the increase in liabilities for
judgements and claims ($36,670), compensated absences ($3,676), other
postemployment benefits ($105,558) offset by a decrease in liabilities for pollution
remediation ($1,500), interest payable ($989), and the landfill liability ($124).
Net income from the internal service fund, which is presented in the statement
of activities, but not in the governmental funds
Change in net assets of governmental activities

City of Boston, Massachusetts
Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010

(1) The Financial Reporting Entity
The accounting policies followed in preparing the accompanying basic financial statements
are as follows:
(a) Primary Government
The City of Boston (the City), incorporated as a town in 1630 and as a city in 1822, now
exists under Chapter 486 of the Act of 1909 and Chapter 452 of the Acts of 1948 of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the Commonwealth), which, as amended, constitute
the City’s Charter. The Mayor is elected to a four-year term and serves as chief
executive officer of the City. The Mayor has general supervision of and control over the
City’s boards, commissions, officers, and departments. The legislative body of the City
is the City Council, which consists of 13 elected members serving two-year terms.
The accompanying basic financial statements present the City and its component units.
The component units discussed below are included in the City’s reporting entity because
of the significance of their operational or financial relationships with the City.
(b) Retirement System
The State-Boston Retirement System (SBRS) is a defined benefit contributory retirement
system created under state statute. It is administered by a Retirement Board comprising
five members: the City Auditor, who serves ex officio; two individuals elected by
participants in the system; a fourth member appointed by the Mayor; and a fifth member
chosen by the other members. The SBRS provides pension benefits to retired City,
Boston Redevelopment Authority, Boston Housing Authority, Boston Water and Sewer
Commission, Boston Public Health Commission, and the Suffolk County Sheriff
Department employees. Although legally separate, the SBRS provides services entirely,
or almost entirely, to the City and thus has been reported as if it were part of the primary
government; a method of inclusion known as blending.
(c) Discretely Presented Component Units Disclosure
These component units are reported in a separate column to emphasize that they are
legally separate from the City but are included because the City is financially
accountable for and is able to impose its will on the organizations. Unless otherwise
indicated, the Notes to the Financial Statements pertain only to the primary government
because certain disclosures of the component units are not significant relative to the total
component units and to the primary government. A description of the component units,
criteria for inclusion, and their relationship with the City are as follows:
Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) – The BRA is a public body politic and
corporate constituting the City’s redevelopment authority and exercising the powers
of a planning board for the City. The BRA is governed by a five-member board, four
of whom are appointed by the Mayor. Its purpose is to provide planning support for
major construction and redevelopment activity in the City.

City of Boston, Massachusetts

31

Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston (EDIC) – The
EDIC is a body politic and corporate and an instrumentality of the Commonwealth. It
is governed by the same persons appointed as members of the BRA board. The EDIC
has various powers to assist industrial development projects in the City and, together
with the BRA, assists the City with its economic development function.
Boston Public Health Commission (PHC) – The PHC is a body politic and
corporate and public instrumentality of the Commonwealth, established by
Chapter 147 of the Acts of 1995. PHC is governed by a seven-member board, six of
whom are appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council, and one of
whom is the chief executive officer of the Boston Medical Center (BMC). The PHC is
responsible for the implementation of public health programs in the City.
Trustees of the Public Library of the City of Boston (TPL) – The TPL is a
nonprofit organization qualified as a tax-exempt entity under Section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Trustees of TPL are appointed by the Mayor. The TPL was
established to benefit the public library system of the City.
The financial statements of the discretely presented component units are included for
their respective fiscal year ends, which is June 30, 2010.
Complete financial statements of these discretely presented component units can be
obtained through the City Auditor’s office, Room M-4, City Hall Plaza, Boston,
Massachusetts 02201. In addition, condensed financial statements for the discretely
presented component units are included in note 17.
(d) Related Organizations
The Mayor is also responsible for appointing members of the governing bodies of the
Boston Housing Authority, Boston Industrial Development Finance Authority, and
Boston Water and Sewer Commission; however, the City’s accountability for these
organizations does not extend beyond making these appointments.
(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies of the City conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles as applicable to governmental units as prescribed by the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The following is a summary of the more significant
policies followed by the City:
(a) Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements
The Government-wide Financial Statements (i.e., the Statement of Net Assets and the
Statement of Changes in Net Assets) report information on all of the nonfiduciary
activities of the primary government and its component units. For the most part, the
effect of interfund activity has been removed from these statements. Governmental
activities, which normally are supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues, are
reported separately from business-type activities, which rely to a significant extent on

32

City of Boston, Massachusetts
Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
fees and charges for support. Likewise, the primary government is reported separately
from certain legally separate component units for which the primary government is
financially accountable.
The Statement of Activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a
given function or segment is offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that
are clearly identifiable with a specific function or segment. Program revenues include
1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods,
services, or privileges provided by a given function or segment and 2) grants and
contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a
particular function or segment. Taxes and other items not properly included among
program revenues are reported instead as general revenues.
Separate financial statements are provided for Governmental Funds, Proprietary Funds,
and Fiduciary Funds, even though the latter are excluded from the Government-wide
Financial Statements. Major individual Governmental Funds and major individual
Enterprise Funds are reported as separate columns in the Fund Financial Statements.
(b) Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation
Government-wide Financial Statements
The Government-wide Financial Statements are reported using the economic resources
measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the Proprietary Fund and
Fiduciary Fund Financial Statements. The Agency Fund within the Fiduciary Fund has
no measurement to focus. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are
recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.
Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied. Grants
and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements
imposed by the provider have been met.
Amounts reported as program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants for
goods, services, or privileges provided, 2) operating grants and contributions, and
3) capital grants and contributions, including special assessments. Internally dedicated
resources are reported as general revenues rather than as program revenues. Likewise,
general revenues include all taxes.
Governmental Fund Financial Statements
Governmental Fund Financial Statements are reported using the current financial
resources measurements focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues
are recognized as soon as they are “susceptible to accrual” (i.e., both measurable and
available). Revenues not considered to be available are recorded as deferred revenue.
The City applies the susceptible to accrual criteria to property taxes and
intergovernmental revenues. In applying the susceptible to accrual concept to
intergovernmental revenues, there are essentially two types of revenues. In one,
resources must be expended on the specific purpose or project before any amounts will

City of Boston, Massachusetts

33

Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
be reimbursed to the City; therefore, revenues are recognized based upon the amount of
expenditures incurred. In the other, resources are virtually unrestricted and are usually
revocable by the grantor only for failure to comply with prescribed compliance
requirements. These resources are reflected as revenues at the time of receipt or earlier if
the susceptible to accrual criteria are met. Property taxes are recognized as revenue in
the year for which taxes have been levied, provided they are collected within 60 days
after year-end.
Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred. However, debt service
expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and judgments
and claims, are recorded only when payment is mature and due.
Proprietary Fund, Fiduciary Fund, and Component Unit Financial Statements
Private-sector standards of accounting and financial reporting issued prior to
December 1, 1989 generally are followed in both the Government-wide and Proprietary
Fund Financial Statements to the extent that those standards do not conflict with or
contradict guidance of GASB. Governments also have the option of following
subsequent private-sector guidance for their business-type activities and enterprise
funds, subject to this same limitation. The City has elected not to follow subsequent
private-sector guidance.
Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from nonoperating items.
Operating revenues and expenses generally result from the collection of revenue pledged
to repay debt. The principal operating revenues of the City’s enterprise funds are lease
receipts and excise taxes. The principal operating revenues of the City’s internal service
funds are receipts from employer and employee for health insurance premiums.
Operating expenses for enterprise funds and internal service funds include the interest,
administrative expenses, and vendor payments. All revenues and expenses not meeting
this definition are reported as nonoperating revenues and expenses.
Governmental funds – The City reports the following major governmental funds:
The General Fund is the City’s primary operating fund. It accounts for all financial
resources of the general government, except those required to be accounted for in
another fund.
The Special Revenue Fund accounts principally for the activities funded by federal
and state grant revenue sources and certain other revenues that are legally restricted to
expenditures for specified purposes.
The Capital Projects Fund accounts for bond proceeds and grant revenues used for
the acquisition or construction of the City capital facilities.

34

City of Boston, Massachusetts
Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
Proprietary Funds – The City reports the following major Proprietary Funds:
The Convention Center Bond Fund accounts for the City activities related to the
financing for the construction of a new state-owned convention center. Revenue debt
issued in connection with this fund is payable solely by specified local and state
receipts.
The Hospital Revenue Bond Fund accounts for the activities related to the Boston City
Hospital Revenue Bonds. These Bonds are payable solely from the mortgage note
payments received from the PHC. These Bonds are repaid from a pledged revenue
source from PHC.
Fiduciary Funds – Additionally, the City reports the following fiduciary fund types:
The Private-Purpose Trust Fund is used to account for resources legally held in trust
for the benefit of individuals, private organizations, or other governments. The City
operates four pools used for the improvement of the City’s parks and cemeteries,
educational scholarships and sporting equipment, creation of public utility and beauty,
and co-mingled nontestamentary trusts.
The Pension Trust Fund accounts principally for the activities of the State-Boston
Retirement System, a blended component unit, which accumulates resources for
pension benefit payments to retired City employees.
The OPEB Liability Trust Fund, is an irrevocable trust fund established for other
postemployment benefits. The assets are appropriated from the General Fund and
accumulate to reduce the unfunded actuarial liability of health care and other
postemployment benefits. This fund is currently not used for payments of benefits.
The Agency Funds are used to report funds held by the City in a purely custodial
capacity. The City currently operates a drug evidence account for proceeds from
property seized from illegal drug-related activities. These funds are then used to offset
the costs of technical equipment or expertise and investigations.
The City also uses an internal service fund to account for its self-insured health costs.
Although the fund is presented in a separate column in the accompanying basic financial
statements, it is not considered a major fund.
As a general rule, the effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the
Government-wide Financial Statements. However, interfund services provided and used
are not eliminated in the process of consolidation.
When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the City’s
policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are needed.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
(c) Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, investments with original maturities of
three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.
(d) Basis of Investment Valuation
Investments are presented in the accompanying basic financial statements at fair value.
Where applicable, fair values are based on quotations from national securities
exchanges, except for certain investments of SBRS, which are described in notes 5 and
11. Further, income from investments is recognized in the same fund as the related
investments.
The City invests in the Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust (MMDT), which is an
external investment pool and is not SEC-registered. The fund is state-regulated and is
valued at current share price.
(e) Interfund Receivables and Payables
Activity between funds that are representative of lending/borrowing arrangements
outstanding at the end of the fiscal year are referred to as either “due to/from other
funds” (i.e., the current portion of interfund loans) or “advances to/from other funds”
(i.e., the noncurrent portion of interfund loans). All other outstanding balances between
funds are reported as “due to/from other funds.” Any residual balances outstanding
between the governmental activities and business-type activities are reported in the
Government-wide Financial Statements as “internal balances.”
Advances between funds, as reported in the Fund Financial Statements, are offset by a
fund balance reserve account in applicable governmental funds to indicate that they are
not available for appropriation and are not expendable available financial resources.
(f) Uncollectible Tax and Other Receivables
All receivables are shown net of an allowance for uncollectibles. Amounts considered to
be uncollectible are based on the type and age of the related receivable.
(g) Capital Assets
Capital assets include property, plant, equipment, and infrastructure assets (e.g., roads,
bridges, sidewalks, and similar items), and intangible assets such as easements, land use
rights, computer software, trademarks and patents. Capital assets are reported in the
applicable governmental or business-type activities columns in the Government-wide
Financial Statements. Capital assets are defined by the City as assets with an initial,
individual cost of more than $25,000 and an estimated useful life in excess of two years.
Such assets are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical cost if purchased or
constructed. Donated capital assets are recorded at estimated fair market value at the
date of donation. Any significant construction commitments are encumbered at year-end
in the City’s Capital Project Fund.

36

City of Boston, Massachusetts
Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or
materially extend assets’ useful lives are not capitalized.
Capital assets of the primary government, as well as the component units, are
depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Assets
Buildings
Building improvements
Infrastructure
Land improvements – major
Land improvements – playgrounds
Computer upgrades
Equipment and machinery
Intangible assets, computer software and licenses

(h) Compensated Absences
Employees are granted sick and vacation leave in varying amounts. Upon retirement,
termination, or death, certain employees are compensated for unused sick and vacation
leave (subject to certain limitations) at their then current rates of pay. The portion of the
liability related to unused sick and vacation time that has matured or is due as of
June 30, 2010 is recorded in the Governmental Fund Financial Statements. The liability
for vacation leave is based on the amount earned but not used; for sick leave, it is based
on the amount accumulated at the balance sheet date (vesting method). The liability for
both amounts is calculated based on the pay or salary rates in effect at the balance sheet
date.
(i) Long-Term Obligations and Related Costs
Premiums, Discounts, and Issue Costs – In the Government-wide Financial
Statements, and proprietary fund types in the Fund Financial Statements, long-term debt
and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable governmental
activities, business-type activities, or proprietary fund type Statement of Net Assets.
Bond premiums and discounts, as well as issuance costs, are deferred and amortized
over the life of the bonds using the effective interest method. The unamortized portion is
presented in the Government-wide Statement of Net Assets. Bonds payable are reported
net of the applicable bond premium or discount. Bond issuance costs are reported as
deferred charges and amortized over the term of the related debt.
In the Fund Financial Statements, governmental fund types recognize bond premiums
and discounts, as well as bond issuance costs, during the current period. The face
amount of debt issued is reported as other financing sources. Premiums received on debt
issuances are reported as other financing sources while discounts on debt issuances are

City of Boston, Massachusetts

37

Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
reported as other financing uses. Issuance costs, whether or not withheld from the actual
debt proceeds received, are reported as debt service expenditures.
(j) Fund Equity
In the Fund Financial Statements, governmental funds report reservations of fund
balance for amounts that are not available for appropriation or are legally restricted by
outside parties for use for a specific purpose. Designations of fund balance represent
tentative management plans that are subject to change.
(k) Tax Abatement Refunds
Matured tax abatement refunds that are due and payable at June 30 have been recorded
as a liability in the General Fund. Other refunds have been recorded in the Governmentwide Statement of Net Assets.
(l) Landfill Closure and Postclosure Care Costs
State and federal regulations require the City to place a final cover on its Gardner Street
landfill site when it stops accepting waste and to perform certain maintenance and
monitoring functions at the site for 30 years after closure. At June 30, 2010, 100% of the
Gardner Street landfill site had been used and had not accepted solid waste for several
years. While most of the landfill closure construction was completed in prior years, there
still remains 12 acres of the landfill to be capped as of June 30, 2010.
The total current cost of landfill closure and postclosure care is an estimate, subject to
changes resulting from inflation, deflation, technology, or other changes in applicable
laws or regulations. Such costs are recognized as expenditures in the General Fund to the
extent that they are due or matured and are expected to be paid with expendable
available financial resources. The total liability is reported in the Government-wide
Statement of Net Assets. Expenditures related to the Gardner Street landfill site
postclosure care in fiscal year 2010 were $124 thousand.
(m) Use of Estimates
The preparation of the accompanying basic financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
(n) Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, the City adopted GASB Statement No. 51
(GASB 51), Accounting and Financial Reporting for Intangible Assets, establishing
accounting and financial reporting for intangible assets. Examples of intangible assets are
easements, patents, computer software either purchased or internally generated. As with

38

City of Boston, Massachusetts
Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
other capital assets, the useful life of an intangible asset must be greater than one year.
Intangible assets are classified as capital assets and are included in note 8. The City has
recognized intangible assets in the statement of net assets in accordance with GASB 51.
The City has also adopted GASB Statement No. 53 (GASB 53), Accounting and
Financial Reporting for Derivative Instruments, as of June 30, 2010. SBRS adopted
GASB 53 as of December 31, 2009. The adoption of this new standard did not have an
effect on the City’s or SBRS’ beginning or ending net assets.

(3) Short-Term Debt
During fiscal year 2010, the City had no short-term debt issued or outstanding.
(4) Budgetary Data
The General Fund is the only fund for which a budget is legally adopted. The budgets for all
departments included in the General Fund of the City, except the School Department, are
prepared under the direction of the Mayor and City Council. The School Department budget
is prepared under the direction of the School Committee.
Original and supplemental appropriations are submitted by the Mayor, approved by the City
Council, and lapse at year-end unless encumbered. The legal level of control over
appropriations is at the department level. Amendments to the original budget must be
approved by the City Council, except for a reallocation of appropriations of up to $3 million,
which the Mayor may approve. Further, the City Auditor, with the approval of the Mayor,
may make transfers from any appropriation to any other appropriation for purposes of
eliminating deficits before closing the books for the fiscal year. After the close of the fiscal
year, the City Auditor may, with the approval of the Mayor, apply any income, taxes, and
funds not disposed of and make transfers from any appropriation to any other appropriation
for the purpose of closing the accounts for the fiscal year. There was one supplemental
appropriation in the amount of $4.4 million required to fund firefighters retro-active pay,
pursuant to an arbitration agreement between the City and the local firefighters union.
The City must establish its property tax rate each year so that the resulting property tax levy
will comply with the limits required by Proposition 2-1/2 (note 6). The tax levy must equal
the sum of (a) the aggregate of all annual appropriations for expenditures; plus (b) the
reserve accounts described in the following paragraph; plus (c) provision for the prior fiscal
years’ deficits, if any; less (d) the aggregate of all nonproperty tax revenues projected to be
received by the City, including available funds, in amounts certified or approved by the
Commonwealth for tax rate purposes.
In accordance with the 1986 amendments to the Funding Loan Act of 1982, the City has
established two reserve funds. The first is a budget reserve fund, which is required to be
funded in stages to a final level of 2-1/2% of the prior year’s overall departmental
appropriations, except the School Department, by the beginning of fiscal year 1990. It is
available to be applied to extraordinary and unforeseen expenditures. The second is a

City of Boston, Massachusetts

39

Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
separate reserve fund of 1% to 2-1/2% of the current year appropriation of the School
Department to be applied to over expenditures in that department.
The City’s General Fund budget is prepared on a basis other than accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The “actual” results column in
the Statement of Revenues and Expenditures – Budgetary Basis – General Fund is presented
on a “budgetary basis” to provide a meaningful comparison of actual results with the budget.
The major differences between the budget and GAAP basis, where applicable, are that:
(a) Revenues are recorded when cash is received, except for real estate and personal
property taxes, which are recorded as revenue when levied (budget), as opposed to when
susceptible to accrual (GAAP).
(b) Encumbrances and continuing appropriations are recorded as the equivalent of
expenditures (budget), as opposed to a reservation of fund balance (GAAP).
(c) Certain activities and transactions are presented in separate funds (GAAP), rather than as
components of the General Fund (budget).
(d) Amounts raised for the prior years’ deficits and available funds from prior years’
surpluses are recorded as revenue items (budget), but have no effect on GAAP revenues.
In addition, there are certain differences in classifications between revenues, expenditures, and
transfers. The following reconciliation summarizes the differences between budgetary and
GAAP basis accounting principles for the year ended June 30, 2010 (in thousands):

(5) Deposits and Investments
State and local statutes place certain limitations on the nature of deposits and investments
available to the City. Deposits, including demand deposits, money markets, and certificates
of deposit in any one financial institution, may not exceed 60% of the capital and surplus of
such institution unless collateralized by the financial institution involved. Investments may
be made in unconditionally guaranteed U.S. government obligations having maturities of a
year or less from the date of purchase, or through repurchase agreements with maturities of
no greater than 90 days in which the underlying securities consist of such obligations. Other
allowable investments include authorized bonds of all states, bankers’ acceptances,
commercial paper rated within the three highest classifications established by rating
agencies, and units in the MMDT. The highest classifications for Moody’s and Standard &
Poor’s (S&P) are as follows:
Commercial Paper Credit Ratings
Moody's
S&P
Superior
P1
A1+ or A1
Satisfactory
P2
A2
Adequate
P3
A3

The Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts oversees the financial management of
the MMDT, a local investment pool for cities, towns, and other state and local agencies
within the Commonwealth. The City’s fair value of its investment in the MMDT represents
their value of the pool’s shares.
The City and its blended component unit apply GASB No. 40, Deposit and Investment Risk
Disclosures. The standard requires that entities disclose essential risk information about
deposits and investments.
Primary Government (except the pension trust fund)
(a) Custodial Credit Risk
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of bank failure, the City’s deposits may not
be returned. The City carries deposits that are fully insured by FDIC insurance, collateralized
and deposits that are not collateralized and are uninsured. As of June 30, 2010, the bank
balances of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits totaled approximately $386,000. All of
the City’s investments are held by third parties in the City’s name.
(b) Investment Policy
The City’s primary concern in connection with its investment activities is a concern shared
by all municipal governments: the preservation of capital. The City’s investment policy
establishes a domain in which all of the City’s investment activities may be safely conducted
while it strives to use its capital resources as efficiently as possible. The frontiers of that

City of Boston, Massachusetts

41

Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
domain are fixed by Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) c. 44, sec. 55, which prohibits
Massachusetts communities from investing in certain categories of high-risk investments;
limits the amount of the City’s bank deposits in any one financial institution; and establishes
qualifying criteria for banking institutions. Further, all investments held by third parties are
to be held in the City’s name.
(c) Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of
an investment. The following is a listing of the City’s fixed income investments
(in thousands) and related maturity schedule (in years) as of June 30, 2010:

(f) Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of
an investment or a deposit. As of June 30, 2010 the City held one international equity mutual fund
valued at $2.9 million.
State-Boston Retirement System (SBRS or the System)
(a) Custodial Credit Risk
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of bank failure, the System’s deposits may
not be returned. The System carries deposits that are fully insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance or collateralized with securities held by the System
or the System’s agent in the System’s name. The System also carries deposits that are not
collateralized and are uninsured. As of December 31, 2009, all of the System’s deposits were
insured or collateralized.
(b) Investment Policy
The provisions of M.G.L. c. 32, sec 23(2) govern the System’s investment practice.
Diversification is attained through varied investment management styles that comply with
Massachusetts state law. This is accomplished through the retention of investment managers
that adhere to M.G.L. c. 32, sec. 23(3), the “Prudent Person” rule.
The System has retained an investment consultant to work with the Retirement Board in a
fiduciary capacity to assure that strategic investment diversification is attained, to employ
investment managers with expertise in their respective asset classes, and to closely monitor
the implementation and performance of the respective investment strategies.
The System is currently invested in stocks (domestic and foreign), fixed income securities
(domestic and foreign), real estate, private equity, and hedge funds.

The System’s guidelines do not specifically address limits on maturities as a means of
managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. The
manager of each fixed income portfolio is responsible for determining the maturity and
commensurate returns of their portfolio.
The collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) held by the System as of December 31,
2009 are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.
(d) Credit Risk
The System allows investment managers to apply discretion under the “Prudent Person” rule.
Investments are made, as a prudent person would be expected to act with discretion and
intelligence, to seek reasonable income, preserve capital, and, in general, avoid speculative
investments.

In addition to the above schedule, the System has approximately $32.5 million invested in
U.S. government securities, which are not rated as they are explicitly guaranteed by the
U.S. government.
(e) Concentration Risk
The System has no investments, at fair value, that exceed 5% of the System’s net assets held
in trust for pension benefits as of December 31, 2009.
The System adheres to the provisions of M.G.L. c. 32, sec. 23(2) when managing
concentration risk.
(f) Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair
value of an investment or a deposit. Similar to the investments in domestic equities, the
System employs or encourages its investment advisor to employ diversification, asset
allocation, and quality strategies.
Risk of loss arises from changes in currency exchange rates. The System’s exposure to
foreign currency risk is presented on the following table (in thousands).

(g) Derivatives
The System trades financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of
its investing activities to assist in managing exposure to market risks. The financial
instruments include foreign currency forward contracts and purchasing and selling of when
issued securities. The fair value balances and notional amounts of derivative instruments
outstanding at December 31, 2009, classified by type, and the changes in fair value of such
derivatives for the year then ended as reported in the financial statements are as follows (in
thousands; debit (credit)):

The fair value of the investment derivatives are based on market prices.
(6) Property Taxes
Real and personal property taxes are based on values assessed as of each January 1. By law, all
taxable property must be assessed at 100% of fair cash value. Also by law, property taxes must
be levied at least 30 days prior to their due date. Once levied, these taxes are recorded as
receivables, net of estimated uncollectible balances. Property tax revenues have been recorded
using the modified accrual basis of accounting, described in note 2.
The City bills and collects its property taxes on a quarterly basis following the January 1
assessment. The due dates for those quarterly tax billings are August 1, November 1, February 1,
and May 1. Property taxes that remain unpaid after the respective due dates are subject to
penalties and interest charges.
Based on the City’s experience, most property taxes are collected during the year in which they
are assessed. Liening of properties on which taxes remain unpaid occurs annually. On
December 15, 2009, all properties with unpaid fiscal year 2009 property taxes were liened. The
City ultimately has the right to foreclose on all properties where the taxes remain unpaid.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
A statewide property tax limitation known as “Proposition 2-1/2” limits the amount of increase
in the property tax levy in any fiscal year. Generally, Proposition 2-1/2 limits the total levy to an
amount not greater than 2-1/2% of the total assessed value of all taxable property within the
City. Secondly, the tax levy cannot increase by more than 2-1/2% of the prior year’s levy plus
the taxes on property newly added to the tax rolls. Certain provisions of Proposition 2-1/2 can be
overridden by a Citywide referendum.
(7) Receivables
Receivables as of year-end for the government’s individual major funds, nonmajor funds, and
internal service fund, including the applicable allowances for uncollectible accounts, are as

(a) Long-Term Receivable
The City participates in the Commonwealth’s school building assistance program, which is
administered by the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA). The MSBA
provides financial assistance (up to 90% of total costs) to the City to build and/or renovate
schools. As of June 30, 2010, under this program, the City was due funds totaling $74.8
million.
In the General Fund, the receivable is offset by deferred revenue because the revenue is not
considered available. The following is a schedule of the five-year paydown (in thousands) as
of June 30, 2011 through 2015, and in five-year increments thereafter:

(b) Notes Receivable
Section 108 is the loan guarantee provision of the Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) program. Section 108 provides communities with a source of financing for
economic development, housing rehabilitation, public facilities, and large-scale physical
development projects. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides grants to local
governments, which in turn provides loans to developers. As of June 30, 2010, under this
program, the City determined that $65.7 million was collectible. This amount is recorded in
the City’s Special Revenue fund.
Governmental funds report deferred revenue in connection with receivables for revenues that
are not considered to be available to liquidate liabilities of the current period. Governmental
funds also defer revenue recognition in connection with resources that have been received,
but not yet earned. At the end of the current fiscal year, the various components of deferred
revenue and unearned revenue reported in the governmental funds were as follows
(in thousands):
Unavailable

On October 28, 2009, the City issued $20,000,000 of Qualified School Construction Bonds
(QSCBs) offered under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), which allows
the City to issue the bonds at a tax credit against their federal income tax liability. The principal
of the bonds are payable quarterly, until maturity in fiscal year 2024, and are net of a $302,500
quarterly tax credit.
On March 18, 2010, the City of Boston sold its Series A through D, General Obligation Bonds
and on March 25, 2010 sold its $17,415,000 Series E QSCBs. Through the implementation of

Federal programs made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the
City of Boston was able to issue the series C, D, and E taxable bond issues at attractive interest
rates. In each of the programs, the City receives reimbursement from the federal government for
some or all of the interest expense. The QSCB offered in October, 2009 and the Series C General
Obligation bonds both require repayment through the establishment of sinking funds. The City
will establish the sinking funds as required.

The revenue refunding bonds of the Boston City Hospital (BCH) do not constitute general
obligations of the City and the annual debt service of these bonds has been assumed by PHC.

City of Boston, Massachusetts

55

Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
PHC expects to meet its obligation on the bonds through application of a portion of the rent
payable to the PHC by the BMC for its lease of the former BCH. Under certain circumstances,
including a default by BMC under the lease, City revenues may be required to satisfy the debt
service requirements on the Series B bonds.
The City has pledged future mortgage note payments from the PHC, to repay $127.8 million in
special obligation refunding bonds issued in August 2002. Proceeds from the bonds originally
provided financing for the construction of Boston City Hospital. The bonds are payable solely
from mortgage note payments received from the PHC and are payable through 2019. Annual
principal and interest payments on the bonds are expected to require 100 percent of the mortgage
note repayments. The total principal and interest remaining to be paid on the bonds is $99.3
million. Principal and interest paid for the current year and mortgage note repayments received
were $11.1 million and $11.3, respectively.
The City has pledged future taxi medallion sales and state hotel/motel fees (pledged revenues) to
repay $116.9 million in special obligation bonds issued in April 2002. Proceeds from the bonds
provided financing for the City’s activities related to the financing for the construction of the
state-owned convention center. The bonds are payable solely from the pledged revenues and are
payable through 2027. Annual principal and interest payments on the bonds are expected to
require 25 percent of the pledged revenues. The total principal and interest remaining to be paid
on the bonds is $140.6 million. Principal and interest paid for the current year and pledged
revenue receipts received, net of the $30.0 million transfer to the general fund, were $8.3 million
and $13.9 million, respectively.
No Obligation Debt
The City has outstanding industrial, commercial, and housing development bonds payable solely
from revenues of the respective enterprises that do not constitute an indebtedness of the City and
are not charged against its general credit. This aggregate amount is immaterial to the financial
statements.
Defeased Debt
The principal amount of debt refunded through in-substance defeasance transactions for both
governmental and business-type activities and still outstanding at June 30, 2010 was
approximately $164.9 million.
Debt Capacity
The City is subject to a dual general debt limit: the normal debt limit and the double debt limit.
Such limits are equal to 5% and 10%, respectively, of the valuation of taxable property in the
City as last equalized by the State Department of Revenue. Debt may be authorized up to the
normal debt limit without state approval. Authorizations under the double debt limit, however,
require the approval of the Commonwealth’s Secretary of Administration and Finance.

Additionally, there are many categories of general obligation debt, which are exempt from the
debt limit but are subject to other limitations.
As of June 30, 2010, the City may issue $4.04 billion of additional general obligation debt under
the debt limit. General obligation debt of $467.7 million, subject to the debt limit, and
$80.5 million, exempt from the debt limit, are authorized but unissued as of June 30, 2010.
(11) Retirement Plans
(a) Plan Description
The City contributes to the SBRS, a cost sharing multiple employer defined benefit pension
plan. The System provides retirement, disability, and death benefits to plan members and
beneficiaries of the following government units:
(1) City of Boston
(2) Boston Redevelopment Authority
(3) Boston Housing Authority
(4) Boston Water and Sewer Commission
(5) Boston Public Health Commission
(6) Suffolk County Sheriff Department
On January 1, 2010, in accordance with Chapter 61 of the Acts of 2009, the Suffolk County
Sheriff’s Department and their respective retirement annuity savings funds were transitioned
to the Commonwealth. Furthermore, retirees who retired as employees of the Suffolk County
Sheriff’s Department prior to January 1, 2010, will remain members of the System and the
respective pension liability will remain the obligation of the City. Due to a collective
bargaining agreement, a limited number of employees retain the ability to retire as members
of the System until November 1, 2010.
Chapter 32 of the M.G.L assigns authority to establish and amend benefit provisions of the
plan to the state legislature.
The System is administered by a five person Board of Retirement consisting of the City
Auditor, who serves as a member ex officio, two members who are elected by the
participants, in or retired from the service of the System, a fourth member appointed by the
Mayor, and a fifth member chosen by the other members. A complete set of financial
statements for SBRS for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 can be obtained through
the SBRS, Boston City Hall, Room 816, Boston, MA 02201.
.
(b) Basis of Accounting
The System’s financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Plan
member contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are due.

City of Boston, Massachusetts

57

Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
Employer contributions to the plan are recognized when due and the employer has made a
formal commitment to provide the contributions. Benefits and refunds are recognized when
due and payable in accordance with the terms of each plan.
Investments of the System are stated as follows:
(1) Bonds are stated at quoted market value.
(2) Equity securities are stated at quoted market value.
(3) Real estate funds are stated at appraised value or partner’s account value, whichever is
more readily determinable.
(4) Venture capital funds are stated at contributed cost or fair market value, whichever is
more readily determinable.
(5) International investments are stated at quoted market value and are included in equities
and fixed income categories.
(6) Cash is stated at carrying amount, which is reconciled book balance.
(c) Membership
Membership in the System consisted of the following at December 31, 2009, the date of the
latest actuarial valuation:
Retirees and beneficiaries receiving benefits
Terminated plan members entitled to but not receiving benefits
Active plan members
Total membership
Total number of participating employers

13,894
10,172

(d) Contributions
Plan members are required to contribute to the System. Depending on their employment
date, active members must contribute a range of 5% – 9% of their regular gross
compensation. Members hired after December 31, 1978 must contribute an additional 2% of
regular compensation in excess of $30,000. Participating employers are required to pay into
the System their share of the remaining System-wide actuarially determined contribution,
which is apportioned among the employers based on active covered payroll. The
contributions of plan members and the participating employers are governed by Chapter 32
of the M.G.L. The City’s required and actual contributions to the System for the year ended
June 30, 2010 was $116 million. For years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 the City’s required
and actual contributions were $213 million, $203 million or $108 million and $105 million,
net of teachers’ retirement, respectively.

City of Boston, Massachusetts
Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
On May 22, 2010, the Commonwealth enacted Chapter 112 of the Acts of 2010 which
resulted in significant changes in the funding of pension benefits and related assets held for
the benefit of City of Boston Teachers (Boston Teachers) employee group and how that
group is administered. The Legislation stipulated that the Commonwealth is now
responsible for the Boston Teachers pension liability and the funding requirements thereto
required. Further, the Legislation stipulated that the System was to continue administering
the membership and retiree activities related to the Boston Teachers.
The Legislation also stipulated that the assets attributable to the Boston teachers would be
invested in the Commonwealths Pension Reserves Investment Trust (PRIT) Fund. However,
that investment would be considered an asset of the System. In order to fund this asset, the
System was required to liquidate certain positions, rebalance the portfolio as necessary, and
remit approximately $1.04 billion to PRIT.
During the fall of 1997, the System’s Retirement Board, the City Council, and the Mayor
approved the option for local funding of cost-of-living adjustments. As a result, a locally
funded cost-of-living adjustment of 3.0% on the first $12,000 of a retiree’s annual payment
was awarded first in fiscal year 2001 and each year following. These cost-of-living
adjustments will be awarded by the Retirement Board each year, except in years in which the
Retirement Board determines that such an adjustment would substantially impair the funding
schedule.
(e) Legally Required Reserve Accounts
The balance in the System’s legally required reserves (on the statutory basis of accounting)
at December 31, 2009 is as follows (in thousands):

All reserve accounts are funded at levels required by state statute.
(f) Securities Lending
The Public Employment Retirement Administration Commission of Massachusetts
(PERAC) has issued supplemental regulations that permit the System to engage in securities
lending transactions. These transactions are conducted by the System’s custodian, which

City of Boston, Massachusetts

59

Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
lends certain securities owned by the System to other broker dealers and banks pursuant to a
form of loan agreement. The System and the borrowers maintain the right to terminate all
securities lending transactions on demand.
At the System’s direction, the custodian lends the System’s securities and receives cash
(including both U.S. and foreign currency), U.S. government securities, sovereign debt of
foreign countries, and irrevocable bank letters of credit as collateral. The custodian does not
have the ability to pledge or sell collateral unless the borrower defaults. Borrowers are
required to deliver cash collateral in amounts equal to not less than 100% of the market
value of the loaned securities.
The System does not impose any restrictions on the amount of securities lent on its behalf by
the custodian. There were no failures by any borrowers to return loaned securities or pay
distributions thereon and there were no losses from a default of the borrowers or the
custodian for the year ended December 31, 2009. The cash collateral received by the
custodian on each loan was invested, together with the cash collateral of other qualified taxexempt plan lenders, in a collective investment pool. The relationship between the average
maturities of the investment pool and loans was affected by the maturities of the loans made
by other plans that invested cash collateral in the collective investment pool, which the
System could not determine. At December 31, 2009, the System had no credit risk exposure
to borrowers because the amounts the System owed the borrowers exceeded the amounts
owed to the System.
At December 31, 2009, the fair value of securities loaned by the System amounted to $323.8
million, against which was held collateral of $336.0 million as follows (in thousands):

Noncash collateral

$68 million of additional funding to venture capital funds.
(h) Funded Status and Funding Progress
The funded status of the System as of January 1, 2008, the most recent actuarial valuation
date, with an updated liability projection as of January 1, 2010, is as follows (in thousands):

In the January 1, 2008 actuarial valuation, the individual entry age normal actuarial cost
method was used. The actuarial assumptions included an 8.0% investment rate of return,
projected salary increases of 5.0%, and cost-of-living adjustments of 3.0% up to $12,000
annually. The actuarial value of assets was determined using the fair value of investments.
The System’s unfunded actuarial accrued liability is being amortized as a level percentage of
pay on an open basis. The remaining amortization period at January 1, 2010 was 14 years.
The schedule of funding progress, presented as Required Supplementary Information (RSI)
following the notes to the financial statements, presents multiyear trend information about
whether the actuarial value of plan assets are increasing or decreasing over time relative to
the actuarial accrued liability for benefits.
(12) Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB)
GASB Statement No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for
Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires governments to account for OPEB,
primarily healthcare, on an accrual basis. The effect is the recognition of an actuarially required
contribution as an expense on the Government-wide Statement of Activities when a future retiree
earns their postemployment benefit. To the extent that an entity does not fund their actuarially
required contribution, a postemployment benefit liability is recognized on the Government-wide
Statement of Net Assets over time.
In addition to the pension benefits described in note 11, the City provides postemployment
healthcare and life insurance benefits, in accordance with state statute and City ordinance, to
participating retirees and their beneficiaries. Participating retirees are City retirees. As of June
30, 2009, the valuation date, approximately 14,000 retirees and 15,000 active members meet the
eligibility requirements as put forth in Chapter 32B of M.G.L. The City sponsors and participates
in an agent multi-employer defined benefit OPEB plan. The OPEB plan is administered by the
City and does not issue a stand-alone financial report.
Medical and prescription drug benefits are provided to all eligible retirees not enrolled in
Medicare through a variety of plans offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts,
Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, and Neighborhood Health Plan. Medical and prescription drug
benefits are provided to retirees enrolled in Medicare through supplemental and Medicare

Advantage plans offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim
HealthCare, and Tufts Health Plan.
Groups 1 and 2 retirees, including teachers, with at least 10 years or 20 years of creditable
service are eligible at age 55 or any age, respectively. Group 4 retirees with at least 10 years or
20 years of creditable service are eligible at age 45 or any age, respectively. Retirees on
accidental disability retirement are eligible at any age, while ordinary disability requires 10 years
of creditable service. The surviving spouse is eligible to receive pre and postretirement death
benefits, as well as medical and prescription drug coverage.
(a) Funding Policy
Employer and employee contribution rates are governed by the respective collective
bargaining agreements. The City currently funds the plan on a pay-as-you-go basis. The
City and plan members share the cost of benefits. As of June 30, 2009, the valuation date,
the plan members contribute 10% to 25% of the monthly premium cost, depending on the
plan in which they are enrolled. The City contributes the balance of the premium cost.
(b) Annual OPEB Cost and Net OPEB Obligation
The City’s annual OPEB expense is calculated based on the annual required contribution of
the employer (ARC), an amount actuarially determined in accordance with the parameters of
GASB Statement No. 45. The ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing
basis, is projected to cover the normal cost each year and amortize any unfunded actuarial
liability over a period of 30 years. The following table shows the components of the City’s
annual OPEB cost for the year ended June 30, 2010, the amount actually contributed to the
plan, and the change in the City’s net OPEB obligation based on an actuarial valuation as of
June 30, 2009 (in thousands):

Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of reported amounts
and assumptions about the probability of occurrence of events far into the future. Examples
include assumptions about future employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend.
Amounts determined regarding the funded status of the plan and the annual required
contributions of the City are subject to continual revision as actual results are compared with
past expectations and new estimates are made about the future. The schedule of funding
progress, presented as required supplementary information following the Notes to Basic
Financial Statements, presents multiyear trend information that shows whether the actuarial
value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued
liabilities for benefits.
In January 2009, the Commonwealth adopted Chapter 479, which amends Chapter 32B and
allows local municipalities to establish an OPEB liability trust fund and a funding schedule
for the trust fund. On October 1, 2009, the City Council approved the establishment of a
irrevocable OPEB trust fund and $20 million was transferred to the fund.
(d) Actuarial Methods and Assumptions
Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the substantive plan (the
plan as understood by the City and plan members) and include the types of benefits provided
at the time of each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing of benefit costs between the
City and plan members to that point. The actuarial methods and assumptions used include
techniques that are designed to reduce short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and
the actuarial value of assets, consistent with the long-term perspective of the calculations.

The City also adopted M.G.L. Chapter 32B, Section 18A for future retirees effective July 1,
2010. This provision requires Medicare eligible retirees to enroll in a Medicare supplement
plan upon reaching age 65. As a result, the actuarial assumptions for participation and
coverage election changed, as presented in the following table, reducing the City’s OPEB
AAL by $937 million from the June 30, 2007 valuation.

The projected unit credit cost method was used. The actuarial assumptions included a 5.25%
investment rate of return and an annual healthcare cost trend rate of 10.0% to 11.0%
initially, reduced by decrements to an ultimate rate of 5.0% after 5 – 6 years. The healthcare
cost trend rate differs between the master medical and other healthcare plans. The actuarial
value of assets was determined using the market value of investments. The City’s UAAL is
being amortized as a level percentage of pay on an open basis. The remaining amortization
period at July 1, 2009 was 30 years.

The excess expenditures reported above are allowed under the budgetary laws governing the
City.
(15) Public Health System
Effective July 1, 1996, the City’s Department of Health and Hospitals and Trustees of Health
and Hospitals were abolished. Substantially all their assets and liabilities, including title to the
City’s two hospitals, BCH and Boston Specialty and Rehabilitation Hospital (BSRH), were
transferred to and assumed by PHC.
Also effective July 1, 1996, the operations of BCH and BSRH were consolidated with the
operations of the Boston University Medical Center under the licensure and control of the BMC.
The PHC receives the majority of its funding from federal and state grants, lease agreements
with BMC, and a City appropriation. During fiscal year 2010, the City appropriated $70.0
million to the PHC. As described below, the PHC uses the appropriation to pay debt service on
certain general obligation bonds and base assistance grant payments to BMC. The remainder of

City of Boston, Massachusetts

Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010
the appropriation is used for administrative purposes and to support the various public health
programs run by the PHC. The City has budgeted $69.8 million for the PHC for fiscal year 2011.
Due from PHC/BMC
On July 1, 1996, in connection with the consolidation transaction described above, the PHC
assumed a liability of $149.8 million for a mortgage note due to the City. In August 2002, this
note was refinanced such that the stream of payments made by the PHC on the new note will be
used to pay the outstanding balance of $122.9 million of the City’s Special Obligation Refunding
Bonds dated August 2002. The PHC receives funding for the note payments from the BMC
under a lease agreement whereby the BMC leases portions of the former BCH for an initial
period of 50 years. Rental payments received under this lease are equal to the debt service costs
on the new note and on all City general obligation bonds allocable to BCH. In fiscal year 2010,
the City received $7.2 million in principal and $3.9 million in interest for a total of $11.1 million
from PHC in payments for this note. These general obligation bonds were issued by the City
between December 1967 and October 1995 and total $7.5 million at June 30, 2010. These bonds
pertain to the property and operations of the BCH Campus, South Block Campus, BSRH
Campus, Emergency Medical Services Operations, and the Long Island Campus.
In addition, the PHC and BMC are also responsible for reimbursing the City for health
insurance, equipment lease payments, workers’ compensation, and other miscellaneous expenses
paid for by the City.
Payments to BMC
PHC is obligated to make future base assistance grant payments to BMC of $10.8 million each
year through fiscal year 2019.
(16) Risk Management
The Risk Management Program focuses on a planned strategy of self-insurance, supported by
strong prevention and cost reduction efforts, financial reserves and catastrophic insurance. The
City is self-insured in most areas of risk including general liability, property and casualty,
Workers’ Compensation, certain employee health care costs and unemployment compensation.
The City’s legal liabilities are capped per M.G.L. Chapter 258, and Corporation Counsel defends
the City in any lawsuits that arise from the normal course of operations. For Workers’
Compensation, the City is exempt from state insurance requirements per M.G.L. Chapter 152
Section 25B. The City’s Workers’ Compensation Division, as well as the Police and Fire
Departments, manage employee injury claims internally. The City budgets for and funds legal
claims and employee injury costs through the General Fund, charging specific departments for
their share of costs in order to promote awareness and prevention efforts.

City of Boston, Massachusetts
Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2010

The City purchases health insurance coverage for employees and retirees through a variety of
health maintenance organizations (HMO’s), in addition to offering three self-insured indemnity
plans, which are administered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts (BC/BS). HMO
costs are funded through the General Fund, and the self-insured plans are financially managed
through a trust fund established in compliance with M.G.L Chapter 32B Section 3A.
For unexpected large losses, the City maintains a catastrophic risk reserve, which has an
available balance of $12.5 million at the end of fiscal 2009. To further protect the City’s assets
and finances from adverse loss, commercial insurance is purchased strategically for certain
exposures. A catastrophic property insurance policy provides $100.0 million all risk protection
after a $10.0 million deductible. Boiler and machinery losses are insured up to $10 million per
incident, after a $50,000 deductible.
The City has established a liability based on historical trends of previous years and attorney’s
estimates of pending matters and lawsuits in which the City is involved. Changes in the self
insurance liability for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 are as follows
(in thousands):

the total of a provision for events of the current fiscal year and any change in the provision for
events of the prior fiscal years.
There are numerous pending matters and lawsuits in which the City is involved. The City
attorneys estimate that the potential claims against the City not recorded in the accompanying

THE BOSTON ECONOMY
The City is the twenty-first largest city in the United States and the economic hub of The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Commonwealth”) and the New England region. It is a center for
professional, business, financial, governmental, higher educational and medical services, as well as for
transportation, communications, export, cultural and entertainment activities. As a government center, the
City is the capital of the Commonwealth and is host to several federal regional offices. High technology,
research and development, financial services, manufacturing, and wholesale distribution also contribute to
the economy of the City and its suburbs.
In 2009 the City had a population of 645,169, as estimated by the U.S. Department of Commerce
Bureau of the Census (the “Bureau of the Census”), and had 668,748 jobs, as stated in a series for Boston
consistent with the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (the “Bureau of
Economic Analysis”) for Suffolk County pro-rated for Boston (employment in 2010 is estimated at
652,180). The ratio of jobs to population indicates that the City provides a direct source of employment and
income for an area that extends well beyond its borders. Measured in terms of jobs, the City’s economy
comprises approximately 16.2% of the Massachusetts economy and 7.4% of that of the six New England
states.
Overview of Recent Economic Conditions
The City of Boston’s economy experienced moderate growth from 2004 through much of 2008.
Employment in the city of Boston grew by 7.9% over those four years. In the spring of 2008, as the
national economy began to experience rising unemployment and more rapidly deteriorating economic
conditions, Boston still showed some signs of growth. However, in late 2008 Boston began to show signs
of a weakening labor market and the same deteriorating conditions then prevalent in the rest of the country.
Currently, the U.S. unemployment rate is higher than Boston’s, the nation’s level of job loss has been
greater, and although Boston’s real estate markets have been experiencing rising vacancy rates and a
correction in prices, it is still outperforming most other major real estate markets in the U.S.
Unemployment rates in Boston, which had been as low as 3.9% as recently as April of 2008, reached
9.3% in January 2010.The national unemployment rate, which was in the 4.3% to 5.0% range throughout
2007, reached 10.6% in January 2010. Massachusetts and New England also had higher unemployment
rates than the City of Boston, 10.4% and 10.0% respectively, in January 2010. As of November 2010
Boston’s unemployment rate was 7.9%, compared to 8.1% for Massachusetts and 9.3% for the US.
Boston’s commercial real estate market experienced a downward shift beginning in the last half of 2008
through the present. Similarly, hotels after several years of improving performance also showed weakening
numbers in 2008 and 2009, but recovered strongly in 2010 as revenue per available room grew by 11.9%
compared to the previous year. The housing market in Boston, hurt by rising foreclosures and the tight
lending market, has experienced weakened sales volumes and small to moderate drops in prices. Boston,
however, has not experienced the same level of price declines experienced in many other large markets
across the U.S.
Statistical Data
Statistical data relating to population, employment and income are derived primarily from five
separate sources: the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. Department of
Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (the “Bureau of Labor Statistics”), and the City and the Boston
Redevelopment Authority (the “BRA”), each of which is described below.
The U.S. Census Bureau publishes information about population, housing and the economy. The
most recent decennial Census data remains the 2000 Census. In addition to that, some monthly, quarterly
and annual data are available through December 2010 on certain topics for the region, the Commonwealth,
and Metropolitan Boston. The Bureau of the Census now has the American Community Survey which
provides city level data beyond 2000 and through 2009 for some variables on a citywide basis but not for
neighborhoods or census tracts. The only 2010 Census data now available is for U.S. and state totals.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis publishes quarterly and annual statistics on income and
employment. The most recent annual figures for the nation, New England, Massachusetts is for 2009; and
for Metropolitan Boston and Suffolk County the latest data are for 2008. The most recent quarterly national
statistics are for the fourth quarter of 2009. The City accounts for approximately 87% of Suffolk County’s
population and approximately 96% of its employment.

2

The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes data and reports about the workforce and related subjects
including unemployment rates, area wages, and cost-of-living adjustments. Final annual data for 2010
exists for some but not all variables the most recent monthly data are for December 2010.
The City and the BRA prepare reports and compile data on the population and economy of the City
and its neighborhoods. The BRA also provides data and trends obtained from various local, regional, state
and national sources from both the public and private sectors on such topics as employment and
occupations, large employers, City schools, universities and colleges, medical institutions, tourism and
lodging, transportation, office and industrial markets, housing, building activity and urban redevelopment
and infrastructure projects.
The statistical data contained in this report do not necessarily reflect current activity because of
delays resulting from the time required to collect, tabulate and publish such data. While the City believes
that it has used the most recent available data in this report, the data contained herein may not reflect
current conditions or trends because of such delays. Moreover, statistical data are approximations and
generalizations subject to various sources of error inherent in the statistical process, and may be revised on
the basis of additional data. The statistical data contained herein describes past activity and are not
presented in order to suggest the continuation of any trend, or to predict future economic activity either in
particular categories or in general.
Population, Income and Employment
Boston’s population for 2009 was estimated by the U. S. Census Bureau to be 645,169 which showed
an increase of 9.5% from the count of 589,141 in 2000. The U.S. Census Bureau also estimates 2009
population data for states and metropolitan areas. The population of Metropolitan Boston for July 1, 2009 is
estimated to have been 4,588,680, an increase of 197,366 residents from the 2000 census, a gain of 4.5%.
The population of Massachusetts for the 2010 Census enumeration as of April 1, 2010 as reported in
December 2010 was 6,547,829, a gain of 3.1% over that for April 2000.

Hampshire (Rockingham and Strafford), which together comprise the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy MA-NH Metropolitan
Statistical Area; as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
(2) The 2010 population for Massachusetts only was released in December 2010 showing 6,547,829, a 3.1% rise over the decade.
Source: U.S. Census Bureau, January 2011.

The 2000 Census showed that Boston’s racial composition was: White, Non-Hispanic 49.5%; Black,
Non-Hispanic 23.8%; Hispanic 14.4%; Asian/Pacific Islander 7.5%; Multi-racial 3.1%; other single race
1.4%; and Native American 0.3%. The American Community Survey for Boston for 2005-2009, from the
U.S. Census Bureau, shows that the racial make-up of the City has not changed significantly from the 2000
Census, but does indicate that the proportions of Hispanic and Asian City residents are slightly higher while
the proportion of Black, Non-Hispanic City residents is down slightly.
According to the 2009 American Community Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau, Boston continues
to be a city of young adults due to the large number of students and young adults living and working in the
City. One out of every three persons in Boston is between 20 and 34 years old. The population aged 35 to
54 years increased significantly, to 25%, as that cohort aged and continued to show a preference for city
living. Boston’s elderly population (aged 65 and over) grew slightly between 2000 and 2009 as that
segment rose by 6% or 3,707 people to 10.1% of the population. Boston’s children and teens (aged 0 to 19)
has stayed almost constant, decreasing by -0.5% or 693 persons and at 21.6% of the population. The trend
toward fewer families of related people living together and to more non-family households comprised of
single persons and roommates, continued in Boston. There was also a trend toward more “non-traditional”
families as the data showed more relatives and non-relatives other than the householder and spouse living
in families. Overall, the total number of households edged marginally lower. Single-person households

Employment Structure, Employment Trends and Occupational Changes
The economy of Metropolitan Boston rests primarily on high technology, finance, professional and
business services, defense, and educational and medical institutions. The City’s economy is more
specialized in the financial, governmental, business and professional services, and educational and medical
sectors, than the suburban economy, which is more specialized in high technology and the defense industry.
The table below shows Boston’s employment growth by industry category for 2008, 2009, and 2010.
The industry categories are in the North American Industrial Classification System (“NAICS”) format,
which the Bureau of Economic Analysis began using in 2001. Employment data from the Bureau of
Economic Analysis is through 2008. Suffolk County data is mathematically reduced to the Boston
geography using unemployment insurance coverage data (Employment Security, ES-202, for cities and
towns from the Massachusetts Department of Workforce Development, “DWD”, and County Quarterly
Employment and Wages “CQEW” from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for Counties and States).
Employment trends for 2008 through 2009 for Boston show that 21,306 jobs were lost, a 3.1%
decline. Between 2009 and 2010 job loss totaled 6,566 based upon preliminary data, a decrease of 1.0%.
Most losses over the past year were in administrative services (temporary employment), banking, securities
and financial investments, construction, government, architectural – engineering – design services and
wholesale trade. Largest gains were evident in health care; insurance; educational services; food service
and drinking places; and management – scientific – technical services. Most of the other industries showed
either marginal losses or marginal gains.

2008 through October 2008 after which employment began to decline relative to the previous year. From
November 2008 through May 2010 employment fell each month,. Beginning in June 2010 employment has
grown monthly from the previous year indicating that economic growth had returned. By December 2010 a

The following table indicates that, as of 2009, 68% of City residents were white-collar workers and
32% were blue-collar and service workers, as compared to 1970 when 55% were white-collar workers and
45% were blue-collar and service workers. The trend among City residents away from blue-collar and
service occupations and toward white-collar occupations was evident between 1970 and 2009 (this trend
actually began prior to 1970; in 1960 only 44% of City residents worked in white collar jobs). Between
2000 and 2009, the proportion of white collar workers in the City actually declined slightly while bluecollar jobs, particularly for services occupations increased, although production and transportation workers
was slightly lower. Data are from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 2009 one-year
estimates.

1990-2000 from the decennial census reports, U.S. Census Bureau. 2009 from U.S. Census Bureau, “American Community
Survey, 2009” one-year estimates.

Unemployment
In 2009, Boston’s unemployment rate was 8.1%, better than the 9.3% national rate. Metropolitan
Boston, Massachusetts and New England had rates at 7.8%, 8.4%, and 8.3%, respectively. All of these rates
were above the rates for 2008. The 2009 unemployment rate from the American Community Survey
(“ACS”) for Boston, which differs from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) data due to sample size,
accuracy in defining the persons in the labor force, and over-counting the officially unemployed, showed
that when Boston’s total unemployment rate from BLS equaled 8.1% the rate from the ACS for all adults
was 11.2%, the rate for all whites equaled 6.7%,the rate for all minority groups equaled 17.3% and the
unemployment rate for all youth, aged 16 to 24, was 21.0%.

rising unemployment rates but by the last six months of 2010 unemployment rates were improving
compared with those for the same months of the previous year. Increasing unemployment rates became
evident in the U.S. economy beginning in December 2007 while rising unemployment rates in New
England, Massachusetts, and Boston became evident starting in May 2008 and rising through early to mid2010. By December 2010, Boston’s unemployment rate of 7.5% was, however, significantly lower than the
U.S. rate of 9.1%, while rates for Metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts, and New England were 7.1%, 8.0%
and 8.0%, respectively.

In addition to private employers, the public sector has large numbers of employees in the City.
According to a preliminary estimate by the BRA, using a series consistent with the Bureau of Economic
Analysis, there were an estimated 77,737 federal, state and local government workers in the City in 2010
according to a preliminary estimate. Certain large state government offices, federal regional offices, U.S.
Postal Service facilities, state-chartered authorities and commissions (such as the Massachusetts Port
Authority and the Boston Water and Sewer Commission), and the City’s local government agencies and
departments, are located within the City.
Labor Force and Education
According to the Bureau of the Census, the City’s resident labor force has been steadily increasing
from 1980 through 2008. Since 1980, the increase in the number and age of the population have combined
with the rising labor force participation of women, minorities, youth and the elderly to produce a larger
labor force overall. Bureau of the Census data show that by 1990, the City’s population had increased by
2% over 1980 levels, while the City’s labor force increased by 12.8%. During the 1990’s Boston’s
population continued to rise, posting a 2.6% increase while the age 16+ labor force grew by 3.2%. And,
from 2000 through 2009 Boston’s population rose by 9.5% and the labor force grew by 27.1%.
9

General improvement in educational attainment of residents aged 25 and over continued throughout
the 1980-2009 period. The percentage of this population that had completed four or more years of college
more than doubled during this period from 20.3% to 44.7%. This change, in part, reflected the trend for an
increasing percentage of Boston public school system graduates to seek higher education. This percentage
increased from 62% in 1993 to 73% in 2006 (source: “Getting to the Finish Line: College Enrollment and
Graduation – A Seven Year Longitudinal Study of the Boston Public Schools Class of 2000,” by the Center
for Labor Market Studies of Northeastern University, November 2008). Improving educational attainment
levels and shifting occupational patterns suggest a concurrent transformation of the City’s work force as the
City’s economy has moved to a service-dominated employment base.
The City supports entry-level and advanced job training programs, including the following: Englishas-a-Second Language training, pre-vocational and vocational training, adult literacy training, and support
counseling. In 2009, the Jobs and Community Services division (“JCS”) of the BRA, the City’s workforce
development agency, provided job training to 503 adults and employed 6,883 youth in publicly-supported
summer jobs. Linkage contributions paid into the Neighborhood Jobs Trust provide a supplemental source
of funding for job training programs. For a full discussion of the City’s housing and jobs linkage program
see “The Linkage Program,” below.

Income, Wages, and Cost of Living
Per capita personal income for Suffolk County was $52,276 in 2008, 30% above the national per
capita personal income of $40,166, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. City residents constitute
approximately 87% of the County’s population. An historical summary of per capita income shows that
from 1980 to 1990 Suffolk County’s per capita income grew at a rate greater than that for the nation, in
contrast to the 1970-1980 period when it rose at a slower rate. Suffolk County’s per capita income grew at
a faster rate than the per capita income growth rates for the United States, New England, and Massachusetts
and just barely below the rate of growth for Metropolitan Boston between 1990 and 2000. The City’s
median household income (in current year dollars), based on Census data, rose from $12,530 in 1980 to
$29,180 in 1990, $39,629 in 2000, and $55,979 in 2009. The figures in this paragraph and the chart directly
below reflect earned income of persons residing in the named areas plus rents, interest and other unearned
income and transfer payments from governmental entities. As such, these figures take into account certain
income sources not included in the survey of average annual wages in the following paragraph, which
reflects earned income of persons who work (but do not necessarily reside) in the named areas.

Medical and Higher Educational Institutions
Boston’s medical and educational institutions are an important component of its economy, providing
employment opportunities for residents of the City and Metropolitan Boston. Expenditures by the
institutions’ patients, students and visitors stimulate the City’s trade and service sectors.
Twenty two inpatient hospitals are located within the City. The largest of these are: Massachusetts
General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Children’s
Hospital, Tufts New England Medical Center, and Boston Medical Center. All together the 22 hospitals had
a combined total of 6,453 beds in 2009 according to the most recent data from the American Hospital
Association. In 2009, the hospitals admitted 247,642 in-patients and had over 5.9 million outpatient visits,
according to data from the American Hospital Association (with four hospitals not reporting data other than
beds). The City is also the home of the medical and dental schools of Harvard, Tufts and Boston
Universities, and of twenty-five public neighborhood health clinics, as well as private health maintenance
organizations and membership clinics.
In 2010, there were 123,209 health services jobs in the City.” Health services represent nineteen out
of every one hundred jobs within the City. Growth in the health services sector remained strong even
during slower economic conditions of 2008-2010. Data from this employment series showed that the
number of hospital employees in Boston between 2008 and 2010 grew from 80,762 to 86,002.
From 2008 through early 2011, four hospital and one medical laboratory building projects were
completed: the Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s 350,000 square-foot Shapiro Cardiology Center in 2008;
the St. Elizabeth Hospital’s 45,000 square foot Emergency Department/Urgent Care Facility in 2009; the
Boston Medical Center BioSafety Level 4 (BSL4) laboratory (construction is completed but use is currently
limited to office and training purposes pending further approvals) in 2010; the Boston Medical Center
245,000 square-foot Shapiro Ambulatory Care Building (NACB) in early 2011; and the Dana Farber
Cancer Institute’s 275,000 square-foot Yawkey Center for Cancer Care, also in 2011.
As of February 2011, four hospital projects and one medical-student housing development are under
construction, including Massachusetts General Hospital’s 530,000 square foot, 150-bed, Building for the
Third Century; the Brigham and Women’s Hospital MMHC (Massachusetts Mental Health Center) with
633,960 square feet of research, clinical (136 beds), office and residential uses; the new Spaulding
Rehabilitation Hospital building with 221,000 square feet of space and 132 beds in the former Charlestown
Navy Yard; Children’s Hospital Main Inpatient Building expansion of 112,000 square feet with 30 beds;
12

and the Boston Medical Center’s 442,800 square foot Albany Fellows building with 104 housing units for
medical students.
For fourteen consecutive years between 1995 and 2008, Boston has been the highest-ranking city in
the United States for the receipt of National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant awards, receiving more than
$1.62 billion in research grants during fiscal 2008 when Boston’s share of the nation’s competitively
awarded NIH funding stood at 7.8%. Boston’s hospitals continue to attract NIH awards; Boston has the top
five independent hospitals in the nation as ranked by total awards, and a total of seven out of the top
fourteen recipients.
The Boston metropolitan area remains the nation’s foremost region for the life sciences industry
according to a 2009 Milken Institute study. The life sciences industry includes biotechnology,
pharmaceuticals, life sciences R&D, medical devices, health-care services, and supporting industries; it is a
sector with very strong projected economic growth potential with high-paying jobs and other economic and
fiscal benefits. Greater Boston is in first place in the 2009 Milken Institute Overall Composite Index Life
Science Cluster with a score of 100. In the first part of the Index, the Current Impact Composite Index
(measuring therapeutics and devices, health services, and supporting industries) Boston had a score of 91.
In the Innovation Pipeline Index (research and development capacity, risk capital and entrepreneurial
infrastructure, human capital, workforce and innovation output) Greater Boston is in first place with a score
of 100. In the third sub-component, the Small Business Vitality Index, Boston placed third among the top
cities with a score of 87.4. As measured by employment the Milken Report lists Boston metropolitan area
employment with 377,112 total jobs in the Life Sciences Cluster for 2007 (244,603 in health care services;
45,089 in therapeutics and devices; 42,331 in the life sciences supporting industries; 23,251 in R&D
research and development in the life sciences; 13,214 in medical devices; 5,249 in biotechnology; and
3,375 in pharmaceuticals).
Boston and Cambridge are the hubs for the life sciences industry in the Greater Boston Area as the
two key centers of the cluster-- Longwood Medical Area in Boston and Kendall Square in Cambridge -- sit
on each side of the Charles River. Both cities attract life sciences companies and research institutions. Due
to this proximity, there is always a collaborative relationship between the companies or institutions,
depending on their area of work and research, even when they are located in the adjacent city. Recently, the
Mayor of Boston welcomed several new life science companies that moved to Boston: EvaluatePharma
from UK, Kowa Company from Japan, Intelect Medical from Cleveland, and Novophage from
Cambridge. All combined, these companies are bringing over 40 jobs with the potential to grow even more
in the future. Also, there currently are a few larger life sciences companies looking into consolidating their
operations in Boston.
From 2007 through 2010 eleven major higher education academic projects were completed in
Boston, including projects for: Harvard UniversityUniversity; Simmons College; Tufts University Dental
School; the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy; Suffolk University; UMass-Boston; Emerson College;
Emmanuel College; Berklee College of Music;the Harvard Arboretum; and the Boston Conservatory of
Music. As of February 2011 two higher education academic building projects are in construction and four
academic campus buildings are approved but not yet underway.
In addition, between 2000 and year-end 2010, 29 dormitories with 10,421 dormitory beds (9,671
undergraduate and 750 graduate) opened to house Boston’s college students. As of February 2011, two
more dormitories are under construction, two dormitory halls are approved and two are under review.
While college enrollment grows, completion of new student residences is pulling students out of
neighborhood housing, easing housing prices and ameliorating tight vacancies.
Tourism and Culture
According to the Greater Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau (“CVB”) and the Massachusetts
Office of Travel and Tourism, an estimated 19.3 million people visited the Boston metropolitan area in
2009, up by 5.5% from the previous year. These visitors included both domestic and international visitors.
For the whole metropolitan region the total number of visitors was 23.6 million. International visitors alone
to Boston-Cambridge in 2009 totaled 1.1 million persons or a gain of 2% over that of 2008. The estimated
spending impact in Boston-Cambridge from the total visitors was $7.18 billion. In 2009 there were 12.2
million visitors at 24 major museums, attractions, and related venues, an increase of 0.1% over the 2008
mark. The latest data for Suffolk County indicates that in the county alone the total domestic direct traveler
impact in 2009 was $5.78 billion, supporting 39,830 jobs and a payroll of $1.21 billion, while generating
$152.7 million in state tax receipts and $103.9 million of local tax receipts.

The City of Boston is home to three major professional sports teams: the Boston Red Sox baseball
team, the Boston Bruins hockey team, and the Boston Celtics basketball team. The New England Patriots
football team plays in Gillette Stadium in nearby Foxborough, Massachusetts. The City also provides
venues for concerts, ice shows, circuses, theater, and other entertainment performances and amateur sports
events. The TD Garden, opened in 1995 and home to the Celtics and Bruins, is a privately-financed, multipurpose arena in Boston’s North Station district constructed by the New Boston Garden Corporation, a
subsidiary of Delaware North. The ownership of the Boston Red Sox baseball franchise have undertaken
renovations of the existing Fenway Park, including the addition of new seating and modernizing facilities,
and have also proposed additional changes to the existing structure and also in the surrounding
neighborhood.
Boston ranks among the Top 10 destinations in North America for conventions, meetings, and trade
shows, based on the number and quality of the shows booked. Boston currently has three main convention
sites—the John B. Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center (“Hynes”), the Seaport World Trade
Center, and the 2.1 million-square-foot Boston Convention & Exhibition Center (“BCEC”), the largest
building in New England and capable of hosting large national and international events. In 2010 the Hynes
and the BCEC hosted a combined total of 236 events with an aggregate of 756,087 attendees. This resulted
in approximately 584,005 hotel room nights, approximately $451.1 million in direct spending,
approximately $36.6 million in direct tax revenue, and generated an overall economic impact of
approximately $664.5 million, according to the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority.
Since 2000, several cultural facilities have opened: the New England Aquarium completed an
expansion including opening the Simons IMAX Theater in 2001; the Boston Center for the Arts and the
Huntington Theatre combined to complete the joint development of two new theaters next to the Boston
Center for the Arts in the South End in 2004—the first new live stage theaters in Boston in 75 years;
downtown, Clear Channel, Inc. completed its $22.0 million renovation of The Boston Opera House on
Washington Street in 2004; a newly constructed Institute of Contemporary Art museum opened on the
South Boston waterfront in 2006; the Emerson College renovation of the Paramount Theater opened in
2009; and the Suffolk University renovation of The Modern Theater was finished in 2010. and The
Museum of Fine Arts recently completed and opened its “Art of the Americas” wing, a 462,400 square-foot
multi-phase expansion. Also, the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum has begun an expansion of its facilities.
In May, 2005 the Mayor launched CreateBoston, an economic development program at the BRA that
is designed to help creative businesses and entrepreneurs to achieve their full potential for success. The
program focuses on film, music, design, digital media, visual arts/crafts and performance, and provides
resources in financial and site location assistance, workforce development and business advocacy; and is
geared specifically toward business development and job creation. Currently, the program focuses on
strengthening and growing digital media and specifically the Boston-area videogame industry. In 2008, the
Mayor established the first Boston-area Game Industry Steering Committee that meets monthly to address
the issues and challenges facing the industry and further the BRA’s effort to raise Boston’s profile as a
global leader in the game industry.
On March 13, 2009 the Mayor launched the first Game Industry Website. Following the 2007
“PoweringUpBoston” conference on workforce development funded in-part by the Mass Cultural Council
(MCC), area videogame companies annual revenues have increased to approximately $2 billion and several
colleges and universities have since launched master’s degree programs in game design and interactive
multimedia and game engineering. CreateBoston in partnership with MCC, the steering committee,
academic institutions, game companies and game organizations hosted a second Powered Up Conference
and Expo on business development on October 14 – 15, 2010 in the city’s Innovation District.
Hotel Market
Between July 1997 and December 2009, Boston built 7,020 rooms in 33 new hotels and 5 hotel
expansions. Boston’s favorable hotel market and the decision to build the BCEC stimulated considerable
new development over this period. Since 1992, Boston’s annual occupancy rates have exceeded 72% in 16
out of the 19 years.
From 2004 through 2008, the following hotels were completed: an 81-room Courtyard by Marriott in
the Back Bay; the Hotel Onyx, a 112-room Kimpton hotel near North Station; the Hampton Inn at
Crosstown, in Roxbury; The Back Bay Hotel, a 220-room hotel in the Back Bay; the Bulfinch Clarion
Hotel, an 80-room adaptive reuse development near North Station; a 164-room Courtyard by Marriott in
the South Bay/Roxbury district; the 40 room Hotel 140 in the Back Bay; the 793-room Westin BCEC
Headquarters Hotel, attached to the BCEC in South Boston; the 424-room Intercontinental Hotel on the
14

downtown waterfront; the 308-room Liberty Hotel, which includes the adaptive reuse of the historic
Charles Street Jail; the 471-room Marriott Renaissance on the South Boston waterfront; the 150-room
Battery Wharf Fairmount on the downtown waterfront; the 149-room Mandarin Oriental, in the Back Bay;
and the 16-room Inn @ St. Botolph. Two hotels opened in 2009: the 114-room Ames Hotel, an adaptive
reuse of an historic office building near Government Center, and the 235-room “W” Hotel in the Theater
District. As of December 2010, there were a total of 18,447 hotel rooms in establishments of fifty or more
rooms in Boston.
Between 1991 and 2000, average annual occupancy rates grew from 70.1% to 78.4% and average
daily room rates rose steadily from $118.17 to $198.00 according to Pinnacle Advisory Group, an
independent hospitality industry consultant. In 2001 the occupancy rate fell to 69.6% and the room rate to
$180.58. By 2003 hotel room demand was growing again, but room supply continued its steady growth too,
resulting in a 71.1% occupancy rate and $155.52 average daily rate in that year. Between 2003 and 2008
Boston room demand grew by 27.2% over these five years and 2008 occupancy reached 74.6% with
average daily rates averaging $213.94. Revenue per available room was $159.54 in 2008, just below the
high mark of $159.95 reached in 2007. Room demand fell 3.7% in 2009, reducing annual average
occupancy to 70.8% and the average room rate declined by 13.1% to $186.01. Revenue per available room
fell 17.4% to $131.79. Boston hotel room demand revived in 2010, growing 4.7% and lifting occupancy to
75.5%, average room rates to $195.31 and raising revenues per available room by 11.9% to $147.53,
according to the Pinnacle Advisory Group.
The tables below show the occupancy rate, average daily room rate, and revenue per available room
for Boston hotels for 1990, 2000 and 2003 through 2010.

Transportation
The City is a major national and international air terminus, a seaport, and the center of New
England’s rail, truck and bus service. The City is served by three limited-access interstate highways which
connect it to the national highway system: U.S. 90 (the “Massachusetts Turnpike”), which leads westward
from downtown Boston 138 miles to the New York State border; U.S. 95, the East Coast’s principal northsouth highway, which connects Boston to Portland, Maine to the north and New York City and
Washington, D.C. to the south; and U.S. 93, another north-south interstate highway, that extends from just
south of the City north to New Hampshire. The City is also served by two national railroads, Amtrak and
Conrail, a regional rail carrier, Boston and Maine (a subsidiary of Guilford Transportation Industries), and
Bay Colony, a local carrier.
Transportation planning includes both major highway and mass transit programs. The Massachusetts
Bay Transportation Authority (“MBTA”) provides commuter rail, subway, local bus and express bus
services to 175 cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts, offering public transit to a population of almost
4.7 million people in an area of 3,200 square miles. The MBTA, the fifth largest mass transit system in the
nation as determined by ridership, currently serves about 1.2 million passengers per day.
The MBTA’s draft FY12-FY16 Capital Investment Program includes $4.51 billion in capital
spending to reinvest in its transportation infrastructure and to build expansion projects. The Capital
Investment Program consists of five major programmatic areas: (i) reinvestment in the infrastructure ($2.27
billion); (ii) accessibility improvements ($270.6 million); (iii) enhancement of existing service ($341.1
15

million); and (iv) system expansion efforts ($25.7 million). The major infrastructure projects include:
vehicles ($989.4 million); station modernization ($201.3 million); rail signaling systems ($161.4 million);
track/right-of-way ($197.9 million); bridges ($141.0 million); technology, other ($64.8 million); power
($292.7 million; maintenance facilities, including rail car houses and bus garages ($62.6 million); fare
equipment ($20.2 million); administration facilities ($133.3 million); and communications ($8.6 million).
Boston’s South Station, one of three major high speed rail terminals on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor
(NEC), currently hosts high speed intercity passenger rail (HSIPR), including Amtrak Acela Express and
Northeast Regional services. It is also the terminus for Amtrak’s Lake Shore Limited service between
Boston and Chicago. The MBTA also operates commuter rail, subway, and guideway bus services at the
station. The station’s Bus Terminal is the hub for private intercity and regional motor coach carriers in
eastern Massachusetts.
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) was awarded federal funding of $32.5
million on October 28, 2010 for environmental clearance and preliminary design for an expansion of South
Station, The South Station HSIPR Expansion Project will advance the design, and complete state and
federal environmental permitting, to expand South Station from its current 13 current terminal platform
track configuration to 20 total platform tracks. The HSIPR Expansion Project would enable faster and more
efficient operations, as well as planned increases in both Amtrak and MBTA commuter rail services.
For a description of the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project see “Large Public Sector
Projects,” below.
Seaport and Airport
The Massachusetts Port Authority (“Massport”) was created by the state legislature to develop and
manage the City’s major air and sea transportation centers. Massport is financially independent, and the
City is not responsible for any debt or other obligations incurred by Massport. Heavy use of Boston Logan
International Airport (“Logan Airport”) and the Port of Boston have compelled significant expansion of
both facilities. Massport’s net investment in its facilities through June 2010 exceeded $4.14 billion,
consisting of $3.70 billion invested in airports and $438.3 million invested in maritime development and
other capital projects.
In February 2011, Massport projected that it would spend about $1.02 billion during fiscal years
2011-2015 for ongoing capital improvements and major maintenance at Logan Airport, Hanscom Field,
Worcester Airport, and the port facilities.
The Port of Boston serves the six-state New England region as a natural deep-water port supporting
import and export of containerized bulk and general cargo and providing ship repair supply services,
customs and international freight forwarding services intermodal cargo warehouse facilities, and other
maritime support services. Massport’s Conley Container Terminal provides all-water access to world ports
as well as a weekly barge service to the Port of New York/New Jersey. The Port of Boston is also a major
cruise port. The total number of cruise passengers in fiscal 2010 (310,482) increased by 12.7% compared to
fiscal 2009. The cruise port mainly operates in the months of May through November.
The Port of Boston ranked as the 12th largest container port on the U.S. Atlantic Coast by container
volume. During fiscal 2010, the Port activity of 100,970 boxed containers decreased 12.0% over that of
fiscal 2009, while the 38,208 automobiles handled in fiscal 2010 increased by 23.0% from fiscal 2009 and
the 89,394 tons (in bulk tonnage) for fiscal 2010 decreased by 46.8% from fiscal 2009’s bulk tonnage.
In calendar 2010, Logan Airport served a total of 27.4 million passengers, a 7.2% increase from the
25.5 million passengers served in 2009. A report on calendar year 2009 prepared by Airports Council
International (“ACI”) showed that Logan was the most active airport in New England, the 19th most active
in the United States and the 43rd most active in the world. Logan Airport also plays an important role as a
center for processing domestic and international air cargo. In fiscal 2010, total combined cargo and mail
volume was 563.2 million pounds, a 1.4% decrease from the 571.2 million pounds handled in fiscal 2009.

Construction Activity
The following table sets forth construction activity in the City from fiscal years 2001-2011, estimated
as indicated in the notes to the table. It should be noted that the issuance of a building permit and payment
of a fee do not necessarily result in construction activity. The estimated revenue from building permit fees
during fiscal 2011 (based on seven months of data) indicated that total construction activity is projected to
total $3.16 billion, after only a significant slowdown in fiscal 2010, because of the recession. In the past ten
fiscal years beginning with 2002 revenue from building permit fees increased seven times and decreased
three times. Preliminary annual fiscal 2011 building permit revenue returned to about the same level as
registered in fiscal 2009 after the drop in fiscal 2010. .

Large Public Sector Projects
In addition to major construction projects of the MBTA and Massport, Boston has witnessed several
other major public sector projects including the BCEC Project and the Central Artery/Tunnel (“CA/T”), the
downtown highway tunnel through the City including the Ted Williams tunnel under Boston Harbor. The
CA/T Project, which has improved traffic flow in Boston since its completion, is under the control of the
Massachusetts Turnpike Authority.
The CA/T Project includes the Ted Williams Tunnel, connecting Logan Airport and the North Shore
to Downtown Boston and the western suburbs, the Leverett Circle Connector Bridge, a four-lane bridge
over the Charles River carrying traffic between Leverett Circle in downtown Boston and U.S. 93 in
Charlestown, the extension of U.S. 90 under Fort Point Channel to South Boston connecting with the
highway with the Ted Williams Tunnel and Logan Airport in East Boston, and the Central Artery and the
Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge over the Charles River. The CA/T Project, with an estimated total
cost of $14.63 billion, was funded in part by the federal government while the remainder was the
responsibility of the Commonwealth.
The BCEC Project was constructed on a 60-acre site in South Boston through the joint efforts of the
City, the Commonwealth, the BRA, and the MCCA. The 2.1 million square-foot facility, was completed in
2004 and includes approximately 516,000 square feet of contiguous exhibition space on one level,
approximately 160,000 square feet of meeting space and a 40,000 square-foot ballroom, as well as banquet
and lecture halls. The BRA was authorized by the Convention Center Act to acquire and prepare the site for
the BCEC Project and now the MCCA is the owner and operator of the BCEC. In 2010 the BCEC hosted
conventions with 399,054 attendees and since opening in late 2004 has hosted over 2.5 million
conventioneers. In addition to the BCEC Project, a 793-room convention center hotel on the northeast
corner of the BCEC Project site opened in June 2006.
17

The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (“MWRA”), an independent state authority has also
spent approximately $1.50 billion on improvements to its wastewater system and approximately $1.71
billion on its waterworks system through June 30, 2010. The largest expenditures have been for the
MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel, the John J. Carroll Water Treatment Plant, improved water storage
facilities and reduction of combined sewer overflows.
The MWRA-approved FY11 Capital Improvement Program anticipates the spending of
approximately $662.3 million on additional water and wastewater system improvements between Fiscal
Year 2011 and Fiscal Year 2013, and $1.50 billion in 2014 and beyond. The largest expenditures will be for
the combined sewer overflow (CSO) control plan, interceptor and pumping improvements and water
distribution system improvements. The largest component of the combined sewer overflow control plan is
the North Dorchester Bay CSO Storage Tunnel and related facilities. Relatively small portions of the other
improvements are located within the City, but they should nonetheless provide major improvements in the
system infrastructure that serves the City.
The City prepares a 5-7 year Capital Plan. These capital investments represent improvements to
schools, libraries, parks and recreation sites, roads and bridges, and other City properties. See “City
Indebtedness—Capital Planning and Borrowing Program” in the City’s Information Statement dated as of
March 1, 2011.
Office Market and New Development
The City and its inner neighborhoods currently have approximately 60.3 million square feet of office
space. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Boston’s overall vacancy rate according to Jones Lang LaSalle
was 11.6% (and 17.8% availability when including space to sublet). Another realty firm, Colliers Meredith
& Grew, placed the City’s office availability rate at 16.6%. Boston’s vacant and available space has been
increasing since mid-year 2008. Jones Lang LaSalle puts the annual 2010 office absorption at a positive
179,431 square feet of space while Colliers Meredith & Grew measured negative 748,792 square feet of
annual absorption. The principal reason for the difference between these two assessments is differing
conventions for the timing of major new leases. From the third quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2010
Boston’s office vacancy rate rose from 6.9% to 11.6% according to Jones Lang LaSalle.

Jones Lang LaSalle, Fourth Quarter 2010.

There is no accepted standard accounting for office vacancy rates so private realty firm surveys vary
based upon the amount of office space covered, geographical coverage, and inclusion of new or old office
space.
Despite the worsening picture of office market data, Boston still compares favorably to other
downtown office markets around the nation. As of the fourth quarter of 2010, Cushman & Wakefield
ranked Boston’s downtown office market as having the ninth best vacancy rate among the twenty largest
downtown office markets in the U.S. with a rate of 12.0%.

From 2006 through 2009 downtown office projects included: Lincoln Plaza, a renovation of an
existing building in the South Station sub-market to mixed uses with 119,000 square feet of office space;
Atlantic Wharf, a 517,000 square foot building in the downtown waterfront; and Two Financial Center, a
214,000-foot building in the South Station district. In 2010 the 500,000 square foot One Marina Park Drive
at Fan Pier in the South Boston Seaport District was completed. In February, 2011 Weston Associates also
completed their renovation of the existing 38,852 gross square foot structure at 90 Smith Street in Mission
Hill, which will provide office space for the Harvard School of Public Health.
As of February 2011, one office building is under construction and several office buildings had been
approved by the BRA Board. The project now in construction is the 660,000 square foot Russia Wharf at
540 Atlantic Avenue on the downtown waterfront. In 2010, Commonwealth Ventures received approval to
preserve and rehabilitate both the approximately 50,000 square foot, six-story building located in Boston’s
Seaport District for office uses, research and development uses, a business incubator space for “clean tech”
businesses, and related uses (e.g., alternative energy testing), and an approximately 22,700 square foot,
three-story building for office purposes.
Retail Market
For 2010, based on two quarters of data, it is estimated that there are about 68,663 employees in retail
stores, and food service and eating and drinking establishments in the City, with 30,681 in retail, and
37,982 in food service and eating and drinking. In 2007, according to the Census of Retail Trade, about
2,157 retail establishments were located in the City with estimated total sales of $6.81 billion. The food
service and eating and drinking establishment industry in Boston (restaurants and bars) consists of an
additional 1,986 establishments with $2.35 billion in sales. The sector is rounded out by some 14,000
employees in the personal service businesses, which includes repair and maintenance, hair and nail care,
and laundry and dry cleaning service. The 2007 Census of Retail Trade data was released in January of
2010 and is only done once every five years.

There are now 19 neighborhood business districts operating within the City’s Main Streets Program.
This program is a public-private initiative of the City established in 1995 to revitalize neighborhood
commercial districts through locally established organizations. The program, from its inception through the
end of fiscal year 2010, generated 900 net new and expanded businesses, created 5,569 net new jobs,
assisted in 753 storefront improvement projects, and given design assistance to 893 businesses. Through
calendar year 2010, the Main Streets Program had dispensed almost $2.2 million in total physical
improvement grants which had leveraged more than $11.2 million in private investment, a leverage ratio of
5.5 to 1.
Also of importance are the supermarket developments that have taken place throughout Boston’s
neighborhoods. Twenty-three new or expanded supermarkets have opened in Boston’s neighborhoods since
1992.
Industrial Market and Recent Developments
Boston and Suffolk County have 27.2 million square feet of industrial space. (Source: “The Co-Star
Industrial Report, Year-End 2010”). As of December 2010, there were 3.4 million square feet of industrial
space vacant, a vacancy rate of 12.4%, with +25,000 square feet of net absorption over the year. The
average rent for quality industrial space was $9.27 per square foot (triple net), and $8.38 per square foot for
warehouse space, and $12.36 for flex space.
The BRA’s Back Streets Program, established in 2001, continues to attract, retain, and grow Boston’s
viable industrial and commercial businesses and their diverse job base through the strategic use of land,
workforce and financial resources. In 2010, Back Streets successfully assisted over 50 companies, and
created or retained 495 jobs. Back Streets helped companies such as F.W. Webb and Company, Roxbury
Technologies, Intralinks, and Sky Zone find new space to expand in Boston. These companies alone
account for over 800,000 square feet of new space in the City. By working with Back Streets, these
programs had access to financing options, real estate expansion sites, workforce development and
permitting assistance.
Housing Stock, Housing Values, and Development
The number of housing units in Boston as of 2009 from the American Community Survey had
reached over 266,000. The percentage of owner and renter occupied units according to the 2009 American
Community Survey was 37.2% and 62.8%. The number of vacant units was 26,722 while the vacancy rate
for owner and renter housing were 2.3% and 6.0%, respectively. The Census data from the 2009 American
Community Survey put the monthly cost for home owners with a mortgage at $2,229 and the monthly rent
for existing renters (as opposed to advertised rents) of $1,196 per month.
A report on 20010 real estate trends done by the City’s Department of Neighborhood Development
showed that the median rent for an apartment in Boston in 2010 as advertised in the newspapers was $1,500
per month for all apartment types. Rents were down 14.3% citywide from those of 2009, when the average
was $1,750. Median rents for an apartment ranged from a high of $2,500 in the Back Bay/Beacon Hill
district to a low of $1,063 in Hyde Park.
Existing home prices in Greater Boston peaked in 2005 and declined through 2009 but showed a gain
in 2010. The National Association of Realtors reported that the median sales price of existing homes in
20

Metropolitan Boston (the MSA but excluding the New Hampshire segment) was $357,300 for 2010, a
13.5% decrease over the high annual median sales price of $413,200 recorded in 2005, but up by 7.4% over
the 2009 median sales price.

The prices in the above table exempt all sales of properties of less than $25,000 because the low price sales are not
considered to be “arms-length” transactions and the high price sales can distort averages.
Data in the above table does not include “paired-sales” so the size, quality and type of houses sold vary from year-to-year.
Sales volume eliminates those sales mentioned in note 1 and also eliminate sales for properties that were not able to be

Condominium sales volume and prices also showed variability across the neighborhoods of Boston in
2009 and 2010. The three most expensive neighborhoods for condominiums (median price greater than
$540,000) were the Central (comprising Downtown, the North End, the West End, and the Waterfront), the
Back Bay/Beacon Hill and the South End neighborhoods, which all together form the core residential
pockets closest to downtown. Four neighborhoods had moderately priced condominiums (median price
between $345,000 and $420,500): Charlestown, South Boston, Jamaica Plain and Fenway/Kenmore. Eight
neighborhoods still had lower condominium median prices (with medians of $272,000 or below):
Allston/Brighton, Dorchester, East Boston, Hyde Park, Mattapan, Roslindale, Roxbury, and West Roxbury.
The median citywide condominium price as of calendar year 2010 was $360,000, up by 6% in price from
those of calendar year 2009. Sales volume declined by 1%.

City of Boston, Department of Neighborhood Development, February 2011, “Real Estate Trends, 2010.”

During the last two years, as a result of the problems nationally in housing markets due to the
prevalence of sub-prime loans and the subsequent slowdown in the economy, the issue of foreclosures has
become noteworthy and relevant to the discussion of housing markets. Boston has experienced an increase
in the amount of foreclosures. , While deeds to foreclose (the first step in the foreclosure process) went up
6% from 776 to 821, the petitions to foreclose (the final step in the foreclosure process) went down by 30%
from 2,200 to 1,541. Neighborhoods with the most foreclosure problems (more than 100 foreclosure
petitions in 2010) were in order from most to least: Dorchester, Roxbury, Hyde Park Mattapan, East Boston
and Roslindale. For the year 2010, foreclosure deeds are up from 2009 by 6.1%. However, foreclosure
deeds in Boston in the 4th quarter of 2010 were at the lowest level in three years. By comparison, statewide
foreclosure deeds as reported by the Warren Group were up 32% from 2009 to 2010.
Housing construction accelerated between 2000 and 2009 with the Leading the Way (LTW) I, II and
III housing strategy plans – Boston’s comprehensive strategy for intensive housing construction. The City
counted 19,145 housing units completed from 2000 through 2008 including more than 5,270 new
“affordable rate” units. When completed Boston’s Leading the Way production will total 21,024 housing
units added. A total of 9,172 net housing units were protected from “expiring use restrictions” through City
efforts to prevent their subsidized apartments from becoming market-rate. In addition, Boston Housing
Authority has preserved 5,006 formerly vacant housing units and the City has reclaimed another 2,921
vacant units to create new housing, particularly for the homeless.
The Boston Housing Authority (“BHA”) is a public agency that provides subsidized housing to low23

and moderate-income individuals and families. The Authority administers two distinct housing programs.
First, the Authority manages conventional public housing within the City of Boston. The Authority owns
60 developments, a few of which have both state and federal components and has also participated in the
mixed-finance redevelopment of five of its developments. The BHA owns and manages some scattered site
properties throughout the City of Boston as well. Of the 60 developments, 36 are designated as
elderly/disabled developments and 24 are designated as family developments. Two of the 24 family
developments have elderly/disabled housing on site and one of the elderly developments has designated
units for families. The BHA currently owns and/or oversees approximately 14,000 units of housing in
Boston and houses about 27,000 people under the public housing program. In addition, the Authority
administers approximately 12,500 tenant-based rental assistance vouchers that allow families to rent in the
private market and apply a subsidy to their rent. The BHA also subsidizes about 1,330 additional
apartments through the Section 8 Project Based Voucher and Moderate Rehabilitation programs. Through
this assistance, residents are able to pay approximately 30-40 percent of their income toward rent and the
BHA pays the remainder. The BHA helps provide housing to approximately 25,000 people under this
program.
The BHA between 1997 and 2008 completed major revitalization initiatives at four public housing
developments: Mission Main, in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston; Orchard Gardens, in Roxbury;
West Broadway in South Boston; and Maverick Gardens in East Boston. The BHA was able to initiate the
revitalization of three of these developments when it was awarded HOPE VI grants from the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”). The grants, totaling $115 million, were used to
implement a new approach to public housing financing, incorporating innovative partnerships with public
and private entities that leveraged additional development funds. The initiatives not only revitalized the
BHA sites, but the surrounding neighborhoods as well. West Broadway, a state funded public housing
development, was redeveloped through the use of a public/private partnership that included state and city
funding. In addition, the BHA completed redevelopment of the Franklin Hill public housing development
in 2009 through a fifth public private partnership and is redeveloping the Washington Beech housing
development in Roslindale under a partnership that includes HOPE VI and federal stimulus funding.
Additional federal stimulus funding recently awarded to the BHA will allow a phase one redevelopment
effort at the Old Colony development in South Boston as well as some building renovations at both the
Cathedral development in the South End and the Heath Street development in Jamaica Plain. BHA has
recently begun an energy performance contract project that will bring about $63 million in energy
efficient/infrastructure improvements to 13 BHA developments throughout the city.
The BHA is on track to exceed its 5,000-unit construction starts target for the 4-year period (calendar
year 2009 through calendar year 2012) by almost 1,800 units due in large part to the availability of Federal
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act “ARRA” funds. In the first two years of that span through 2010,
the BHA completed construction on 1,194 units, and over the next two years through year 2012 it will seek
to complete construction on another 3,806 units, bringing its total construction completions to 5,000 units
over four years. A supplementary goal for the BHA has been established for the completion of these
projects. The largest BHA project to complete construction in 2010 was the first phase of the
redevelopment of the Washington Beech development in Roslindale. This 100-unit $42.7 million
redevelopment is now being followed up by the 106-unit Phase II, which is currently under construction
and planned for completion in mid 2012.
The Linkage Program
The City implemented its development linkage program in 1983 in order to direct some of the
benefits of downtown investment to the building of affordable housing in its neighborhoods through the
Neighborhood Housing Trust (NHT). The linkage program also funds job training for City residents
through the Neighborhood Jobs Trust (NJT). Under the linkage program, which was amended in 1986 and
again in 2001, real estate developers seeking approval of large scale commercial or institutional
developments are required to enter into agreements obligating them to pay exactions in the amount of $9.44
per square-foot of construction over 100,000 square feet, of which $1.57 per square-foot goes to the job
training fund and $7.87 per square-foot goes for affordable housing purposes. The fee was last adjusted as
of March 9, 2006.
Linkage payments to the NHT are amortized over a period of either seven or twelve years, depending
on the date of the initial agreement. Under NHT policy, current agreements provide for a seven-year
payment period. The seven-member NHT board holds public hearings and has the authority to approve
linkage grants to selected projects, except for a separate “housing creation” option, which requires the
24

additional approval by the BRA. Since the inception of the linkage program through December 2010, the
NHT has awarded $128.3 million in grant funds to various affordable housing projects.
Based on data through 2010, NHT funding contributed to the complete or pending construction or
renovation of 10,252 housing units in 177 projects in the City’s neighborhoods. Affordable housing units
for low and moderate-income residents comprise 83% (8,549 units) of this total. Of these 177 housing
developments created, linkage funds, for the most part, account for fewer than 6% of the total development
costs of the projects. NHT grant awards are allocated to fund low and moderate-income housing through
the renovation of old buildings and schools, as well as to assist in the creation of new housing. Projects
have included rental units; single room occupancy units, such as housing for pregnant, homeless women
and alcohol recovery programs; condominiums; housing cooperatives; and home ownership.
Between fiscal years 1988 and 2010 over $25 million of funds were committed to the job training
component of the City’s linkage program and over $22 million of funds had been awarded to a broad range
of community-based job training and adult education programs. Services funded under this program
include: model program designs for entry-level job training, adult education, English for Speakers of Other
Languages, and transitional employment-. The NJT is particularly interested in supporting innovative
education and training activities which result in high-wage employment, new or non-traditional
employment opportunities, and community-based projects that respond to specific neighborhoods’
documented education and training needs. The NJT is committed to providing appropriate services to the
residents of neighborhoods where, or adjacent to where, a given development project is located, while also
ensuring that residents throughout the City have access to new jobs resulting from development.

Re: City of Boston, Massachusetts
General Obligation Bonds, 2011 Series __
We have acted as Bond Counsel to the City of Boston, Massachusetts (the “City”), in connection
with the issuance by the City of $___________ General Obligation Bonds, 2011 Series __ (the
“Bonds”), dated the date hereof. In such capacity, we have examined the law and such certified
proceedings and other papers as we have deemed necessary to render this opinion.
As to questions of fact material to our opinion we have relied upon representations and
covenants of the City contained in the certified proceedings and other certifications of public
officials furnished to us, without undertaking to verify the same by independent investigation.
Based on this examination, we are of the opinion, under existing law, as follows:
(1)
The Bonds are valid and binding general obligations of the City and, except to the
extent they are paid from other sources, the principal of and interest on the Bonds are payable
from taxes which may be levied without limitation as to rate or amount upon all taxable property
in the City.
(2)
Interest on the Bonds is excluded from the gross income of the owners of the
Bonds for federal income tax purposes. In addition, interest on the Bonds is not a specific
preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes.
However, such interest is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate
alternative minimum taxable income. In rendering the opinions set forth in this paragraph, we
have assumed compliance by the City with all requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 that must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that interest thereon
be, and continue to be, excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The City
has covenanted to comply with all such requirements. Failure by the City to comply with certain
of such requirements may cause the interest on the Bonds to become included in gross income
for federal income tax purposes retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds. We express no
opinion regarding any other federal tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds.
B-1

(3)
The interest on the Bonds is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes
and the Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property taxes. We express no opinion
regarding any other Massachusetts tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds or any tax
consequences arising with respect to the Bonds under the laws of any state other than
Massachusetts.
This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we neither assume nor undertake any
obligation to update, revise, supplement or restate this opinion to reflect any action taken or
omitted, or any facts or circumstances or changes in law or in the interpretation thereof, that may
hereafter arise or occur, or for any other reason.
The rights of the holders of the Bonds and the enforceability of the Bonds may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’
rights heretofore or hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable, and their
enforcement may also be subject to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases.

proceedings and other papers as we have deemed necessary to render this opinion.
The Bonds have been designated by the City as “Qualified School Construction Bonds” within
the meaning of Section 54F of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In
addition, the City has elected to designate the Bonds as “Specified Tax Credit Bonds” within the
meaning of Section 6431(f) of the Code. As a result of such election, the Bonds will bear
interest at the rates provided therein and will not provide a tax credit to the owners thereof.
As to questions of fact material to our opinion we have relied upon representations and
covenants of the City contained in the certified proceedings and other certifications of public
officials furnished to us, without undertaking to verify the same by independent investigation.
Based on our examination, we are of the opinion, under existing law, as follows:
(1)
The Bonds are valid and binding general obligations of the City and, except to the
extent they are paid from other sources, the principal of and interest on the Bonds are payable
from taxes which may be levied without limitation as to rate or amount upon all taxable property
in the City.

(2)
Interest on the Bonds is included in the gross income of the owners of the Bonds
for federal income tax purposes. We express no opinion regarding any other federal tax
consequences arising with respect to the Bonds.

The interest on the Bonds is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes
and the Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property taxes. We express no opinion
regarding any other Massachusetts tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds or any tax
consequences arising with respect to the Bonds under the laws of any state other than
Massachusetts.
This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we neither assume nor undertake any
obligation to update, revise, supplement or restate this opinion to reflect any action taken or
omitted, or any facts or circumstances or changes in law or in the interpretation thereof, that may
hereafter arise or occur, or for any other reason.
The rights of the holders of the Bonds and the enforceability of the Bonds may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’
rights heretofore or hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable, and their

obligations hereunder and not for money damages in any amount.
