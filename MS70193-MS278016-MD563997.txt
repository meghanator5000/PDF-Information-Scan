In the opinion of Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge LLP, Bond Counsel, based upon an analysis of existing law and assuming, among other matters, compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for
federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference
item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes, and interest on the Series A Bonds
is not included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable income. However,
interest on the Series B Bonds is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum
taxable income. Under existing law, interest on the Bonds is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the
Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property taxes. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other
tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds. See “Tax
Exemption” herein.

OFFICIAL STATEMENT
of the
CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
relating to
$100,000,000
GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS, 2009 SERIES A
and
$8,940,000
GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS, 2009 SERIES B
This Official Statement (which includes the cover page and Appendices hereto) provides information
concerning the City of Boston, Massachusetts (the “City”), and the $100,000,000 General Obligation Bonds, 2009
Series A (the “Series A Bonds”) and the $8,940,000 General Obligation Bonds, 2009 Series B (the “Series B
Bonds,” and, together with the Series A Bonds, the “Bonds”), to be issued by the City as described herein. Certain
credit factors concerning the Bonds are described throughout this Official Statement, which should be read in its
entirety. This Official Statement speaks only as of its date and the information contained herein is subject to change
after this date.
THE CITY
The City of Boston, incorporated as a town in 1630 and as a city in 1822, is the largest city in Massachusetts
and the capital of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Commonwealth”). The City and its component
governmental units are responsible for the provision of a wide range of government services, including education,
public safety, public health, urban planning and development and the maintenance of the City’s infrastructure, and
for funding certain employee benefits, state authority assessments and debt service requirements. Its primary sources
of revenue are property taxes, state aid and certain excises. Management of the City’s finances includes preparation
of annual operating and capital budgets, the exercise of expenditure controls and cash management. For a full
discussion concerning the City and its finances, see “Appendix A—Information Statement of the City of Boston.”
As the economic hub of New England, Boston is a center for professional, financial, higher educational and
medical services, and the focus of tourist and convention travel in New England. For a description of certain
demographic and economic information about the City, see “Appendix A—Exhibit III— City of Boston—Selected
Demographic and Economic Information.”
AUTHORIZATIONS AND PURPOSES
The Series A Bonds will be issued under various statutory authorizations and loan orders of the City Council
to finance various capital projects of the City, all as more fully described in “Appendix B—Authorizations and
Purposes.” The proceeds of the Series B Bonds will be used for the purpose of refunding certain outstanding general
obligation bonds of the City more fully described under “Plan of Refunding,” below.
SECURITY FOR THE BONDS
The Bonds will be valid general obligations of the City, for the payment of the principal of and interest on
which the full faith and credit of the City will be pledged. To the extent not paid from other legally available
revenues of the City, the Bonds are payable from ad valorem taxes which may be levied upon all taxable property in
the City without limit as to rate or amount.
Chapter 643 of the Acts of 1983 of the Commonwealth, as amended (the “Bond Procedure Act of 1983”),
requires that the debt and interest charges on all general obligation indebtedness of the City (including the Bonds), if
not otherwise provided for, be included in the City’s annual tax levy. The Bond Procedure Act of 1983 also
mandates assessment of taxes in excess of the levy limits imposed by the statewide property tax limit (“Proposition
2½”) to the extent that the debt service on City obligations is not otherwise provided for in the tax levy or from other
sources, with no allowance made for any other expenditures of the City. See “City Revenues—Property Taxes—
Proposition 2½” in “Appendix A – Information Statement of the City of Boston.” Holders of City obligations do
not have a statutory priority with respect to or a security interest in the portion of the tax levy attributable to such
obligations. See “City Indebtedness—Classification of City Debt” in “Appendix A – Information Statement of the
City of Boston.”

1

In the opinion of Bond Counsel, the City is subject to suit on the Bonds, and courts of competent jurisdiction
have power in appropriate proceedings to order payment of a judgment on the Bonds from available funds or, in the
absence of available funds, to order the inclusion of the required amount in the next annual tax levy. In exercising
their discretion as to whether to enter such an order, the courts could take into account all relevant factors, including
the current operating needs of the City and the availability and adequacy of other remedies. The Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court has stated in the past that a judgment against a municipality can be enforced by the taking
and sale of property of any inhabitant. There has been no judicial determination, however, as to whether the remedy
is constitutional under current due process and equal protection standards.
Payment of the principal and interest on the Bonds is not secured by or limited to a pledge of any particular
revenue source of the City. Chapter 190 of the Acts of 1982 of the Commonwealth (the “1982 Funding Loan Act”)
and the Bond Procedure Act of 1983 authorize the City to pledge to the payment of any of its general obligation
notes or bonds all or any part of the revenues of the City derived from any tax, fee, distribution or reimbursement
payable to the City (except distributions and reimbursements required by law to be specifically used for statutorily
defined purposes), including state aid distributions and the proceeds of the City’s annual property tax levy. No
obligations are currently outstanding which are secured by such a pledge. The Bond Procedure Act of 1983 also
authorizes the City to issue special obligation bonds payable solely from the revenues of a revenue-producing
facility, and Chapter 152 of the Acts of 1997, as amended (the “Convention Center Act”), authorizes the City to
pledge certain excise receipts and other revenues of the City to the payment of bonds of the City issued under the
authority of the Convention Center Act. The only special obligation indebtedness of the City outstanding as of
March 1, 2009 was $100.5 million of the City’s Convention Center Loan, Act of 1997, Special Obligation Bonds,
Series A, and $87.8 million of the City’s Special Obligation Refunding Bonds, Boston City Hospital Issue. See
“City Indebtedness—Special Obligation Debt” in “Appendix A – Information Statement of the City of Boston.” To
the extent required for the payment of any such secured indebtedness, the revenues pledged to their payment would
not be available to pay the Bonds.
Except to the extent specifically pledged to the payment of certain indebtedness, state aid distributions to the
City are generally available for the payment of bonds or notes of the City, but, under certain circumstances, they
may be unavailable to the extent such distributions are applied to the payment of “qualified bonds” issued by the
City (none of which bonds have been issued), or to the extent that such distributions may be applied under state law
to the satisfaction of unpaid assessments due the Commonwealth from the City for debt issued by the Massachusetts
Bay Transportation Authority, or for obligations of the City or of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission issued to
the Massachusetts Water Pollution Abatement Trust. See “City Indebtedness—Classification of City Debt” in
“Appendix A – Information Statement of the City of Boston.”
State statutes also provide that certain parking meter receipts may be used only for parking and related
purposes and, accordingly, monies derived from this source may be unavailable to pay general obligation bonds and
notes issued for other purposes. In addition, subject to certain limits, the City may annually authorize the establishment
of one or more revolving funds in connection with the use of certain revenues for programs that produce those revenues.
If it accepts certain statutory provisions, the City may also establish enterprise funds for certain purposes, including for a
health care, solid waste, recreational or transportation facility, and for police or fire services. Under those provisions any
surplus in the fund is restricted to use for capital expenditures or reduction of user charges. The City has not established
any such revolving funds or enterprise funds.
Section 19A of Chapter 44 of the General Laws provides, in part, that if the City is or is likely to be unable to
pay principal of or interest on any of its bonds or notes when due, it shall notify the state Commissioner of Revenue.
The Commissioner shall certify such inability to the State Treasurer. The State Treasurer shall pay the due or
overdue amount by the later of three days after the certification or one business day prior to the due date. This
payment is limited, however, to the estimated amounts distributable by the Commonwealth to the City during the
remainder of the fiscal year. If, for any reason, any portion of the certified sum has not been paid at the end of the
fiscal year, the State Treasurer shall pay it as soon as practicable in the next fiscal year to the extent of the estimated
distributions for such fiscal year. The sums so paid shall be charged with interest and administrative costs against the
distributions to the City. The foregoing provisions are not a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth. The
Commonwealth has not agreed to maintain existing levels of state distributions and the law requiring the
Commonwealth to use estimated distributions to pay debt service may be subject to repeal by future legislation.
Moreover, adoption of the state’s annual appropriation act is often delayed beyond the beginning of the fiscal year,
and estimated distributions which are subject to appropriation may be unavailable to pay local debt service until they
are appropriated.

2

The rights of the holders of the Bonds and the enforceability of payment of the Bonds may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights heretofore or
hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable and their enforcement may also be subject to the exercise
of judicial discretion in appropriate cases. Massachusetts municipalities are not currently authorized by the
Massachusetts General Laws to file a petition for bankruptcy under Federal Bankruptcy laws.
THE BONDS
Description
The Bonds will be dated the date of delivery and will mature on April 1 of the years, and in the amounts, and
will bear interest calculated on the basis of 30-day months and a 360-day year at the rates, shown on page iii of this
Official Statement. Interest on the Bonds will be payable on October 1, 2009 and semiannually thereafter on each
April 1 and October 1, provided that if such day is not a business day, interest will be payable on the next business
day.
The Bonds will be issued by means of a book-entry system, with bond certificates immobilized at The
Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). Bond certificates will not be available for distribution
to the public and will evidence ownership of the Bonds in principal amounts of $5,000 or integral multiples thereof,
with transfers of ownership effected on the records of DTC and its participants pursuant to rules and procedures
established by DTC and its participants. Interest on the Bonds will be paid on the interest payment dates or upon
redemption, and principal of the Bonds will be paid at maturity or upon redemption, to DTC or its nominee as
registered owner of the Bonds. Transfer of principal or redemption price and interest payments to participants of
DTC will be the responsibility of DTC; transfer of principal or redemption price and interest payments to beneficial
owners by participants of DTC will be the responsibility of such participants and other nominees of beneficial
owners. The record date for principal or redemption price and interest payments will be the fifteenth day of the
month next preceding a debt service payment date or, if such day is not a business day, the next succeeding business
day. The City will not be responsible or liable for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records maintained by
DTC, its participants or persons acting through such participants.
U.S. Bank National Association, Boston, Massachusetts, will act as paying agent for the Bonds (the “Paying
Agent”).
Redemption Prior To Maturity
Optional Redemption
The Series A Bonds maturing on or before April 1, 2019 will not be subject to redemption prior to maturity.
The Series A Bonds maturing on and after April 1, 2020 will be subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option
of the City, on or after April 1, 2019, as a whole or in part at any time, in such order of maturity as the City may
determine and by lot within each maturity as selected by DTC and its participants, at a redemption price equal to the
principal amount of the Series A Bonds to be redeemed, plus accrued interest to the redemption date. The Series B
Bonds are not subject to optional redemption prior to their stated date of maturity.
Notice of Redemption
Notice of redemption of the Bonds, specifying the numbers and maturities of the Bonds or portions thereof to
be redeemed and the redemption date, will be given not less than 30 days prior to the redemption date by notice
mailed to DTC or its nominee, as registered owner of the Bonds. The City will not be responsible for mailing notices
of redemption to anyone other than DTC or its nominee. Notice having been given, the Bonds or portions thereof
called for redemption will become due and payable on the designated redemption date. If on the redemption date
monies are available for the redemption of the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, together with interest
accrued to the redemption date, then interest on such Bonds or portions thereof shall thereafter cease to accrue.
Book-Entry Transfer System
DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds. The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities
registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an
authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of each
series of the Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of that maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.
DTC, the world’s largest depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York
Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the

3

Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code,
and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and
municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct
Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales
and other securities transactions, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and
pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC, is the holding company for DTC, National, and
Securities Clearing Corporation, and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing
agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated securities. Access to the DTC system is also available to
others as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly
(“Indirect Participants”). DTC has Standard & Poor’s highest rating: AAA. The DTC Rules applicable to its
Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at
www.dtcc.com and www.dtc.org.
Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive
a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial
Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive
written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written
confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or
Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership
interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting
on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership
interests in the Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.
To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the
name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an authorized
representative of DTC. The deposit of the Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such
other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual
Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts
such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will
remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.
Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to
Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by
arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.
Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within a maturity of a series are being
redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such
maturity to be redeemed.
Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the Bonds
unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI procedures. Under its usual procedures,
DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the City as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede
& Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Bonds are credited on the
record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).
Principal or redemption price and interest payments on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or such other
nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct
Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the City or the
Paying Agent on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments
by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the
case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the
responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC or, its nominee, the Paying Agent, or the City, subject to any
statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal or redemption price
and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is
the responsibility of the City or the Paying Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants shall be the

4

responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners shall be the responsibility of
Direct and Indirect Participants.
DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by
giving reasonable notice to the City or the Paying Agent. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor
securities depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered to DTC.
The City may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a
successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certificates will be printed and delivered.
The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from
sources that the City believes to be reliable, but the City takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

LITIGATION
No litigation is pending or, to the knowledge of the City’s Corporation Counsel, threatened (a) seeking to
restrain or enjoin the issuance or delivery of the Bonds, (b) contesting or affecting any authority for or the validity of
the Bonds, (c) contesting the power of the City to issue the Bonds or the power of the City to offer and sell the
Bonds to the Underwriter, (d) contesting the power of the City to levy and collect taxes to pay the Bonds (e)
contesting the corporate existence or boundaries of the City, or (f) contesting the title of officials of the City who
have acted with respect to the proceedings for the issuance and sale of the Bonds to their respective offices.
There are pending in courts within the Commonwealth various suits in which the City is a defendant. No
litigation is pending or threatened which is likely to result, either individually or in the aggregate, in final judgments
against the City which would affect materially its ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds when due
or which would affect materially its financial condition.
TAX EXEMPTION
In the opinion of Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge LLP, Bond Counsel to the City (“Bond Counsel”), based
upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings, and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters,
compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax
purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”). Bond Counsel is of the further
opinion that interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate
alternative minimum taxes, and that interest on the Series A Bonds is not included in adjusted current earnings when
calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable income. However, interest on the Series B Bonds is included in
the adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable income. The foregoing
opinions reflect the enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 which includes provisions
that modify the treatment under the alternative minimum tax of interest on certain bonds of state and local government
entities. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other federal tax consequences arising with respect to the
ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds.
The Code imposes various requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax
purposes of interest on obligations such as the Bonds. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in
interest on the Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of
original issuance of the Bonds. The City has covenanted to comply with such requirements to ensure that interest on
the Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes compliance with
these requirements.
Bond Counsel is also of the opinion that, under existing law, interest on the Bonds is exempt from
Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property taxes. Bond
Counsel has not opined as to other Massachusetts tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds. Prospective
Bondholders should be aware, however, that the Bonds are included in the measure of Massachusetts estate and
inheritance taxes, and the Bonds and the interest thereon are included in the measure of certain Massachusetts
corporate excise and franchise taxes. Bond Counsel has not opined as to the taxability of the Bonds or the income
therefrom under the laws of any state other than Massachusetts.
A complete copy of the proposed form of the opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in Appendix C hereto.
To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at maturity of such
Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the term of such Bonds), the
difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the accrual of which, to the extent properly allocable to each owner
thereof, is treated as interest on the Bonds which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and
is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes. For this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of the
Bonds is the first price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of the Bonds is sold to the public (excluding
bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers). The original issue discount with respect to any maturity of the Bonds accrues daily over the term to
maturity of such Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded semiannually (with straight-line
interpolations between compounding dates). The accruing original issue discount is added to the adjusted basis of
such Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment on maturity)
of such Bonds. Bondholders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of
ownership of Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of purchasers who do not purchase such
Bonds in the original offering to the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such Bonds is sold to
the public.

7

Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount greater than the stated principal
amount to be paid at maturity of such Bonds, or, in some cases, at the earlier redemption date of such Bonds
("Premium Bonds"), will be treated as having amortizable bond premium for federal income tax purposes and
Massachusetts personal income tax purposes. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the
case of obligations, such as the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes. However, a Bondholder’s basis in a Premium Bond will be reduced by the amount of
amortizable bond premium properly allocable to such Bondholder. Holders of Premium Bonds should consult their
own tax advisors with respect to the proper treatment of amortizable bond premium in their particular circumstances.
Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not
taken) or events occurring (or not occurring) after the date of issuance of the Bonds may adversely affect the value
of, or the tax status of interest on, the Bonds. Further, no assurance can be given that pending or future legislation,
including amendments to the Code, if enacted into law, or any proposed legislation, including amendments to the
Code, or any future judicial, regulatory or administrative interpretation or development with respect to existing law,
will not adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the Bonds. Prospective Bondholders are urged
to consult their own tax advisors with respect to proposals to restructure the federal income tax.
Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes and is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or
the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds may otherwise affect the federal or state tax liability of a Bondholder.
Among other possible consequences of ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the
Bonds, the Code requires recipients of certain social security and certain railroad retirement benefits to take into
account receipts or accruals of interest on the Bonds in determining the portion of such benefits that are included in
gross income. The nature and extent of all such other tax consequences will depend upon the particular tax status of
the Bondholder or the Bondholder’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion
regarding any such other tax consequences and Bondholders should consult with their own tax advisors with respect
to such consequences.
CREDIT RATINGS
Moody’s Investors Service Inc., (“Moody’s”), 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York,
New York, and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, a division of the McGraw-Hill companies (“Standard &
Poor’s”), 55 Water Street, New York, New York, have assigned the ratings of “Aa1,” and “AA+,” respectively, to
the Bonds, reflecting the City’s capacity to pay debt service. Such ratings reflect only the views of such
organizations and any desired explanation of the significance of such ratings should be obtained from the rating
agency furnishing the same. Generally, a rating agency bases its rating on the information and materials furnished to
it and on investigations, studies and assumptions of it own. There is no assurance that any such ratings will continue
for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely by the rating
agency concerned, if in the judgment of such rating agency, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision
or withdrawal of any such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Bonds.
COMPETITIVE SALE OF BONDS
The Bonds were offered for sale by the City on March 5, 2009, in accordance with the Official Notice of Sale
dated February 26, 2009 (the “Official Notice of Sale”).
Barclays Capital, Inc. (“Barclays”) was the successful bidder for the Series A Bonds. Information provided by
Barclays regarding the interest rates and reoffering yields of the Series A Bonds is set forth on page iii of this
Official Statement. The Series A Bonds are being purchased from the City by Barclays at an aggregate price of
$104,992,550.90, reflecting the principal amount of $100,000,000.00, plus net original issue premium of
$5,855,550.90, less underwriters discount of $863,000.00.
UBS Financial Services Inc. (“UBS”) was the successful bidder for the Series B Bonds. Information provided
by UBS regarding the interest rates and reoffering yields of the Series B Bonds is set forth on page iii of this Official
Statement. The Series B Bonds are being purchased from the City by UBS at an aggregate price of $9,311,286.95,
reflecting the principal amount of $8,940,000.00, plus net original issue premium of $464,709.95, less underwriters
discount of $93,423.00.
Barclays and UBS, and any of their respective associates underwriting the Bonds, may offer to sell the Bonds
to certain dealers and others at prices other than the initial public offering prices, and the public offering prices may
be changed from time to time by the underwriters.

All legal matters incidental to the authorization and issuance of the Bonds are subject to the approval of
Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge LLP, Boston, Massachusetts, Bond Counsel to the City. Reference should be
made to the form of opinion set forth in Appendix C for the matters to be covered therein. In addition, Corporation

to assume responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness, or fairness of the information contained in this Official
Statement. PFM is an independent financial advisory firm and is not engaged in the business of underwriting,
trading, or distributing securities or other public securities.
CONTINUING DISCLOSURE
In order to assist the underwriter in complying with Rule 15c2-12 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “Rule”), the City will covenant for the benefit of owners of the Bonds to provide certain financial
information and operating data relating to the City by not later than 365 days after the end of each fiscal year (the
“Annual Report”), and to provide notices of occurrence of certain enumerated events, if material. The covenants will
be contained in a Continuing Disclosure Certificate, the proposed form of which is provided in Appendix D (the
“Certificate”). The Certificate will be executed on the delivery date of the Bonds and incorporated by reference in
the Bonds. The City has executed previous undertakings to provide annual reports or notices of material events in
accordance with the Rule and has never failed to comply in all material respects with any such undertaking, except
that, due to an administrative oversight, the annual reports required to be filed for fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004
were not filed within the time periods required under certain of such undertakings. The City has since filed a report
to comply with such continuing disclosure undertakings, and it has implemented procedures to ensure timely filing
of all future annual reports and notices of material events required thereunder.
In order to assist the City in carrying out its obligations under the Certificate and under its other continuing
disclosure undertakings, the City has entered into an agreement with Digital Assurance Certification, L.L.C.

filings required to satisfy such obligations.

THE CITY
The City, incorporated as a town in 1630 and as a city in 1822, exists under Chapter 486 of the Acts of 1909

The Mayor is the chief executive officer of the City. Thomas M. Menino, the Mayor of the City, was reelected
to serve a fourth four-year term from January 2006 through January 2010. The Mayor has general supervision of and

appropriations for all departments and operations of the City, except the School Department, the Boston Public
Health Commission, and the Office of the Sheriff of Suffolk County, is prepared under the direction of the Mayor.
Prior to his first elected term, Mayor Menino had served for approximately four months as acting Mayor. Prior to his
service as acting Mayor, the Mayor served on the City Council. He served as Chairman of the City Council’s Ways

The legislative body of the City is the thirteen-member City Council. The City Council enacts ordinances and
adopts orders, which the Mayor may either approve or veto. Ordinances and orders, except for orders for the
borrowing or appropriation of money and the reorganization of City departments, may be enacted by the City

A description of certain City principal governmental services follows:
Schools
The City’s School Department provides both basic education and college preparatory curricula as
well as specialized vocational educational programs. The school system enrolled 56,524 students for the
2007-2008 school year, a decrease of approximately 239 students from the preceding school year.
Pursuant to Chapter 108 of the Acts of 1992, the City’s public schools are under the control of a
School Committee, which consists of seven members appointed by the Mayor. Members of the School
Committee have staggered four-year terms. In addition to appointing the Superintendent of Schools, the
Boston School Committee approves the School Department budget for submission to the Mayor, and by
and through the Superintendent, determines educational policy, makes all contracts for the purchase of
materials for the operations of the schools, and maintains and operates school properties. The
Superintendent of Schools has exclusive authority to make appointments and promotions for all teachers
and other School Department personnel except for the positions of Community Superintendent, Chairman,
Secretary, or Treasurer of the School Committee, School Committee Administrative Assistants, and Special
Assistant Corporation Counsels. The School Committee appoints these excepted positions.
Public Safety
The Public Safety Cabinet is continuing to improve citywide service-delivery through consolidated
and shared resources to provide more effective and efficient public safety services to Boston’s
communities.
The Police Department maintains eleven neighborhood police stations and one headquarters building.
It also maintains ten support programs, consisting of the Police Academy, Horse Stables, Firearms Training
A-6

Range, Harbor Patrol Unit, Fleet Management Unit, Telecommunications Unit, Evidence and Property
Management Facility, Special Operations Division, Stress Support Unit and Sexual Assault Unit.
The Fire Department maintains 40 facilities consisting of 34 neighborhood fire stations, one marine
unit, a training academy, a fire prevention division, a fire alarm division, headquarters/maintenance
division/fire investigation building, and a high-pressure pumping station. In 2008, the Fire Department
completed construction of a $3.8 million training simulator and restarted its “back-to-basics” training at the
Fire Training Academy. The Fire Department also purchased five new ladder trucks and three new fire
engines at a cost of $4.1 million.
The Mayor’s Office of Emergency Preparedness coordinates and directs Boston’s interdepartmental
and multi-jurisdictional homeland security activities by advising the Mayor on issues and obtaining and
managing outside funding. See “Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness,” above.
Public Health
The Boston Public Health Commission, successor to the City’s Department of Health and Hospitals,
is a body politic and corporate separate from the City created in 1996 when the operations of the City’s
former acute-care hospital, Boston City Hospital, were consolidated with the operations of Boston
University Medical Center Hospital under the control of the Boston Medical Center Corporation
(“BMCC”), a private, Massachusetts non-profit corporation. The Commission is governed by a sevenmember board, six of whom are appointed by the Mayor, subject to confirmation by the City Council, and
one of whom, as the chief executive officer of BMCC, serves ex-officio. The Commission functions as the
City’s board of health and operates a wide range of public health programs throughout the City funded
from public and private grants and City appropriations. The Commission is a discretely presented
component unit for GAAP reporting purposes in the City’s annual audited financial statements. See “City
Indebtedness–Debt of Agencies Related to the City–Boston Public Health Commission.”
Public Works
The Public Works Department constructs and maintains highways, sidewalks, street lighting and
bridges, and oversees snow removal, street cleaning, refuse removal and recycling. The City advertised,
awarded, and executed five contracts for the provision of sanitation, solid waste collection and disposal
services, including recycling, for a four-year term beginning July 1, 2005 and ending June 30, 2009. The
cost of these services equaled approximately $41.1 million in fiscal 2008. The estimated cost of these
contracts in fiscal 2009 equals approximately $43.6 million. The Boston Water and Sewer Commission
(“BWSC”), an independent agency, is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the City’s water,
and sewer, and storm water drainage systems, the construction of improvements to those systems, and the
collection of user charges for its services. See “City Indebtedness—Debt of Agencies Related to the City—
Boston Water and Sewer Commission” below.
Other Services
The Boston Public Library Department operates a central library, 26 neighborhood branch libraries, a
downtown business library, and two service buildings. The Parks and Recreation Department manages
approximately 2,200 acres of active, passive and historic parkland. The 2,200 acres of land include 272
parks, playgrounds, squares, malls, plazas, and other miscellaneous sites; sixteen historic and three active
cemeteries; one greenhouse facility; and approximately 38,000 street trees.
Office of the Suffolk County Sheriff
While existing state law provides that the Mayor and City Council serve as the Commissioners of
Suffolk County, which includes the Cities of Boston, Chelsea and Revere and the Town of Winthrop, all of
the functions and costs of county government, including the county courts and registry of deeds, have been
assumed by the Commonwealth, other than the operations of the Office of the Suffolk County Sheriff. The
Suffolk County Sheriff is an elected position under state law who administers the county jail and houses of
correction independent of the City. Legislation is currently pending in the state legislature to abolish the
government of Suffolk County.
Under legislation enacted in 1985 and 1991, the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for all of the
capital costs of the county jail and houses of correction. Currently, the operating budget for the Office of
the Suffolk County Sheriff is prepared under the supervision of the Sheriff, without submission to or
approval by the Mayor or the City Council, but subject to approval by the Commonwealth’s County
Government Finance Review Board, consisting of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, the
Commissioner of Revenue and the Secretary of Public Safety. Since 1992, the Commonwealth has also
assumed responsibility for varying percentages (96% in fiscal 2009) of the state-approved operating budget
A-7

for the Sheriff’s Office. The City’s fiscal 2009 budget includes an appropriation for the remaining 4% of
the state-approved budget.

Employee Relations
Under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 150E, most municipal employees in the Commonwealth
enjoy the right to join labor unions and bargain collectively over wages and other terms and conditions of
employment. The Office of Labor Relations represents the Mayor and the City in all collective bargaining
matters with all unions of City employees except School Department employee unions. The School
Department’s labor relations personnel similarly represent the School Committee and consult with the
Office of Labor Relations regarding contract negotiations and other general labor matters. Additionally, the
Office of Labor Relations has actively assisted the Boston Public Health Commission in collective
bargaining negotiations with its eleven bargaining units and regularly interfaces with the Boston Public
Health Commission on labor and employment matters. The Office of Labor Relations provides no such
assistance to the Office of the Suffolk County Sheriff, which itself manages relations with its employees.
Nearly all of the City’s non-school department employees are organized into bargaining units
represented by various unions. Most of these unions are affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Three large unions,
the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (“AFSCME”) Council 93 (laborer
employees), the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) Local 285 (clerical employees), and the
Salaried Employees of North America (“SENA”) Local 9158 (middle manager employees) represent the
majority of City’s non-public safety employees.
Police officers are represented by four distinct unions, the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association
(“BPPA”), the Boston Police Superior Officers Federation (“Federation”), the Boston Police Detectives
Benevolent Society (“Detectives”) and the Boston Police Detectives Benevolent Society, Superior Officers
Unit (“Detective Superiors”). Firefighters and Fire Chiefs are divided into two bargaining units represented
by a single union: the International Association of Firefighters (“IAFF”) Local 718.
Boston teachers, teacher aides, school nurses, and substitutes are in a collective bargaining unit
represented by the Boston Teachers Union (“BTU”), an affiliate of the AFL-CIO.
The table below represents a summary of the bargaining units representing City employees, the
number of City employees represented by each bargaining unit, and the status of the City’s contract with
each bargaining unit.

Close to ninety percent of the collective bargaining agreements between the City and the unions have
been successfully re-negotiated. The new contracts will remain in effect until various dates in 2010. The
Boston Teacher's Union and the four public safety unions that have concluded negotiations agreed to
roughly a 14% wage package over a four year period. The City was able to secure meaningful language
reforms with each of these unions in exchange for this wage pattern. All of the civilian contracts that the
City has settled included roughly an 11% wage increase over a four year period. Each of the contracts that
have been settled has included a modest increase in the employee contribution to HMO premiums. Prior to
the new contract period, employees paid 10% of the cost of an HMO premium; by the end of the new
contract period the employee contribution will be 15%. The City continues to negotiate with those unions
with whom it has not completed negotiations. In the case of the firefighters union, the parties have begun
an arbitration process. The City does not anticipate any disruption in municipal services.
FINANCIAL OPERATIONS
Budget Process
Program-Based Budgeting
The City of Boston maintains a program-based budgeting system to track expenditures and service
levels by major functions or “programs.” This budgeting system complies with the standards of the
A-9

Government Finance Officers Association, which has consistently recognized the City’s efforts with its
Distinguished Budget Presentation Award.
The City’s fiscal year begins July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following calendar year. Pursuant to
state law, the Mayor must submit an operating budget to the City Council by the second Wednesday in
April for its review and approval. Proposed appropriations for all departments and operations of the City
(except for the public schools and public health services) are prepared under the direction of the Mayor in
the Office of Budget Management (“OBM”). The Superintendent of Schools must submit a budget to the
School Committee by the first Wednesday in February. The School Committee must approve a budget by
the fourth Wednesday in March and forward this budget to the Mayor who may approve or reduce the total
recommended budget. The Mayor then submits the school budget to the City Council for appropriation by
the second Wednesday in May. In practice, the School Department appropriation request has been
presented to the City Council in coordination with the Mayor’s operating budget request in April. The
Boston Public Health Commission must submit a revenue and expenditure budget for public health services
to the Mayor by the second Wednesday in March. If the proposed budget provides for expenditures in
excess of the Commission’s projected revenues from non-City sources, the Mayor may either approve or
reject the budget. If the Mayor accepts the budget, the amount required to fund the revenue deficiency (the
“net cost of public health services”) is included in the annual budget for the City submitted to the City
Council in April of each year. The Commission must adopt its public health services budget by the second
Wednesday in June.
The City Council may reduce or reject any item in the Mayor’s budget but may not, except upon the
recommendation of the Mayor, increase or add an item. After approval of the budget and until the property
tax rate is officially determined in mid-December, the Mayor may submit to the City Council such
supplementary appropriation requests as are deemed necessary, including supplemental amounts for the
School Department and the Boston Public Health Commission. The Mayor may also submit to the City
Council supplementary appropriation requests subsequent to the setting of the property tax rate. Under
certain circumstances, the Mayor may, by executive order, require expenditures to be limited to an amount
less than the appropriated level.
In the event that the City enters a fiscal year without an approved operating budget, the City
continues departmental operations on a “one-twelfth” budget, as provided in the City Charter. Under the
one-twelfth budget process, (a) payrolls for regular employees cannot exceed the average monthly
expenditure of the last three months of the preceding fiscal year, (b) total liabilities incurred in any month
cannot exceed amounts spent for similar purposes during any one month of the preceding fiscal year, and
(c) monthly expenditures for new departments cannot exceed one-twelfth of their current fiscal year’s
estimated costs.
The City, Boston Public Health Commission and School Department operating budgets for fiscal
2009 were approved by the City Council on June 25, 2008. See “Financial Operations—Fiscal 2009
Budget.” The Mayor also initiates loan orders for City Council consideration, based on an annual update of
the Five-Year Capital Plan. There is no statutory time frame for requesting or approving such orders. New
authorizations related to the fiscal 2009 portion of the Five-Year Capital Plan were submitted to the City
Council on April 9, 2008 and were approved by the City Council on June 18, 2008.
By law, the City must establish its property tax rate each year so that the resulting property tax levy
complies with the requirements of Proposition 2½. (For a discussion of Proposition 2½, see “City
Revenues—Property Taxes—Proposition 2½.”) The amount raised in the tax levy equals the sum of (a) the
aggregate of all amounts appropriated, granted or lawfully expended since the last annual tax levy and not
provided for, plus (b) all debt and interest charges on general obligation debt of the City maturing during
the fiscal year and not otherwise provided for, plus (c) all amounts necessary to satisfy final judgments,
plus (d) provision for certain prior years’ deficits, less (e) the aggregate of all non-property tax revenues
projected to be received in the City’s General Fund in amounts certified or approved by the Commonwealth
for tax rate purposes. In general, the City is required to raise in the tax levy a deficit incurred on a statutory
accounting basis in the prior year’s operating budget, or a deficit incurred in the property tax abatement
reserves.
Capital Budgeting
The Capital Budgeting Program (“CBP”), a program of OBM, is responsible for managing the capital
budget of the City. CBP’s mission is to evaluate the condition of the City’s capital assets, forecast the
timing and financial requirements of new construction and rehabilitation, and recommend allocation of
current and future resources to meet the City’s infrastructure and capital requirements. Resource
availability and capital needs are assessed frequently and appropriate planning responses are taken.
A-10

CBP evaluates and refines the relationship between the City’s capital needs and resources as the City
moves through each fiscal year. This process is documented by an annually updated five-year capital plan.
In April 2008, Mayor Menino released the fiscal 2009-2013 capital plan, incorporated with the operating
budget. In addition to its planning functions, CBP also plays an ongoing project oversight role during the
implementation phase of its capital projects. CBP reviews and approves all capital contracts and monitors
project costs and schedules to ensure the adequacy of available funding sources.
Summary and Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary Basis)—Fiscal 2005-2009
The table below shows the City’s legally adopted General Fund budget for fiscal 2009, together with
budgetary actual results for fiscal 2005 through 2008. In accordance with state law and regulations, the
City’s legally adopted General Fund budget as shown below is prepared on a “budgetary basis” instead of
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Among the key
differences between these two sets of accounting principles are that “budgetary” records property tax as it
is levied while GAAP records it as it becomes susceptible to accrual, “budgetary” records certain activities
and transactions in the General Fund that GAAP records in separate funds, and “budgetary” records as an
expenditure any amount raised to cover a prior year deficit, and as a revenue any available funds raised
from prior year surpluses, while GAAP ignores these impacts from prior years. The difference in
accounting principles inevitably leads to varying results in excess or deficiency of revenues over
expenditures.

(1) Represents the budget at the time of the approval of the tax rate on December 15, 2008 plus any supplemental appropriations or
mayoral reallocations.
(2) If the City's reserves for abatements prove at the end of the fiscal year to be insufficient to cover the City's abatement liability,
the City is required to raise in the following year's tax rate an amount sufficient to generate additional reserves to cover the
shortfall. In fiscal 2009, the City has reserved 2.5% of the net levy for abatements.
(3) Non-recurring revenue in fiscal 2008 and 2009 include a portion of the proceeds from the Surplus Property Fund ($5.7 million
and $6.0 million). Non-recurring revenue in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 include a portion of the proceeds from Budgetary Fund
Balance ($6.7 million, $7.5 million, $20.0 million, and $35 million, respectively).
(4) Excludes non-contributory pensions and annuities that are included in departmental expenditures. The amount of such noncontributory pensions and annuities equaled $4.9 million, $4.6 million, $4.6 million, $4.1 million, and $4.2 million, respectively
in fiscal 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.
(5) The debt service amount is derived from principal and interest, less certain offsetting revenues. The revenues utilized to offset
debt for budgetary and tax rate setting purposes vary from those used in the table “Debt Service Requirements-Fiscal 20042008." See "City Indebtedness-Debt Service Requirements.”

Fiscal 2005-2008 Actual Results
Between fiscal 2005 and 2008, City revenues recovered from their 2001-2002 recession-driven lows
and the property tax continued to produce steady revenue growth. State aid to the City did not return to
levels attained prior to the last recession and state aid net of municipal charges or “assessments” continued
to decline. In addition, the City continued to experience steep increases in employee health insurance and
pension costs (For discussion of aid from the Commonwealth, see “City Revenues–―State Aid”).
In spite of these cost pressures and reduced in net state aid, the City was able to maintain a balanced
budget and produce operating surpluses in each year. In addition, in fiscal 2008 the City made its first ever

A-12

contribution to a stabilization fund designated to pay for Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) of City
retirees.
Fiscal 2009 Budget
The following is a summary of the City’s fiscal 2009 budget on a budgetary accounting basis. The
figures cited are from the fiscal 2009 tax rate budget at the time of certification of both the aggregate
amount of and the rates of tax for the City’s fiscal 2009 property tax levy by the Massachusetts Department
of Revenue, plus supplemental appropriations. This certification was completed on December 15, 2008.
Expenditures
In fiscal 2009, the City’s budgeted expenditures total $2.42 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed expenses, representing an increase of $92.9 million or 4.0% from fiscal
2008 actual expenditures. Budgeted fiscal 2009 departmental expenditures compare with actual fiscal 2008
expenditures as follows: City Departments increased $9.5 million or 1.0%; the Public Health Commission
increased $1.3 million or 1.8%; and the School Department increased $37.6 million or 4.7%; Collective
Bargaining Reserve increased $5.2 million or 44.2%; and the appropriation to the OPEB Stabilization Fund
increased $5.0 million or 25.0%. Budgeted fixed expenses for fiscal 2009 compare with fiscal 2008 actual
expenses as follows: Pensions increased $10.3 million or 5.1%; Debt Service increased $10.4 million or
9.0%; State Assessments increased $14.8 million or 11.6%; and City costs for the Office of the Suffolk
County Sheriff decreased $0.2 million or 3.8%. The appropriation for the Suffolk County Sheriff is treated
as a mandatory expenditure included in Fixed Costs because it is required by, and calculated in accordance
with, state law. See “The City—Principal Government Services—Office of the Suffolk County Sheriff.”
Factors contributing to the cost increases in City Departments are salary increases scheduled for fiscal
2009 and inflationary increases in health insurance and non-personnel costs such as utilities and trash
removal. The increases in the School Department and the Public Health Commission are largely reflective
of salary and health insurance increases. The increase in pension expenses is mandated by the City’s
pension funding schedule as approved by the state actuary and is a legal obligation of the City. The City’s
current pension schedule fully funds the system by the end of fiscal 2023, five years earlier than required
by law. State Assessments are also mandatory; the amounts are determined by the Commonwealth. All but
a small portion of the increase in State Assessments is the result of the increase in the charge to the City for
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) service and for Charter School Tuition.
Revenues
Budgeted revenues for fiscal 2009 equal $2.42 billion, an increase of $77.0 million or 3.3% from
fiscal 2008 actual revenues. Selected fiscal 2009 budgeted revenues compare with fiscal 2008 actual
revenues as follows: the Gross Property Tax Levy (including new growth) increased $65.4 million or 4.9%;
Excises decreased $0.8 million or 0.8%; Interest on Investments decreased $21.0 million or 53.2%;
Licenses and Permits decreased $7.0 million or 14.7%; Available Funds from parking meter and cemetery
fees increased $2.0 million or 16.9%; State Aid increased $11.3 million or 2.3%; and Non-Recurring
Revenue increased by $15.3 million or 59.7%.
The Property Tax, the City’s largest source of revenue, has become increasingly important to the
City’s recent revenue growth given the minimal growth of the City’s second largest source of revenue:
State Aid. Property tax revenues are expected to increase $65.4 million or 4.9% in fiscal 2009 after having
increased by over $56 million and more than 5.0% in each fiscal year between 2005 and 2008. The nearterm outlook for the City’s property tax levy is one of continued stable growth.
The minor decrease in Excises, despite a substantial drop in motor vehicle excise receipts, is the
result of an expected increase in aircraft fuel excise receipts. The increase in fiscal 2009 aircraft fuel excise
receipts is due to late remittance by the Commonwealth of fourth quarter fiscal 2008 receipts, which
resulted in delivery of that payment after the commencement of fiscal 2009. Four quarterly payments of
aircraft fuel excises were budgeted for fiscal 2009. (See “City Revenues—Excise Revenues.”) The decrease
in Interest on Investment is based on action by the Federal Reserve to reduce its target federal funds rate.
The decrease in Licenses & Permits is due to expected lower building permit activity associated with a
slow real estate market. The increase in Available Funds is due to projected increased Parking Meter
receipts. The increase in State Aid is due to increases in school aid and related reimbursements.
The increase in Non-Recurring Revenue is largely due to an additional $5.0 million in Budgetary
Fund Balance for the OPEB Stabilization Fund (for a discussion of OPEB, see “Employee Benefits – Other
Post Employment Benefits”) and $10.0 million in support of the Boston Public Schools budget. In addition,
$6.0 million in Surplus Property funds will be used for operations. Budgetary Fund Balance is available for
A-13

appropriation after certification of its value by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. Fiscal 2009
becomes the fifth year of use of this reserve since fiscal 1992.
Since certification of the tax rate on December 15, 2008, the City has received notification of
emergency reductions in state aid revenue in the current fiscal year 2009. These reductions were made by
the Governor through authority granted by the Legislature. The City’s reduction, to be incurred in equal
parts over the last two quarterly state aid distributions in fiscal 2009, will total $22.9 million. The City
expects to absorb this reduction through a combination of surpluses in other revenues, appropriation
surpluses resulting from cost saving measures put in place prior to the announcement of these reductions,
and an appropriation from reserves.
Financial Statements
The City engages independent certified public accountants to audit and report on its financial
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. An
external Audit Committee, appointed by the Mayor, monitors the progress of the annual audit, reviews the
recommendations of the firm and reports the Committee’s activities and recommendations to the Mayor
and the City Council.
The City’s audited financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, (“GAAP”). The accounts of the City are organized on
the basis of funds. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a set of self-balancing accounts that
comprise its assets, liabilities, net assets/fund balance, revenues and expenditures/expenses. For a
discussion of the significant accounting policies employed in preparing the City’s fiscal 2008 audited
financial statements, see Note 2 of such audited financial statements, which are attached hereto as Exhibit I.
The City’s fiscal 2008 financial statements received an unqualified opinion.
GAAP accounting differs from the “statutory” accounting or “budgetary” accounting basis prescribed
by the Bureau of Accounts of the Commonwealth, for the annual budget and property tax certification
process. The major differences are explained in Note 4 of the fiscal 2008 audited financial statements,
attached hereto as Exhibit I.
Attached hereto as Exhibit II are Comparative Balance Sheets and Statements of Revenues,
Expenditures, Transfers and Equity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004,

audited financial statements for those fiscal years.

The following is a summary analysis of the City’s financial operations on a GAAP basis over the
period fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2008. The figures appearing in this section for the period are derived from
the annual financial statements. The analyses of revenues and expenditures in the text that follows are
stated using data derived from the audited financial statements. For an explanation of the differences
between the GAAP basis and Budgetary basis of accounting, see the audited financial statements at Exhibit
I, Note No. 4, “Budgetary Data.”
The City’s major recurring revenue sources during this period were real and personal property taxes,
state aid, payments in lieu of taxes (“PILOTs”), local excises and departmental revenues, and other
intergovernmental sources. The principal expenditures were for public safety, debt requirements, retirement
costs, and the School Department. Reference is made to Exhibits I and II attached hereto for a detailed
presentation of the City’s financial operations.
Fiscal 2006
Revenues showed slight increases in fiscal year 2006 from fiscal year 2005. The most notable
occurred in property taxes, excise taxes, payments in lieu of taxes, investment income and departmental
and other revenues. Property taxes increased $52.1 million, or 4.6%, reflecting continuing growth in the tax
base, as well as a strong real estate market. Excise taxes increased $13.4 million, or 14.3%, reflected by an
increase in the number of motor vehicles excise taxes billed. Payments in lieu of taxes increased by $18.4
million or 43.5%. This change is due to an increase in the number of miscellaneous properties added to this
revenue base and a large one-time settlement payment made in fiscal 2006 for multiple fiscal years’ back
payments. An increase in investment income ($14.4 million) was the result of still stronger market
performance and rising interest rates, yielding positive returns on the City’s cash balances. Departmental
and other revenues decreased due solely to one-time revenue received in fiscal 2005. Licenses and Permits
reported an increase in fees of $6.9 million. This is primarily due to a sizable increase in Building Permits
of $3.3 million and a change in GAAP accruals that comprised the balance of the increases in this category
as of June 30, 2006. Intergovernmental (State Aid) revenues increased by $96.5 million or 21.0%, due to
revenues received from the Massachusetts School Building Authority for three major school projects. The
overall growth in revenues represents a $195.6 million increase or 10.2% higher than fiscal 2005.
Overall, fiscal year 2006 expenditures increased over the previous year by 4.9% or $92.0 million.
The most notable increases occurred in Property and Development of $3.5 million or 11.7% over fiscal
2005 expenditures, Schools by $46.7 million or 6.9%, Judgments and Claims by $5.0 million or 75.1%, due
to a one-time large settlement of $5.0 million, which was accrued for fiscal 2006, Retirement Costs by
$37.4 million or 63.0%, Other Employee Benefits by $15.2 million or 10.6% over fiscal year 2005 costs.
These increases are attributable to an expanding retirement base and increases in premiums by the Health
Insurance providers. Solid financial controls over other expenditure categories allowed for the overall
percentage of increase in expenditures to remain moderate.
The General Fund’s equity balance as of June 30, 2006 was $661.4 million, as compared to $613.0
million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $48.4 million or 7.9% is primarily due to a continued increase in
Property and Excise Taxes. Please refer to the statements of General Fund activity in the Comparative
A-15

Balance Sheets and Statements of Revenues and Expenditures (Exhibit II to this Appendix A), and Note 2
in Notes to Basic Financial Statements (Exhibit I to this Appendix A) for a more in-depth explanation of
these entries and the manner in which they impact the Fund equity balance calculation.
Fiscal 2007
During fiscal year 2007, the City’s revenues increased by 0.4% from fiscal year 2006. The City’s
largest sources of revenues were property taxes, excise taxes, and payment in lieu of taxes totaling $1.41
billion (66.9% of total revenue). Property taxes increased $68.5 million, an increase of 5.8% from fiscal
2006. Departmental and other increased by $13.7 million, representing a 26.3% change from fiscal 2006.
The main factors were: an increase in municipal Medicaid reimbursement of $4.9 million, an increase in
fringe retirement reimbursement from grants of $4.6 million and an increase in street cut permits and fees
of $2.4 million. Investment income totaled $43.1 million, a 33.1% increase from fiscal 2006. The primary
factor for the increases in investment income was higher investment rates.
The increase in revenues allowed for an increase in expense categories. The City's expenses covered
a range of services. The largest expenses were for schools ($743.8 million), public safety ($477.4 million),
other employee benefits ($175.9 million), state and district assessments ($124.2 million), debt service
($113.2 million), public works ($97.9 million), and retirement costs ($92.9 million). Public safety realized
a $30.6 million increase. The driving force behind the increased expenses for schools and public safety
were increases in salaries. Even though public works represented a rather large expense, this category
realized a decrease primarily due to less spending on snow removal. State and district assessments realized
a nearly 5.0% increase due to increases in Charter School Sending Tuition and MBTA Assessments. Debt
service expenses increased due to increases in scheduled principal and interest payments. Retirement costs
expenses increased due to an increase in the City’s actuarially required contribution.
The General Fund’s equity balance as of June 30, 2007 was $732.0 million, as compared to $661.4
million in fiscal 2006. The increase of $70.6 million or 10.7% is primarily due to a continued increase in
Property and Excise Taxes. Please refer to the statements of General Fund activity in the Comparative
Balance Sheets and Statements of Revenues and Expenditures (Exhibit II to this Appendix A), and Note 2
in Notes to Basic Financial Statements (Exhibit I to this Appendix A) for a more in-depth explanation of
these entries and the manner in which they impact the Fund equity balance calculation.
Fiscal 2008
During fiscal year 2008, the City’s revenues increased by 4.6% from fiscal year 2007. The City’s
largest sources of revenues were property taxes, excise taxes, and payment in lieu of taxes totaling $1.49
billion (67.3% of total revenue). Property taxes increased $57.9 million, an increase of 4.6% from the
previous year. Departmental and other increased by $13.4 million, representing a 20.4% change from fiscal
2007. The main factors were: an increase in fringe retirement reimbursement from grants of $1.1 million,
an increase in pension and annuities of $5.4 million. Licenses and permits totaled $46.0 million, a 13.0%
increase from fiscal 2007. The primary factor was a $3.9 million increase in building permit revenues.

A-16

The increase in revenues allowed for an increase in expense categories. The City's expenses covered
a range of services. The largest expenses were for schools ($782.5 million), public safety ($509.3 million),
other employee benefits ($190.2 million), state and district assessments ($132.8 million), debt service
($115.8 million), public works ($108.8 million), and retirement costs ($95.2 million). Schools realized a
$38.7 million (5.2%) increase while public safety realized an expenditure increase of $31.9 million (6.7%).
The driving force behind the increased expenses for schools and public safety were increases in salaries and
employer charges. The rise of the cost of health care was the main proponent for other employee benefits
increasing by $14.3 million. Public works represented a $10.9 million increase primarily due to snow
removal costs. State and district assessments realized a nearly 7.0% increase due to increases in Charter
School Sending Tuition and MBTA Assessments. Debt service expenses increased due to increases in
scheduled principal and interest payments. Retirement costs expenses increased due to an increase in the
City’s actuarially required contribution.
The General Fund’s equity balance as of June 30, 2008 was $802.0 million, as compared to $732.0
million in fiscal 2007. The increase of $70.0 million or 9.6% is primarily due to a continued increase in
Property and Excise Taxes. Please refer to the statements of General Fund activity in the Comparative
Balance Sheets and Statements of revenues and Expenditures (Exhibit II to this Appendix A), and Note 2 in
Notes to the Basic Financial Statements (Exhibit I to this Appendix A) for a more in-depth explanation of
these entries and the manner in which they impact the Fund equity balance calculation.

Financial Administration
Pursuant to state law mandates and policy initiatives, the City has established a system of internal
management controls. These controls are designed to maximize revenue collections, monitor operating and
capital spending, evaluate infrastructure needs, and enhance the City’s internal control in business
procedures. Major components of the City’s system of financial management controls include:
Revenue Collections
The City has implemented a comprehensive accounts receivable management program that
coordinates the collection of departmental revenues. The City has afforded taxpayers the ability to remit
payment for licenses, permits, fees, and fines with credit and debit cards and has given taxpayers an
alternative choice in paying real estate taxes by use of online direct debit. The City secures its statutory lien
for delinquent real estate taxes with instruments recorded at the Suffolk County Registry of Deeds (“tax
takings”). For more information concerning tax takings and collection of delinquent real estate taxes, see
“City Revenues—Property Taxes—Delinquent Taxes and Tax Title.”
Debt Management
The City uses a comprehensive, interactive debt capacity model that assists debt management
administrators in evaluating the potential impact of debt issues on cash flow, credit and statutory debt
capacity.
The Treasury Department manages all City borrowings. The Treasury Department focuses on the
timing of borrowings to take advantage of favorable market conditions and manages the City’s cash flows
to help obviate the need for short-term borrowings for operating purposes. The Treasury Department has
established a series of debt management guidelines and has instituted a debt policy that direct the City’s
approach toward its debt management activities, including rapid debt repayment, the use of a debt capacity
model for establishing debt affordability, limitations on the level of variable rate debt the City will employ,
maintenance of the relationship between debt and repayment sources, target savings for refundings, and
reporting and liaison with the financial community and the rating agencies.
Financial Management
Financial management is supported through the use of the Boston Administrative Information
Systems (BAIS). BAIS is an integrated financial and human resources management system that is designed
to track and control daily activities and report the financial position of the City. BAIS performs the
specialized functions of encumbrance control, budget control, position management, payroll allotment
reporting, fund accounting, and capital project and grant management. Real time edits prohibit excessive
commitments and overspending, while on-line access to information, including monthly revenue and
expenditure reports, allows department managers to evaluate directly the financial status of individual
programs and the entire department. The utilization of these systems supports the rigorous monitoring and
reporting requirements enforced by the City.
The City of Boston has consistently received unqualified opinions on the audit of its Basic Financial
Statements and has been presented with a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting
from the Government Finance Officers Association for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
Investment Policy
The City has enacted and annually reviews and updates its investment policy statement that dictates
the types of investments made by the City Treasury. The policy also focuses on the appropriate balance of
liquidity and the rate of return on investments. Bond proceeds, in conformance with the City’s policy, are
invested in highly liquid, fully collateralized investments.
Performance Management and Program Evaluation
Boston About Results (BAR) is the City’s performance management and evaluation program. At its
core, BAR aims to create a sustainable and reliable performance management system which captures the
core functions of City departments and citywide strategic goals, assists in the decision-making process,
identifies areas of improvement, and effectively communicates performance results to a broad range of
stakeholders.
Using performance management as its foundation, BAR encourages organization changes and
operational improvements that increase the effectiveness and productivity of City departments. The
program does this by providing reliable, objective, and independent information and reports to City
managers about department performance and operations.
A-18

Risk Management
The City of Boston’s Risk Management Program focuses on a planned strategy of self-insurance
supported by strong prevention and cost reduction efforts, financial reserves and catastrophic insurance.
The citywide program first focuses on limiting unnecessary asset losses due, for example, to third
party legal liability claims, property losses, workplace injuries, employee healthcare and unemployment
compensation. The City’s Corporation Counsel defends the City in any lawsuits that arise from the normal
course of operations. Assets and losses are tracked and quantified and areas are targeted for improvement
efforts.
The City budgets and funds for the costs described above through the general fund, except for selfinsured healthcare costs, which are managed by Blue Cross Blue Shield, and financed through an
employee/employer trust fund established in compliance with Section 3A of Chapter 32B of the General
Laws.
To protect the City’s assets from adverse loss, commercial insurance is purchased strategically for
certain exposures. A catastrophic property insurance policy provides $100 million all risk protection after a
$10 million deductible; boiler and machinery losses are insured up to $10 million, and 75% of the City’s
healthcare costs are insured through HMOs.
For unexpected large losses, the City has been continually building a catastrophic risk reserve, the
available balance of which equaled $12.1 million at the end of fiscal 2008.
Energy Management
The Mayor’s Energy Management Board is charged with making decisions regarding the City's
procurement, use, and conservation of energy as well as the minimization of the impact of fossil fuel
consumption on public health. The Energy Management Board is comprised of the City's Director of
Administration and Finance and Collector-Treasurer, Chief of Environmental and Energy Services, Chief
of Public Property, and Chief of Public Health.
The Energy Management Board commissioned an Integrated Energy Management Plan that is
intended to assure progress toward the fulfillment of its mission. The Integrated Energy Management Plan
was finalized in fiscal 2006.
Two significant projects identified in the Integrated Energy Management Plan are underway. Energy
efficient lighting controls are being installed in Boston City Hall and a similar project at the main branch of
the Boston Public Library is in the planning stages.
Since March 2005, the City has independently contracted with third party electricity suppliers to meet
all of the City's electricity supply requirements. To date, the supply costs the City has paid to its third party
electricity supplier have been less than the default supply costs offered by the City's local electricity
distribution company, NSTAR - Boston Edison (BECo).
CITY REVENUES
The principal sources of City revenue available to meet operating expenditures are Property Taxes,
State Aid, Excise Revenues, Departmental Revenues, and Federal and State Grants, all of which are
described below. Except as specifically noted, all amounts are stated on a budgetary accounting basis.
References to fiscal 2009 are unaudited.
Property Taxes
Real and personal property taxes are the largest single source of the City’s revenue. The City’s gross
property tax levy for fiscal 2009 equals $1.40 billion, or 58.0% of City General Fund revenues for such
period. Certain properties are subject to arrangements that suspend the imposition of real property taxes at
normal rates in order to encourage development. See “City Revenues—Property Taxes—Revenues from
Chapter 121A Properties” below.
As discussed below, Proposition 2½ limits the level of property taxation in the City. In fiscal 2009,
the City will again levy taxes below the 2.5% ceiling on the overall effective tax rate. The City is not
expected to reach the levy ceiling in the foreseeable future due to previous growth in the real estate market.
Proposition 2½
Proposition 2½ is a statewide tax limitation subject to amendment or repeal by the legislature that
imposes two separate limits on the annual tax levy of a city or town.
The primary limitation of Proposition 2½ is that the property tax levy in any city or town in the
Commonwealth cannot exceed 2.5% of the full and fair cash valuation of the taxable real estate and
A-19

personal property in that city or town (the “2½ ceiling”). The only exception is the temporary exclusion of
debt service or capital costs from the levy ceiling restrictions, as described below.
Within the limits of the 2½ ceiling, the Growth Levy Limit is a secondary limitation imposed by
Proposition 2½. The Growth Levy Limit prohibits the levy in a fiscal year from exceeding an amount equal
to 102.5% of the maximum allowable limit for the preceding year, subject to exceptions for the following:
property newly added to the tax rolls and valuation increases other than as a result of a general revaluation
(“new growth”); temporary exclusions from the tax levy limitation to pay for capital costs or debt service
on indebtedness; and “overrides,” which are permanent increases in the tax levy for general expenditures of
the city or town. Exclusions and overrides must be approved by a referendum of the voters of the city or
town. The levy is permanently increased by the addition of new growth and overrides, except that any
override to fund a stabilization fund will not be taken into account in calculating the maximum levy limit in
subsequent fiscal years unless the City Council votes to appropriate such increased amount in such
subsequent year to the stabilization fund. The exclusion of debt service by referendum temporarily
increases the levy amount and the duration of the specific debt excluded. The Growth Levy Limit may be
exceeded by an override in any year by a majority vote of the voters. An increase in the Growth Levy Limit
under this procedure, however, does not permit a tax levy in excess of the 2½ ceiling, since the two
limitations apply independently. The applicable tax limits may also be reduced in any year by a majority
vote of the voters. The City’s gross levy in fiscal 2009 equals $1.40 billion. In fiscal 2009, the allowable
2.5% increase is $33.4 million, and “new growth” is $32.8 million.
In order to mitigate its adverse impact on local government revenues, Proposition 2½ limits the
annual rate of increase of aggregate, statewide assessments made upon cities and towns by the
Commonwealth and certain of its governmental entities, such as assessments made upon the City and
certain other cities and towns for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (“MBTA”), to 2.5% of
the prior year’s assessment. Proposition 2½ also limits the motor vehicle excise tax rate to 2.5%.
The City’s Bond Procedure Act of 1983 mandates assessment of taxes in excess of the Proposition
2½ levy limits to the extent that the debt service on City obligations is not otherwise provided for in the tax
levy or from other sources, with no allowance made for any other expenditures of the City. See “City
Indebtedness—Classification of City Debt.”

The Growth Levy Limit is the maximum allowable levy as determined by Proposition 2½.
For each fiscal year, the amount of the actual tax levy is the largest amount possible. The Growth Levy Limit would be exceeded
if the tax rate were raised an additional cent ($0.01).

Revaluation
State law mandates a revaluation of all taxable property every three years. These revaluations are
reviewed and certified by the Commonwealth. In the years between revaluations, the Commonwealth
permits municipalities to establish new values on the basis of market changes, using the most recent
revaluation as a basis. The City has adjusted certified property values in accordance with this procedure in
years when market conditions indicated such adjustment was necessary.
In November 2006, the City concluded work on its ninth three-year revaluation for fiscal 2007. The
assessment date for fiscal 2007 was January 1, 2006. The City will commence the tenth three-year
revaluation for fiscal year 2010, with an assessment date of January 1, 2009. For fiscal 2009, assessments
were trended based on market activity leading up to the assessment date of January 1, 2008. Fiscal 2009
assessments for most residential properties have declined. The magnitude of the reduction was dependent
on local real estate market conditions. In some areas, residential values remained stable or declined
slightly. In other neighborhoods, including those impacted by foreclosure activity, there were more
significant value declines. As of the assessment date, the commercial market demonstrated modest growth.

City of Boston Assessing Department.

The City has five classes of property for taxation purposes: (i) residential real property, (ii) open
space land, and (iii) commercial, (iv) industrial and (v) personal property. The City has utilized this
classification in adopting its fiscal 1983 through fiscal 2009 tax rates. Within limits under state law, the
City may determine the share of the annual levy to be borne by each of the categories. Under these
statutory limits, the residential tax rate cannot be given a discount greater than 50%, while the business tax
rate cannot exceed 175% of the overall effective tax rate.
The City may also exempt a portion of the assessed valuation of residential real property when used
as the taxpayer's principal residence. The amount of the residential exemption can equal up to 30% of the
A-21

average assessed value of all residential property in the City. In fiscal 2009, qualifying residents who
receive the residential exemption have their taxable assessed values reduced by $129,385. The residential
exemption has no impact on the overall tax rate.
Tax Base
The following table shows, for purposes of year-to-year comparison, the assessed valuations with

The methodology used in creating the table involves the search of the title holder, or holders, of all major parcels of property in
the City. This methodology does not necessarily locate all parcels owned by affiliates nor does it differentiate between
percentage ownership in a particular parcel.
Pursuant to Chapter 59 of the General Laws, Section 4, personal property consists of movable physical items not permanently
attached to real estate. Many items of personal property are exempt from taxation in Massachusetts. There are three general types
of personal property that are taxable: business and professional furnishings, household furnishings in property other than the
principal residence (for example, a summer house), and personal property of public utilities.
In February 2007, the Blackstone Group LP completed the acquisition of office space held by Equity Office Properties.
In prior years, properties owned by John Hancock Life Insurance were attributed to Manulife Financial, a related corporate
entity.

The City’s property tax bills are mailed quarterly in July, October, December, and April. The bills
mailed in July and October represent preliminary tax bills each equal to one quarter of the previous fiscal
year’s liability. The fair cash value of the property or assessment for the purpose of determining the new
fiscal year tax liability is reflected in the third and fourth quarter bills, which are mailed in December and
April. See “City Revenues—Property Taxes—Taxation by Use; Tax Rates.”
Delinquent Taxes and Tax Titles
Real and personal property taxes (not including motor vehicle, the room occupancy and the aircraft
fuel excises) are based on values established by the Assessing Department as of each January 1, and are due
in quarterly payments every August, November, February and May. Delinquent real estate and personal
property taxes are subject to a 14% per annum interest charge. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year in
which real estate taxes become delinquent, the City secures its lien for such taxes by taking legal title to all
delinquent properties, subject to the owners’ right of redemption. After this process, known as a “tax
taking,” is complete, interest accrues on outstanding amounts of delinquent real estate taxes at the rate of
16% per annum. If the taxes remain unpaid for a period of six months from the tax taking, the City may
petition the Land Court to foreclose the equity owner’s right of redemption. Upon foreclosure, the City may
then sell the property in order to liquidate the tax liability. The City estimates that the value of the
properties to which such tax titles are attached is substantially less than the amount of delinquent taxes,
charges, and interest owed.
Tax title receipts were $13.7 million, $12.3 million and $16.9 million, respectively, in fiscal 2006,
2007 and 2008.
Revenues from Chapter 121A Corporations
A local government in cooperation with its redevelopment authorities may suspend the imposition of
real property taxes at normal levels on properties determined to be “blighted” in order to encourage
redevelopment of such properties by special corporations organized under Chapter 121A (“Chapter 121A
Corporations”). The City receives three forms of revenue from Chapter 121A Corporations. The first
consists of excise PILOTs for each Chapter 121A Corporation that are collected by the Commonwealth and
distributed to the City. The second form of revenue is contract payments resulting from agreements that
may be entered into between the Chapter 121A Corporation and the City relating to City services available
to the development. A third form of revenue does not generate significant payments.
Revenue received by the City from Chapter 121A Corporations for the last three fiscal years are
shown in the following table.

State Aid
State aid is the second largest revenue source to the City’s General Fund after property taxes. Due to
the national recession, the state has developed a sizeable structural budget deficit, in the current budget
year. Approximately $2.5 billion dollars in cost reduction measures have been undertaken by the Governor
in order to reduce this deficit including reductions in local aid to municipalities. Of the City’s major aid
categories, Additional Assistance and Lottery have been reduced mid-year while Chapter 70 education aid
has been spared. The City has received reductions in these two accounts for the current fiscal year totaling
$22.9 million or 4.6% of general fund aid expected.
Fiscal 2009 state aid to the City was expected to increase by $11.3 million to $504.6 million, a 2.3%
increase over the $493.3 million received in fiscal 2008. The City now expects an $11.5 million or 2.4%
decrease in state aid instead.
Since certification of the tax rate on December 15, 2008, the City has received notification of
emergency reductions in state aid revenue in the current fiscal year 2009. These reductions were made by
the Governor through authority granted by the Legislature. The City’s reduction, to be incurred in equal
parts over the last two quarterly state aid distributions in fiscal 2009, will total $22.9 million. The City
expects to absorb this reduction through surpluses in other revenues and cost saving measures put in place
prior to the announcement of these reductions.
Under the Massachusetts Constitution and state finance law, the State Treasurer has the authority to
delay the allotment of state aid appropriations under certain circumstances. In addition, the statute
governing the distribution of school aid provides that such payments are due only to the extent that
sufficient funds are available. The State Treasurer is also empowered to deduct from state aid amounts
appropriated to the City the amount of “charges” or “assessments.” The largest of these assessments are
those for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and Charter School Tuition.
Assessments also include smaller charges for various state-provided services, and may include debt service
paid by the Commonwealth on “qualified bonds” of the City and any sums allocable to the Boston Water
and Sewer Commission or the City that are due and unpaid on debt issued to the Massachusetts Water
Pollution Abatement Trust. The City has no “qualified bonds” outstanding and has never been assessed for
unpaid amounts due the Trust.
Total fiscal 2009 state assessments are expected to amount to $143.1 million. Total assessments
amounted to $119.8 million and $128.3 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, respectively. State aid to the
City in fiscal 2009 net of fiscal 2009 assessments (after mid-year reductions noted above) is expected to
decrease $26.5 million, or 7.3%, to $338.5 million. Net state aid totaled $365.1 million in fiscal 2008 and
$363.2 million in fiscal 2007. The City’s net state aid remains $89.8 million below its fiscal 2002 peak
distribution.
In addition to direct state aid, the City also receives reimbursement for the cost of teachers’ pensions.
Teachers’ pensions are paid directly by the State Teachers Retirement System for all teacher retirees in the
state other than those who retire from the Boston school system. In their case, pensions are paid by the
State-Boston Retirement System, funded by the City, and the City is reimbursed by the Commonwealth on
an actual pension payout basis. The City received $85.5 million, $93.3 million, and $105.4 million,
respectively, in fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008. The City expects to receive approximately $105.4 million of
reimbursement in fiscal 2009. As part of this reimbursement, the City also receives, subject to annual
appropriation by the state legislature, cost of living adjustments approved prior to fiscal 1998 by the
legislature for municipal employees. See “The City—Retirement Systems.”
State School Building Assistance
Under its school building assistance program, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts provides grants
to cities, towns and regional school districts for school construction projects. Until July 26, 2004, the State
Board of Education was responsible for approving grants for school projects and otherwise administering
the program. Grant amounts ranged from 50% to 90% of approved project costs. Municipalities generally
issued bonds to finance the entire project cost, and the Commonwealth disbursed the grants in equal annual
installments over the term of the related bonds. Approved project costs included the interest expense
incurred on debt issued by a municipality to finance the school project.
Due to demand for school building assistance grants far exceeding available funds, the state
legislature created the Massachusetts School Building Authority (the “Authority”) in 2004 to finance and
administer the school building assistance program. The Authority has assumed all powers and obligations
of the State Board of Education with respect to the program. In addition to certain other amounts, the
legislation dedicates a portion of Commonwealth sales tax receipts to the Authority to finance the program.
A-24

Projects previously approved for grants by the State Board of Education are entitled to receive grant
payments from the Authority based on the approved project cost and reimbursement rate applicable under
the prior law. As of March 1, 2009, the City had approximately $41.4 million of bonds outstanding for
school projects approved for grants under the prior law at a reimbursement rate of 90% of approved project
costs. The Authority has paid and is expected to continue to pay the remaining amounts of the grants for
such projects in annual installments to reimburse debt service on bonds issued by the City to finance such
projects.
Projects on the State Board of Education’s project priority waiting list as of July 1, 2004 are also
entitled to receive grant payments from the Authority based on the eligible project costs and reimbursement
rates applicable under the prior law. In 2005, the Authority approved grants at a reimbursement rate of
90% of approved project costs for three City projects on the priority waiting list as of July 1, 2004. In
January 2009, the City and the Authority executed a project funding agreement for Burke High School, the
last City school project on the priority waiting list as of July 1, 2004, that will provide up to $42.4 million
in State support for the project.
The Authority recently promulgated new regulations with respect to the application and approval
process for new projects. The range of reimbursement rates for such projects has been reduced to between
40% and 80% of approved project costs. In addition, the Authority expects to pay grants for such projects
as project costs are incurred pursuant to a project funding agreement between the Authority and the
municipality. In most cases, the receipt of these progress payments from the Authority will eliminate the
need for the municipality to borrow on a temporary basis to finance the Authority’s share of project costs.
However, none of the interest expense incurred on debt issued by municipalities to finance their portion of
the costs of new projects will be included in the approved project costs eligible for reimbursement.
On July 1, 2007 the Authority began accepting statements of interest from municipalities and school
districts describing proposed new projects. One of the City’s project proposals was accepted by the
Authority for further consideration. The Authority has not yet determined the feasibility of the project and
it remains in the pre-approval stage. The ongoing analysis and consideration of the City’s project proposal
by the Authority does not represent or imply a commitment by the Authority to fund the project. The
Authority’s financial commitment to the project is only determined through the project funding agreement
after careful analysis and the development of architectural and engineering documents.
Excise Revenues
In addition to the major sources of revenue described above, the City receives various other types of
revenues. See “Financial Operations—Summary and Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary
Basis)—Fiscal 2004-2008” above. The following is a description of significant excise revenue sources of
the City.
Room Occupancy Excise
The City currently has in effect a 4% local room occupancy excise upon the transfer of occupancy of
any room in a hotel, lodging house or motel. The Commonwealth collects this tax and distributes it to the
City quarterly. The City’s room occupancy excise receipts totaled $30.5 million, $35.1 million, and $40.3
million respectively, in fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008.
Pursuant to Chapter 152 of the Acts of 1997, as amended (the “Convention Center Act”), the City has
established the City of Boston Room Occupancy Excise Fund (the “Excise Fund”) to provide for the
payment of the principal of and interest on indebtedness issued by the City to fund the City’s share of costs
of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center Project (the “BCEC Project”). See “City Indebtedness—
Special Obligation Debt.”
Of the $40.3 million in room occupancy excise taxes collected in fiscal 2008, $17.3 million was
retained in the Excise Fund, and $23.0 million was transferred into the General Fund as authorized by the
Convention Center Act. In fiscal 2007, $15.1 million of the $35.1 million in room occupancy excise taxes
collected was retained in the Excise Fund and $20.0 million was transferred into the General Fund. In fiscal
2006, $12.5 million of the $30.5 million in room occupancy excise taxes collected was retained in the
Excise Fund and $18.0 million was transferred into the General Fund.
Aircraft Fuel Excise
The City also assesses an aircraft fuel excise upon the sale of jet fuel. The Commonwealth collects
this tax and distributes it to the City quarterly. The City’s aircraft fuel excise receipts totaled $19.9 million,
$24.3 million, and $18.8 million respectively, in fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008. It should be noted that the
City received three quarterly excise payments in fiscal 2008, with the fourth quarter received in fiscal 2009.
See “Summary and Comparison of Operating Budgets—Fiscal 2009—Revenues.”
A-25

Motor Vehicle Excise
The Commonwealth assesses an excise on the registration of motor vehicles, the proceeds of which
are received by the municipality where the vehicle is principally garaged. The excise is a uniform rate of
$25 per $1,000 of vehicle valuation. The City’s annual motor vehicle excise receipts totaled $50.1 million,
$34.5 million, and $49.6 million respectively, in fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008. See “Summary and
Comparison of Operating Budgets—Fiscal 2009—Revenues.”
Vehicular Rental Surcharge
The Commonwealth imposes a $10 surcharge on each vehicular rental transaction contract in the
City. One dollar of each surcharge is paid to the City for deposit in the City’s Excise Fund for application
to the payment of the principal of and interest on indebtedness issued by the City to fund the City’s share of
costs of the BCEC Project. The City’s annual share of vehicular rental surcharges totaled $1.4 million, $1.2
million, and $1.0 million respectively, in fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008. See “City Indebtedness—Special
Obligation Debt.”
Departmental Revenues
Several City departments generate significant revenues from fees and charges.
Parking Fines
The City’s annual parking fine receipts totaled $64.0 million, $62.8 million, and $63.3 million
respectively, in fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008.
Building Permit Fees
The Inspectional Services Department performs a variety of functions for which fees are imposed
such as the granting of building permits. The City’s annual building permit fees totaled $26.3 million,
$27.9 million and $31.7 million respectively, in fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008.
Municipal Medicaid Reimbursement
The Office of Budget Management oversees a vendor contract to collect federal reimbursements for
Medicaid eligible services provided through the Boston Public Schools. The City’s annual municipal
Medicaid reimbursement revenue totaled $13.5 million, $18.4 million and $15.8 million respectively, in
fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008.
Other Available Revenues
Under state law, proceeds of the sale of City facilities must be applied to the Surplus Property
Disposition Fund to be used to finance capital projects, unless the City Council, with the approval of the
Mayor, votes to credit to the General Fund the difference between the sale proceeds and the amount of debt
(both principal and interest) incurred in acquiring or improving the sold facility. As of June 30, 2008, there
was $30.1 million remaining in the Surplus Property Disposition Fund.
Grants
The City receives both federal and state grant funds, some of which are determined according to
formulas, and others that are awarded competitively. These monies are recorded in special revenue funds.
Federal Grants
Some major sources of federal grant funds in fiscal 2008 included: the Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) Entitlement Program award of $20.4 million; the Home Investment Partnership
Program (HOME) award of $8.0 million; the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program
(HOPWA) award of $1.7 million; the Supportive Housing Program award of $11.7 million; and the Shelter
Plus Care Program award of $6.4 million. The Boston Public Schools major programs included: The Title I
Elementary & Secondary Education Act of 1965 award of $45.1 million; Special Education Entitlement
Grant awards of $19.2 million; and the School Lunch Program awards of $23.0 million. The Boston Public
Schools were also awarded $21.3 million from a variety of other federal grants sources during the 2008
fiscal year. Homeland Security grant awards totaled $14.6 million.
State Grants
In addition to State Aid, the City receives state grants. The Commonwealth assumes 100% of the
capital costs and funds 96% of the operating costs associated with the Office of the Sheriff of Suffolk
County, an award totaling $95.8 million in fiscal 2008. The Police Department also received Community
Services grant awards that totaled $8.3 million from the Office of Public Safety. The Fire Department also
A-26

received Firefighter grant awards that totaled $2.3 million from the Office of Public Safety. The Boston
Public Schools were awarded approximately $32.0 million. The three major programs supported by the
state education grants are the Special Education Student 50/50 Program totaling $12.3 million, the
Community Partnership Grants totaling $9.4 million and the Quality Full-Day Kindergarten Grant totaling
$2.7 million.
CITY INDEBTEDNESS
Classification of City Debt
Direct general obligation debt of the City is debt for which the City’s full faith and credit are pledged
and for the payment of which all taxable property in the City is subject to ad valorem taxation without limit
as to rate or amount. General obligation bonds of the City may also be secured in certain circumstances by
a pledge of specific City revenues. The special obligation debt of the City is debt, which may be secured
solely by a pledge of specific revenues derived from a revenue-producing facility of the City or for the
payment of which the City’s obligation is subject to annual appropriation.
General Obligation Debt
On June 30, 2008, the City had outstanding approximately $912.1 million of general obligation longterm bonds, all of which bear fixed rates of interest. On March 1, 2009, the City had approximately $831.1
million of bonds outstanding.
The City is authorized to secure any of its general obligation indebtedness by a pledge of all or any
part of any revenues of the City including, without limitation, any tax, such as real property taxes, any fees
payable to or for the account of the City, and certain receipts, distributions and reimbursements held or to
be received by the City from the Commonwealth. The City currently has no general obligation bonds or
notes outstanding secured by such a pledge.
Debt Limits
All debt of the City requires the authorization of the City Council and approval of the Mayor. If the
Mayor vetoes a loan order passed by the City Council, the charter of the City provides that the loan order is
void and may not be passed over the Mayor’s veto. Authorization of bonds under a loan order of the City
Council includes, unless otherwise provided, the authorization to issue temporary notes in anticipation of
such bonds.
The statutory debt limit for the City consists of a debt limit and a double debt limit. The debt limit is
5%, and the double debt limit is 10%, of the valuation of taxable property in the City as last equalized by
the State Department of Revenue. Biannually, prior to January 31st, the Commissioner of Revenue
establishes a final equalized valuation which is the basis for determining the debt limit for the following
two-year period or until another equalization has been established. The equalized valuation of taxable
property in the City established by the Commissioner of Revenue in January 2009 equals $105.88 billion.
Based on the current equalized valuation, the City’s debt limit equals approximately $5.29 billion, and its
double debt limit equals $10.59 billion.
The City may authorize debt up to its debt limit without state approval. The City may authorize debt
over the debt limit up to the double debt limit with the approval of the Municipal Finance Oversight Board,
composed of the State Treasurer and Receiver General, the State Auditor, the Attorney General and the
Director of Accounts. As of June 30, 2008, the City had outstanding debt of $709.6 million subject to the
debt limit, and authorized but unissued debt subject to the debt limit of $477.9 million. In addition, as of
March 1, 2009, the City had outstanding debt of $648.4 million subject to the debt limit, and authorized but
unissued debt subject to the debt limit of $628.9 million. Based on the City’s current debt limit of $5.29
billion, the City had the capacity to authorize an additional $4.02 billion of debt as of March 1, 2009.

There are many categories of general obligation debt, which are not subject to the debt limit and are
therefore not included in the Debt Incurring Capacity table above. Some such debt is, however, subject to
other debt limits, dollar limitations or state approval. As of March 1, 2009, the City had a total of $831.1
million in long term debt outstanding, of which $182.8 million was exempt from the debt limit. As of that
date the City also had $86.4 million of long-term debt that was authorized but unissued and exempt from
the debt limit.
Authorized But Unissued Debt
The size of the City’s future bond issues will be consistent with the City’s financial management
policies regarding its level of debt and debt service. The following table sets forth the amounts and
purposes of authorized but unissued general obligation debt of the City as of March 1, 2009:

Short-Term Borrowings
Although the City is authorized to borrow for operating purposes through the issuance of short-term
notes in anticipation of revenue receipts, it has not done so in several years. In addition, the City is
authorized to issue short-term debt obligations (“BANs”) in anticipation of the issuance of long-term
bonds. Currently, no BANs are outstanding.

A-31

Special Obligation Debt
In addition to general obligation indebtedness, the Bond Procedure Act of 1983 and various other
special acts authorize the City to incur indebtedness which is secured by and payable solely from certain
revenues of the City which are pledged for the payment of such indebtedness or which are subject to annual
appropriation by the City for such purpose. The only special obligation indebtedness of the City
outstanding as of March 1, 2009 was $87.8 million Special Obligation Refunding Bonds, Boston City
Hospital Issue (the “BCH Bonds”) and $100.5 Convention Center Loan, Act of 1997, Special Obligation
Bonds, Series A (the “Convention Center Bonds”).
The BCH Bonds were issued in 2002 in connection with the restructuring of debt originally incurred
by the City in 1990 (and refunded in 1993) to finance a major construction and renovation program for the
City’s former acute care hospital then known as Boston City Hospital (“BCH”). On July 1, 1996, the
operations of BCH and Boston University Medical Center Hospital were consolidated into Boston Medical
Center, which is owned and operated by the Boston Medical Center Corporation (“BMCC”), a private
Massachusetts non-profit corporation. Simultaneously with the consolidation, all other public health
operations of the City’s Department of Health and Hospitals, as well as title to BCH, were transferred to the
Boston Public Health Commission (the “Commission”), and the BCH campus was leased to BMCC for an
initial term of 50 years.
The BCH Bonds are special obligations of the City payable from, and secured solely by a pledge and
assignment of amounts payable on a promissory note issued to the City by the Commission. The
promissory note is in turn a special obligation of the Commission secured by an assignment and pledge of
rents payable by BMCC to the Commission under the lease of the BCH campus and, upon any failure of
BMCC to pay all or any part of such rent, the proceeds of certain assistance grants payable by the City to
BMCC. The payment of assistance grants to BMCC is subject to annual appropriation by the City and the
payment of rent by BMCC is contingent upon the appropriation and payment of such assistance grants. The
rent payments and the assistance grants are each at least equal, in amount and terms of payment, to the
principal and interest payable on the BCH Bonds. The City has also covenanted and agreed, subject to
appropriation, to meet any deficiency in the amounts otherwise pledged for the payment of the BCH Bonds.
The BCH Bonds do not constitute general obligations of the City and the full faith and credit of the City are
not pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on the BCH Bonds.
The Convention Center Bonds were issued by the City in April, 2002 pursuant to Chapter 152 of the
Acts of 1997, as amended (the “Convention Center Act”), to permanently finance certain costs incurred by
the City in connection with the development of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center (the “BCEC
Project”), a joint development of the City, acting through the Boston Redevelopment Authority (the
“BRA”), which was responsible for the acquisition, preparation and remediation of the site for the BCEC
Project, and the Commonwealth, acting through the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority (the
“MCCA”), which was responsible for the construction of the project and which owns and operates the
facility. As provided in the Convention Center Act, the City has reimbursed the BRA for $176.8 million of
site costs for the BCEC Project, funded in part from the proceeds of the Convention Center Bonds and in
part from special revenues accumulated by the City since enactment of the Convention Center Act,
including the proceeds from the sale of hackney (taxi) medallions authorized by the Convention Center
Act.
The Convention Center Bonds are special obligations of the City payable from, and secured solely by
a pledge of, certain “Pledged Receipts,” including all amounts received by the City from a 4% local option
room occupancy excise imposed in Boston and from a portion of a surcharge imposed by the
Commonwealth on vehicular rental transaction contracts in Boston. See “City Revenues-Excise Revenues.”
The Convention Center Bonds do not constitute general obligations of the City and the full faith and credit
of the City are not pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Convention Center Bonds.
The Convention Center Act authorizes the City to annually transfer to the City’s General Fund all
Pledged Receipts that are not required for the payment of the Convention Center Bonds. The City
anticipates that room occupancy excise receipts that are attributable to lodging establishments that were
first opened for business after July 1, 1997 (a measuring date provided in the Convention Center Act),
together with the other Pledged Receipts held under the Convention Center Trust Agreement, will be
sufficient to pay the future debt service on the Convention Center Bonds. Accordingly, the City anticipates
that excise tax receipts that were historically available to fund annual operating expenditures of the City
will be available for transfer to the General Fund. In fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008, excise tax receipts in
excess of the debt service requirements on the Convention Center Bonds were transferred to the General
Fund in the amount of $18.0 million, $20.0 million and $23.0 million, respectively. See “City RevenuesExcise Revenues-Room Occupancy Excise,” above.
A-32

Debt of Agencies Related to the City
In addition to general obligation and special obligation indebtedness of the City, the City and certain
agencies related to the City are authorized to issue debt which is solely an obligation of the agency or
which, although issued by the City, are payable solely from revenues derived from projects financed by
such debt. Except as described below, such obligations do not constitute a debt of the City.
Boston Water and Sewer Commission
The Boston Water and Sewer Commission (the “Commission”) is an independent body politic and
corporate and a political subdivision of the Commonwealth created in July 1977. The Commission, among
its other powers, is authorized to operate and maintain the water and sewer systems of the City, construct
improvements to the systems, collect user charges for its services, and finance its activities and its
borrowing through its revenues. The City is not obligated on debt issued by the Commission. The
Commission’s user charges, as required by statute, are designed to produce revenues to the Commission
sufficient to pay all of its current operating expenses. These user charges are anticipated to increase
moderately. The City’s property tax base is not used to subsidize water and sewer services. Water and
sewer charges outstanding from certain of the Commission’s prior fiscal years have been committed to the
City for collection. The City uses its lien and foreclosure powers to collect those overdue water and sewer
charges for those years on the Commission’s behalf.
Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston
The Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston (“EDIC”) is a body politic and
corporate and an instrumentality of the Commonwealth with a board of five members, also appointed as the
members of the Boston Redevelopment Authority (“BRA”). EDIC has a variety of powers to assist
industrial development projects in the City including the power to issue special obligation revenue bonds to
finance economic development projects in the City, which are solely the obligation of EDIC or the owner
or lessee of the financed project. The City is also authorized to appropriate or borrow monies in aid of
EDIC development projects within certain urban renewal debt limitations.
Boston Redevelopment Authority
The BRA is a public body politic and corporate constituting the City’s redevelopment authority. It
acts as the City’s planning board and exercises certain powers of the state Department of Housing and
Community Development. The BRA board consists of four members appointed by the Mayor, subject to
confirmation by the City Council, and one appointed by the state Department of Housing and Community
Development. The staff includes architects, economists, engineers, lawyers and urban planners, as well as
management personnel and administrative support. The BRA provides the planning support for major
construction, development and redevelopment activity in the City. Although the BRA is authorized to issue
revenue bonds and notes which would not constitute indebtedness of the City, BRA projects have
traditionally been financed through a combination of federal and state grants, the proceeds of general
obligation bonds issued by the City and revenues from the lease or sale of land.
Boston Public Health Commission
The Boston Public Health Commission is a body politic and corporate and a political subdivision of
the Commonwealth created in June 1996 as the successor to the City’s Department of Health and Hospitals.
See “The City—Principal Government Services—Public Health.” The Commission is responsible for the
implementation of public health programs in the City and serves as the board of health of the City. In
addition to its other powers, the Commission is authorized by its enabling act, with the approval of the City
Council and the Mayor, to borrow money for any of its corporate purposes from the City or from the
Massachusetts Health and Educational Facilities Authority. Debt of the Commission is not a debt or other
obligation of the City. Other than the promissory note described below, no debt of the Commission is
currently outstanding.
Pursuant to agreements between the City, the Commission, BMCC and a trustee for the benefit of the
registered owners of the BCH Bonds, the Commission has agreed to apply rents received from BMCC to
the payment of a promissory note issued by the Commission to the City and assigned by the City as
security for the BCH Bonds. Payments made by the Commission on the note are applied by the City to pay
the principal of and interest on the BCH Refunding Bonds. See “City Indebtedness-Special Obligation
Debt.”
The Commission is also obligated to reimburse the City for debt service paid on all outstanding
general obligation bonds of the City issued for public health and hospital purposes. Such bonds were
outstanding on March 1, 2009 in the aggregate principal amount of $7.0 million. The Commission has
A-33

required, and can be expected to continue to require, substantial financial support from the City to maintain
its public health mission and programs, including satisfaction of its obligations described above.
Other Agencies and Corporations
Two other public bodies are empowered, either by themselves or through the City, to issue special
obligation revenue bonds. The BHA is responsible for the construction, financing and operation of
residential housing for low-income persons. While the City provides certain municipal services to BHA
developments, and capital expenditures for City infrastructure related to those developments, the City is not
directly or indirectly liable for operating or debt service expenses of the BHA. The City, acting by and
through the Boston Industrial Development Financing Authority, is authorized to issue revenue bonds to
finance the construction of industrial, commercial and pollution-control facilities. The City has also
traditionally provided financial assistance to a number of nonprofit corporations organized to provide and
conduct civic and charitable functions for residents and visitors to the City and to stimulate the economic
development of the City.
Major Contractual Obligations
In addition to its debt obligations, the City has substantial contractual obligations. Included in this
category are the City’s obligation for pension benefit payments to its contributory retirement system for
City employees which is included in the annual tax levy (see “Retirement Systems”); agreements for the
provision of sanitation, solid waste collection and disposal services (see “The City—Principal Government
Services—Public Works”); and agreements with BMCC for the provision of operating assistance and
capital grants (see “City Indebtedness—Special Obligation Debt” and “Debt of Agencies Related to the
City—Boston Public Health Commission” above) The City has also executed several equipment lease
agreements in order to finance the acquisition of departmental equipment. As of March 1, 2009, the amount
outstanding under the lease agreements equaled $31.0 million. Lease payments are subject to annual
appropriation, and are not included in the City’s debt limit.
Capital Planning and Borrowing Program
Capital Planning Process
The capital planning process is organized to coincide with the annual budget cycle. It begins when
City departments submit capital requests, and concludes when the City publishes an updated version of its
five-year capital plan. Capital appropriations are requested of the City Council each year for the cost of
projects included in the updated capital plan. This process allows for a continuing reassessment of capital
needs and projections. On April 9, 2008, the Mayor submitted his fiscal 2009 budget to the City Council,
which included approximately $150.7 million in new authorizations to support the fiscal 2009 capital plan.
All authorizations were approved by the City Council on June 18, 2008, and became effective in July 2008.
The City awards construction contracts and incurs capital outlay costs based upon appropriations to
be funded from bond proceeds and grant receipts. In circumstances where project expenditures occur prior
to the receipt of bond proceeds or grant reimbursements, the City temporarily pays such costs from
available funds.
Capital Funding Plan
The City funds its capital plan primarily through the issuance of general obligation bonds. The size of
the City’s future bond issues will be consistent with the City’s financial management policies regarding its
level of debt and debt service. The timing and size of the capital plan will be actively managed within these
constraints.
Current Capital Investment Plans
The City’s fiscal 2009-2013 capital plan released in April 2008 proposes new long-term investments
over the next 5-7 years as well as several studies to lay the groundwork for future growth. In all, $1.52
billion from City and non-City sources are proposed to be spent on capital projects. These expenditures will
be used for improvements to schools, libraries, parks and recreation, roads and bridges. In view of the
proven economic and social benefits of consistent, long-range capital planning, the City remains committed
to moving forward with its capital program.
The fiscal 2009-2013 capital plan includes projects to improve the physical condition of the City’s
schools. In addition to ongoing roof replacements, masonry repairs and fire alarm systems upgrades, the
City completed an addition to and a renovation of Burke High School in September, 2008. The project
incorporated the construction of a new neighborhood branch library into the school addition that will
replace an existing branch library building. Construction was also completed on a new neighborhood police
A-34

station in Charlestown. A new branch library will open in Mattapan in the spring of 2009 replacing an older
facility. Going forward, LEED certifiable renovations will begin on a branch library and planning for
energy efficiency improvements at the central library will be underway.
The maintenance of the City’s roadways and sidewalks is a significant part of the capital plan. In
fiscal 2008, 38.5 miles of roads were reconstructed or resurfaced and 351,139 square feet of sidewalks were
also repaired. Approximately 318 new street lights were installed to improve visibility and public safety.
Since its inception, the capital plan has comprehensively examined the capital needs of the City and
has emphasized long-term planning and financial management. This planning process has enabled the City
to alter the pattern of decades of previous under investment and to respond to emerging program goals of
its departments.
For a description of the City’s expenditures in support of the BCEC see “City Indebtedness – Special
Obligation Debt” above.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Retirement Systems
The City’s employees are not participants in the federal social security system. The City participates
in a contributory defined benefit retirement system that is administered by the State-Boston Retirement
System (“SBRS”). The SBRS provides pension benefits to retired City employees under a state
contributory retirement statute, and is administered by a Retirement Board comprised of five members: the
City Auditor, who serves ex-officio; two individuals elected by members of the system; an individual
chosen by the Mayor; and an individual chosen by the other four members or appointed by the Mayor if the
other four members do not agree on a selection within thirty days of a vacancy. All retirement allowances
are primarily paid by employer and employee contributions and the resulting investment earnings.
Employee contributions in the form of a mandatory deduction from regular compensation constitute an
annuity fund from which the annuity portion of the retirement allowance is paid.
The City is committed to funding based upon a schedule approved by the SBRS and the state actuary,
which includes paying the current year’s estimated present value of benefits earned during the year
(“normal cost”) and an annual contribution toward reducing the unfunded liability to zero by the year 2023.
This schedule is calculated in accordance with the entry age actuarial cost method. The schedule is updated
by SBRS and subject to approval at least every three years by the state Public Employee Retirement
Administration Commission (“PERAC”), a state agency established to oversee all 106 Massachusetts
public retirement systems. The SBRS most recently received approval for a funding schedule for fiscal
2010, 2011, and 2012. The latest approved schedule targets full funding of the system five years prior to the
legally required funding date of 2028. The annual appropriation, based on the funding schedule, is a legal
obligation of the City that must be included as part of the property tax rate certification by the
Commonwealth.
Beginning January 1, 2000, the Board adopted an asset valuation method that gradually incorporates
over time annual investment gains over and losses under the actuarial investment return assumption of 8%.
The actuarial value of assets is used in determining the funding schedule, thereby avoiding the direct and
immediate impact of dramatic upswings and downswings inherent in the investment markets.
A cost of living adjustment (“COLA”) is set each year at the CPI or an amount up to, but not greater
than, 3% on the first $12,000 of a retiree’s annual payment. COLAs are considered by the Board on an
annual basis. As part of the annual review process, the Board considers the fiscal conditions of the City and
whether the granting of a COLA would substantially impair the City’s funding schedule. COLAs were
approved for each year from fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2009. The funding schedule incorporated a 3%
COLA into its annual appropriation calculation. The Commonwealth, meanwhile, has incorporated in its
pension funding schedule sufficient funds to fulfill its obligation for local COLAs it had awarded prior to
fiscal 1998.

City of Boston Retirement Board.

The SBRS recorded a five-year average annualized return (January 1, 2003 through December 31,
2007) equal to 13.7% and a long term average annualized return (measuring since January 1, 1985) equal to
10.4%. In calendar year 2007 the rate of return for the SBRS equaled 10.4%, and the composite rate of
return for all 106 Massachusetts public pension funds equaled 11.3%. When calendar year 2008 investment
results are finalized, it is expected to reflect an approximately 25% decrease in asset value, similar to
decreases experienced by other Massachusetts public pension systems. This decrease in 2008 will result in
significant decreases in the five year and long-term annualized average rate of returns. This SBRS five year
average annualized rate of return will go below the SBRS’s investment assumption of 8%, however the
long term average annualized return will remain above the SBRS’s investment assumption of 8%.
During 2007, the state passed “An Act to Reduce the Stress on Local Property Taxes through
Enhanced Pension Investment” (Chapter 68 of the Acts of 2007). In accordance with Chapter 68, PERAC
will annually assess investment performance and funded ratio of systems as of January 1st. If a system is:
(i) less than 65% funded, and (ii) has trailed the performance of the Pension Reserve Investment Trust
(“PRIT”) fund by 2% or more on an annualized basis over the previous ten year period, PERAC will
declare the system underperforming and the system shall transfer its assets to the PRIT fund. Such transfer
and control would be permanent.
Currently, the City is the only municipality in the Commonwealth which is responsible for funding its
teachers’ pension liabilities. The City is obligated to annually appropriate amounts for such purpose on an
actuarial cost basis. Investment of teachers’ pension assets is managed by the SBRS. However, the
Commonwealth is obligated to annually reimburse the City for teachers’ pension liabilities on a cost of
benefits basis. Such amounts are deposited in the City’s General Fund. On December 4, 2008, the City, the
SBRS, the Commonwealth and PERAC entered into a Memorandum of Agreement which is intended to
transfer the responsibility for funding Boston teachers’ pension liabilities to the Commonwealth effective
with fiscal year 2010 in order to link investment responsibility with responsibility for pension liability.
Assets held by the SBRS which are allocable to teachers’ pension liabilities will be transferred to the state
Pension Reserves Investment Fund and managed by the state Pension Reserves Investment Management
Board. The SBRS will continue to administer Boston teachers’ pensions and benefits. Full implementation
of the Memorandum of Agreement is contingent upon passage of state legislation.
In addition to SBRS, the Boston Retirement System, the predecessor system, is funded by the City.
This predecessor system has as its members only those active and retired employees whose employment
commenced prior to 1946 and who have not elected coverage under the SBRS program. This system is
funded on a “pay-as-you-go” basis. In addition to SBRS and its predecessor system, the City also provides
noncontributory retirement benefits to certain employees whose employment predates SBRS and its
predecessor system or who are veterans who meet certain state law requirements. The City is currently
providing such benefits to approximately 173 pensioners.
Amounts expended or estimated to be expended by the City for pension and annuities contributions to
SBRS and its predecessor system in the most recent fiscal periods (net of state reimbursements for teacher
retirement costs) are as set forth below.

Other Post Employment Benefits
In addition to the pension benefits described above, the City provides post-employment health care
and life insurance benefits in accordance with state statute to approximately 13,800 participating retirees
and their beneficiaries on a pay-as-you-go basis. Expenditures for such purposes were approximately
$114.9 million in fiscal 2008.
For retirees and their beneficiaries, the City currently pays 75% of Blue Cross/Blue Shield of
Massachusetts premiums and 90% of HMO premiums. In 2007, the City successfully negotiated a decrease
in the employer contribution for HMO premiums with the majority of its active employees, gradually
adjusting to an 85% contribution by 2009. No contribution changes were adopted for Medicare products, in
which the majority of the City’s retirees are enrolled. The City also pays 50% of the premiums for $5,000
of life insurance for each eligible retiree.
GASB Statement No. 43, Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefit Plans Other Than Pension
Plans, and GASB Statement No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for
Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions, became effective June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2008,
respectively. These statements require the City to account for and report the value of its future other postemployment benefit (OPEB) obligations currently rather than on a pay-as-you-go basis. The City received
an independent actuarial valuation of its OPEB obligations as of June 30, 2007. The report estimated that
the City’s portion of the total OPEB actuarial accrued liability as of that date to be between $5.49 billion
(pay-as-you-go) and $3.02 billion (pre-funded), depending on the funding policy elected by the City.
Based on the estimates contained in the actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2007, the City’s portion of
the annual actuarially required contribution to OPEB on account of then current and estimated future
retirees was projected to increase over the ensuing 30 year period to approximately $327.8 million per
annum on a pay-as-you-go basis and that its annual actuarially required contribution would be
approximately $213.4 million per annum under an actuarially pre-funded policy.
In the absence of legal authority to establish a trust fund for the purpose of prefunding OPEB
liabilities in the same manner as traditional pension benefits, the City established an OPEB Stabilization
Fund in the fiscal 2008 Budget for the purpose of paying a portion of these future costs. An appropriation
of $20 million to the OPEB Stabilization Fund was included in the fiscal 2008 Budget. An additional
appropriation of $25 million was included in the fiscal 2009 Budget. In addition, in October 2008, the City
procured investment consulting services in order to optimize investment of the OPEB Stabilization Fund.
Chapter 479 of the Acts of 2008 (“Chapter 479”), effective January 10, 2009, authorizes any city or
town in the Commonwealth accepting its provisions by vote of its governing body to establish a separate
trust fund and to appropriate amounts to the fund in accordance with a schedule developed by an actuary
retained by the city or town and approved by the state actuary in order to reduce the city or town’s
unfunded actuarial OPEB liability and to meet the normal cost of future OPEB benefits. The act designates
the treasurer of the city or town as the custodian of the fund and provides that amounts in the fund shall be
invested by the treasurer consistent with the “prudent investor rule” set forth in state law. As of the date of
this Information Statement the City had not accepted Chapter 479.

Independent Auditors’ Report

The Honorable Mayor and City Council
City of Boston, Massachusetts:
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type
activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate
remaining fund information of the City of Boston (the City), Massachusetts, as of and for the year ended
June 30, 2008, which collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of
contents. These financial statements are the responsibility of the City’s management. Our responsibility is
to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We did not audit the financial
statements of certain entities, which represent 2.5% and 3.4% of the assets and revenues, respectively, of
the aggregate remaining fund information and 25.7% and 24.0% of the assets and revenues, respectively,
of the discretely presented component units. Those financial statements were audited by other auditors
whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion on the financial statements, insofar as it relates to
the aggregate remaining fund information and the discretely presented component units and their effects on
the governmental and fiduciary activities, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards,
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we
express no such opinion. The financial statements of the permanent funds and private-purpose trust funds
were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of
the United States. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit and the reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
In our opinion, based on our audit and the reports of other auditors, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental
activities, the business-type activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major
fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the City of Boston, Massachusetts, as of June 30,
2008, and the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof and the
respective budgetary comparison for the general fund for the year then ended in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As described in notes 12 and 11(h), the City, in 2008, implemented Governmental Accounting Standards
Board (GASB) Statements Nos. 45 and 50, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for
Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions and Pension Disclosures, respectively.

KPMG LLP, a U.S. limited liability partnership, is the U.S.
member firm of KPMG International, a Swiss cooperative.

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated December 15,
2008 on our consideration of the City’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters.
The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting
and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal control over
financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance
with Government Auditing Standards and should be considered in assessing the results of our audit.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 3 through 15 and the schedules of funding progress and
employers’ contributions on page 69 are not a required part of the basic financial statements, but are
supplementary information required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have applied
certain limited procedures which consisted principally of inquiries of management regarding the methods
of measurement and presentation of the required supplementary information. However, we did not audit
the information and express no opinion on it.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
June 30, 2008
(Unaudited)

The City of Boston (the City) provides this Management’s Discussion and Analysis to present additional
information to the readers of the City’s basic financial statements. This narrative overview and analysis of the
financial activities of the City is for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Readers are encouraged to consider this
information in conjunction with the additional information that is furnished in the City’s Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report (CAFR).
Overview of the Financial Statements
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the City’s financial statements. The City’s
basic financial statements include three components: 1) government-wide financial statements, 2) fund financial
statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains required supplementary information
regarding historical pension and other postemployment benefit plan information. These components are
described below:
Basic Financial Statements
The basic financial statements include two types of financial statements that present different views of the City –
the Government-Wide Financial Statements and the Fund Financial Statements. These financial statements also
include the Notes to the Financial Statements that explain some of the information in the financial statements and
provide more detail.
Government-Wide Financial Statements
The Government-Wide Financial Statements provide a broad view of the City’s operations in a manner similar to
a private-sector business. The statements provide both short-term and long-term information about the City’s
financial position, which assist in assessing the City’s economic condition at the end of the fiscal year. These are
prepared using the flow of economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. This
basically means they follow methods that are similar to those used by most businesses. They take into account all
revenues and expenses connected with the fiscal year even if cash involved has not been received or paid. The
government-wide financial statements include two statements:
The Statement of Net Assets presents all of the government’s assets and liabilities, with the difference between
the two reported as “net assets.” Over time, increases or decreases in the City’s net assets may serve as a useful
indicator of whether the financial position of the City is improving or deteriorating.
The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the government’s net assets changed during the
most recent fiscal year. All changes in net assets are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the
change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.
Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will not result in cash flows until
future fiscal periods (such as uncollected taxes and earned but unused vacation leave). This statement also
presents a comparison between direct expenses and program revenues for each function of the City.

(Unaudited)

Both the above financial statements have separate sections for the three different types of city programs or
activities. These three types of activities are:
Governmental Activities – The activities in this section are mostly supported by taxes and intergovernmental
revenues (federal and state grants). Most services normally associated with city government fall into this
category, including general government, human services, public safety, public works, property and development,
parks and recreation, library, schools, county, public health programs, state and district assessments, and debt
service.
Business-Type Activities – These functions normally are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their
costs through user fees and charges to external users of goods and services. These business-type activities of the
City include the activities related to the City’s Convention Center Bond Fund and Hospital Bond Fund.
Discretely Presented Component Units – These are operations for which the City has financial accountability but
function independent of the City of Boston. For the most part, these entities operate similar to private-sector
businesses and the business-type activities described above.
The City’s four discretely presented major component units are:
Boston Public Health Commission
Boston Redevelopment Authority
Economic Development Industrial Corporation
Trustees of the Boston Public Library
Complete financial statements of the individual component units can be obtained from their respective
administrative offices. Additional information about the City’s component units is presented in the notes to the
financial statements.
The government-wide financial statements can be found immediately following this discussion and analysis.
Fund Financial Statements
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated
for specific activities or objectives. The City, like other local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and
demonstrate compliance with finance related legal requirements.

The Fund Financial Statements focus on individual parts of the city government, reporting the City’s operations
in more detail than the government-wide statements. All of the funds of the City can be divided into three
categories. It is important to note that these fund categories use different accounting approaches and should be
interpreted differently. The three categories of funds are:
1.

Governmental Fund Financial Statements – Most of the basic services provided by the City are financed
through governmental funds. Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions
reported as governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. However, unlike the
government-wide financial statements, the governmental fund financial statements focus on near-term
inflows and outflows of spendable resources. They also focus on the balances of spendable resources
available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in evaluating the government’s
near-term financing requirements. This approach is known as using the flow of current financial resources
measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this approach, revenues are
recorded when cash is received or when susceptible to accrual. Expenditures are recorded when liabilities
are incurred and due. These statements provide a detailed short-term view of the City’s finances to assist in
determining whether there will be adequate financial resources available to meet the current needs of the
City.
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial
statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar
information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. By doing
so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing decisions.
Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures,
and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental
funds and the governmental activities. These reconciliations are presented on the page immediately
following each governmental fund financial statement.
The City presents four columns in the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund
statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances. The City’s three major governmental
funds are – the General Fund, the Special Revenue Fund, and the Capital Projects Fund. All nonmajor
governmental funds are combined in the “Other Governmental Funds” column on these statements. The
governmental fund financial statements can be found immediately following the government-wide
statements.
Of the City’s governmental funds, the General Fund is the only fund for which a budget is legally adopted.
The Statement of Revenues and Expenditures – Budgetary Basis is presented on page 24. This Statement
provides a comparison of the original and final budget and the actual expenditures for the current and prior
year.

(Unaudited)

In accordance with state law and regulations, the City’s legally adopted general fund budget is prepared on
a “budgetary” basis instead of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Among the key
differences between these two sets of accounting principles are that “budgetary” records property tax as it
is levied, while GAAP records it as it becomes susceptible to accrual, “budgetary” records certain activities
and transactions in the general fund that GAAP records in separate funds, and “budgetary” records any
amount raised that covers a prior year deficit as an expenditure, and any available funds raised from prior
year surpluses as a revenue, while GAAP ignores these impacts from prior years. The difference in
accounting principles inevitably leads to varying results in excess or deficiency of revenues over
expenditures. Additional information and a reconciliation of “budgetary” to GAAP statements is provided
in note 4 to the financial statements.
2.

Proprietary Funds Financial Statements – These funds are used to show activities that operate more like
those of commercial enterprises. Because these funds charge fees for services provided to outside
customers including local governments, they are known as enterprise funds. Proprietary funds provide the
same type of information as the government-wide financial statements, only in more detail. Like the
government-wide financial statements, proprietary fund financial statements use the accrual basis of
accounting. No reconciliation is needed between the government-wide financial statements for
business-type activities and the proprietary fund financial statements.
The basic proprietary funds financial statements can be found immediately following the governmental
fund financial statements.

3.

Fiduciary Funds Financial Statements – These funds are used to account for resources held for the
benefit of parties outside the City government. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the government-wide
financial statements because the resources of these funds are not available to support the City’s own
programs. The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds. They use
the accrual basis of accounting.
The City’s fiduciary funds are the Employee Retirement Fund (the State-Boston Retirement System),
which accounts for the transactions, assets, liabilities, and net assets of the City employees’ pension plan,
and the Private Purpose Trust Funds, which includes money held and administered by the City on behalf of
third parties.
The fiduciary funds financial statements can be found immediately following the proprietary fund financial
statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements
The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the
Government-Wide and the Fund Financial Statements. The Notes to the Financial Statements can be found
immediately following the Fiduciary Funds Financial Statements.

Required Supplementary Information
The basic financial statements are followed by a section of required supplementary information, which includes a
schedule of funding progress and a schedule of employer contributions for the State-Boston Retirement System
as well as the schedule of funding progress for the City’s other post-employment benefit plan.
Government-Wide Financial Analysis
This analysis is based on the statement of net assets and the statement of activities found on pages 17 through 19
of the financial statements.
Government-Wide Highlights
Net Assets – Primary Government – The total assets of the City exceeded its liabilities at fiscal year ending
June 30, 2008 by $924.3 million (presented as net assets). Of this amount, $354.9 million was reported as
“unrestricted net assets”. Unrestricted net assets represent the amount available to be used to meet the City’s
ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors.
Changes in Net Assets – Primary Government – The City’s total net assets decreased by $164.9 million in fiscal
year 2008. Net assets of governmental activities decreased by $183.9 million, while net assets of the
business-type activities increased by $19.0 million.
Net Assets
As noted earlier, net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government’s financial position. The
City’s combined net assets (governmental and business-type activities) totaled $924.3 million at the end of 2008,
compared to $1.09 billion at the end of the previous year.
The components of net assets are comprised of the following: the investment in capital assets such as land,
buildings, equipment, and infrastructure (road, bridges, and other immovable assets), less any related debt used to
acquire that asset that is still outstanding – this amount is $334.5 million indicating that the net book value of the
City’s capital assets exceeds the amount of capital debt outstanding. The City uses these capital assets to provide
services to citizens; consequentially, these assets are not available for future spending. Although the City’s
investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to
repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to
liquidate these liabilities.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

(Unaudited)

A portion of the City’s governmental activities net assets (25.4%) represents resources that are subject to external
restrictions on how they may be used. The remaining balance of unrestricted net assets may be used to meet the
City’s ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors. Internally imposed designations of resources are not
presented as restricted net assets. Part of the unrestricted net assets (approximately $101.0 million) represents the
receivable from the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) for the reimbursement of bonded school
construction costs. The payments to be received from the MSBA coincide with the City’s future debt service
payments. In fiscal 2009, the amount to be received by the City to pay debt service is approximately
$13.2 million. Although this receivable increases unrestricted net assets, it will not affect the City’s free cash
position.
At the end of the current fiscal year, the City is reporting a positive balance in net assets for the government as a
whole. The negative balance reported for Business-Type activities is offset by the positive balance reported for
Governmental activities. The negative balance in Business-Type activities is a result of special obligation bonds
outstanding at year-end. This deficit is intended to be covered by user charges, grants and lease receipts from
third parties.

Governmental Activities
The City’s governmental activities net assets decreased by $183.9 million over the prior fiscal year. The
following net changes occurred during the course of operations in fiscal 2008: In the assets accounts, cash and
investments increased by $25.3 million, receivables increased by $79.8 million, capital assets increased by
$95.2 million. In the liability accounts, there were increases in warrants payable of $36.8 million, current
long-term debt of $6.9 million, unearned revenue of $36.3 million and accrued liabilities of $17.7 million.
Additionally, a new liability of $212.8 million relative to the City’s other postemployment obligation was booked
in 2008. See page 14 for a more detailed discussion.
During fiscal year 2008, the City’s revenues increased by 1.6%. The City’s largest sources of revenues were
property taxes, excise taxes, and payment in lieu of taxes of $1.47 billion (57.2% of total revenue) and
$792.1 million of program revenues (30.8% of total revenue). The increase in tax revenue was attributed to a
change in property tax commitments and a growth in room occupancy. A rise in state aid was the source for the
increase in grants and contributions not restricted. Investment income and other miscellaneous revenues totaled
$48.6 million down $4.4 million from fiscal year 2007. The primary factor for the decrease in investment income
was lower investment returns.
The increase in revenues allowed for an increase in expense categories. The City’s expenses cover a range of
services. The largest expenses were for schools ($1.27 billion), public safety ($908.4 million), public works
($148.5 million), property and development ($110.3 million), general government ($109.1 million), public health
programs ($68.7 million), and human services ($50.8 million). The primary reason behind the increased expenses
for schools was an increase in salaries. Further, all categories of government experienced an increase in expenses
due to the recognition of the City’s OPEB expense in 2008.
In 2008, governmental activities expenses exceeded program revenues (i.e., user charges, operating grants and
capital grants) by $1.96 billion. This shortfall was covered primarily through taxes ($1.47 billion) and
unrestricted grants and contributions ($259.9 million).
Comparative data on these revenues and expenses is itemized in the reporting of the Changes in Net Assets –
Primary Government on page 9.
Business-Type Activities
Net assets from business-type activities increased $19.0 million during fiscal 2008. This change in net assets
resulted primarily from an increase in excise tax revenues and investment income.
Financial Analysis of the City’s Fund Statements
This analysis is based on the Governmental and Proprietary Fund Financial Statements on pages 20 through 27.
As noted earlier, the City uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal
requirements.

Fund Highlights
Governmental Funds – Fund Balances – As of the close of fiscal year 2008, the City’s governmental funds
reported a combined ending fund balance of $1.04 billion, an increase of $23.0 million from the prior year. Of
this total amount, $586.4 million represents the “unreserved and undesignated fund balances” with
$553.1 million of this amount in the general fund. The increase in fund balance is largely due to an increase in
tax receipts.
Governmental Funds
The focus of the City’s governmental funds is to provide information on near-term inflows, outflows, and
balances of spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the City’s financial requirements. In
particular, unreserved fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government’s financial position at the end
of the fiscal year.
General Fund – Fund Balance – The general fund is the chief operating fund of the City. The City’s General
Fund – Fund Balance Policy states in part to maintain a GAAP undesignated fund balance in the general fund
that is 10%, or higher, of GAAP general fund operating expenditures for the fiscal year. The GAAP undesignated
fund balance at the end of fiscal year 2008 was $553.1 million, which represents approximately 25.3% of GAAP
general fund operating expenditures.
However, because the City is required to follow the statutory basis of accounting rather than GAAP for
determining the amount of undesignated fund balance that can be appropriated, it is the statutory (not the GAAP)
fund balance that is used to calculate “free cash”. Free cash is the amount of statutory fund balance in the general
fund, as certified by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ Department of Revenue, that is available for
appropriation and is generated when actual revenues, on a cash basis, exceeded budgeted amounts and
encumbrances are less than appropriations, or both.
The City of Boston has established the General Fund-Fund Balance Policy to ensure that the City maintains
adequate levels of fund balance to mitigate current and future risks (i.e. revenue shortfalls and unanticipated
expenditures). The policy in full states that the City shall maintain a GAAP undesignated fund balance in the
general fund that is 10% or higher than the current fiscal year’s GAAP general fund operating expenditures; and
that the City shall only consider the certification of free cash (as defined by the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts’ Department of Revenue) in years where the appropriation of free cash shall not cause the fiscal
year’s GAAP undesignated fund balance to go below 10% of the fiscal year’s GAAP general fund expenditures
while maintaining a Budgetary Undesignated Fund Balance between 5% and 10% of Budgetary Operating
Expenses.
The City shall only consider the appropriation of certified free cash to offset: (1) certain fixed costs such as
pension contributions and related post-employment health benefits; and/or (2) to fund extraordinary and
nonrecurring events as determined and certified by the City Auditor.

(Unaudited)

Special Revenue Fund – Fund Balance – The Special Revenue Fund accounts for the proceeds of specific
revenue sources that are legally restricted to expenditures for predefined purposes. The fiscal year 2008 special
revenue fund balance is reported at $190.1 million, a $30.3 million decrease from fiscal year 2007.
Capital Projects Fund – Fund Balance – The Capital Projects Fund accounts for financial resources to be used
for the acquisition or construction of major capital facilities, other than those financed by proprietary funds and
trust funds. The fiscal year 2008 capital projects fund deficit is $1.0 million, a $13.3 million decrease from fiscal
year 2007. The deficit in this fund balance is the result of the $14 million MSBA receivable for the Burke School
and will be eliminated upon reimbursement of construction costs from the MSBA.
Other Governmental Funds – Fund Balance – Other Governmental Funds account for assets held by the City in
permanent trust funds. The fiscal year 2008 other governmental funds fund balance is $44.8 million, a
$3.5 million decrease from fiscal year 2007.
Proprietary Funds
The City’s Proprietary Funds provide the same type of information found in the Government-Wide Financial
Statements for business-type activities. This information is presented on the same basis of accounting, but in
more detail.
The City’s Proprietary Funds net deficit for fiscal year 2008 was $51.0 million. The net deficit in the Proprietary
Funds is a result of the Convention Center special obligation bonds outstanding at year-end.
Budgetary Highlights
The general fund budgetary highlights include ending fiscal year 2008 with a $15.8 million dollar surplus. This
represents the City’s 23rd consecutive year with a balanced budget. Changes to the original budget resulted in an
increase of $9.9 million to the overall budget. These supplemental appropriations were primarily for salaries and
wages within the Boston Public Schools Department. Funding for the supplemental appropriations consisted of
the Retired Teachers Pension payments of $4.7 million and building infrastructure improvements and permits of
$4.6 million. During the year, revenues exceeded budgetary estimates, thus eliminating the need to draw from
existing fund balance. The departmental and other revenue favorable variance of $14.4 million was primarily
comprised of $8.0 million in reimbursements for fringe and pension costs from grants and $2.3 million increase
in Municipal Medicaid reimbursement. The $7.0 million favorable variance in Commonwealth of Massachusetts
was driven by an additional $7.4 million of revenue from the state for Retired Teachers Pension. The “other
available funds” fell short of fiscal year 2008 receipts by $5.0 million due to recording less actual “free cash”
than budgeted. Police and Fire Department overtime expense, exceeding the budget by $16.5 million, was the
main factor in Public Safety’s overspending.
Capital Asset and Debt Administration
Capital Assets
The City’s investment in capital assets for its governmental activities, as of June 30, 2008, has a net book value
of $1.22 billion, made up of costs totaling $2.41 billion less accumulated depreciation of $1.19 billion. This
13

(Unaudited)

investment in capital assets includes land, buildings, improvements, equipment, infrastructure and construction in
progress. Infrastructure assets are items that are normally immovable and have value only to the City, such as
roads, bridges, streets, sidewalks, drainage systems, lighting systems, and similar items.
The total increase in the City’s investment in capital assets for the current fiscal year was approximately 8.5% in
terms of net book value. However, actual expenditures to purchase or construct capital assets were
$158.5 million for the year. Most of this amount was used for the purpose of constructing or reconstructing
buildings and building improvements. Depreciation charges for the year totaled $62.9 million. Additional
information on the City’s capital assets can be found in note 8 of the Notes to Basic Financial Statements.
Long-Term Obligations
Debt Administration – The authority of the City to incur debt is governed by federal and state laws that restrict
the amounts and purposes for which a municipality can incur debt. At year-end, the City had $903.2 million in
General Obligations Bonds principal outstanding – an increase of $42.3 million over last year.
The key factor in this increase was the issuance of the March 1, 2008 Series A and B general obligation and
refunding bonds totaling $154.3 million. Of this amount, $126.2 million (Series A) was new money issued for
the purpose of funding various municipal capital projects and $28.2 million (Series B) was issued for the purpose
of refunding certain outstanding general obligations of the City. The Series A and B bonds were rated AA, Aa1
and AA+ by Fitch, Moody’s and S&P, respectively.
General Obligation Bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the City, including the City’s power to levy
additional taxes to ensure repayment of the debt. Accordingly, all general obligation debt currently outstanding
has been approved by a vote of the City Council.
Notes and Leases Payable and Other Long-Term Obligations – The City’s general long-term notes and leases
and other long-term obligations increased by $240.3 million, or 77.6% during the current fiscal year. The key
factor, for this increase, was the implementation of Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement
No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Post-employment Benefits Other Than Pensions
(OPEB) of $212.8 million. This is the first year the City has recorded this obligation. Additionally, leases
increased by $12.4 million due to the issuance of new equipment leases exceeding lease repayments.
Additional information on the City’s long-term debt obligations can be found in note 10 of the Notes to Basic
Financial Statements.
New Accounting Standards
In 2008, the City implemented Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 45, Accounting
and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions. This standard
requires the City to recognize postemployment benefits, mainly health insurance, when earned rather than on a
pay-as-you-go basis.

In order to comply with this standard, the City hired an actuary to estimate the accrued liability and a required
2008 contribution based on the current level of benefits and an amortization period of 30 years. Based on the
results of that review, the City booked an OPEB expense and an OPEB obligation of $212.8 million.
The City’s 2008 Annual Required Contribution (ARC) was $327.8 million. Contributions against the ARC on a
pay-as-you-go basis totaled $114.9 million and do not include a $21 million transfer to the Health Stabilization
Fund which was created subsequent to year-end. The Health Stabilization Fund was established to manage and
account for the City’s OPEB liability.
The City also implemented GASB Statement No. 50, Pension Disclosures, in 2008. This new standard now
requires entities to report the results of the most recent actuarial valuation in the footnotes. This information was
previously only required to be reported as required supplementary information.
Future Accounting Pronouncements
GASB has issued Statement No. 49, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pollution Remediation Obligation.
This statement is effective date for reporting is June 30, 2009. However, restatement of beginning net assets will
be required if an obligation exists, therefore July 1, 2008 is the more accurate effective date for this statement.
This statement explains when a government would be required to report a liability in its financial statements
related to cleaning up pollution or contamination. GASB 49 also establishes a probability-weighted method that a
government would be required to use to determine the established amount of pollution obligation liabilities to be
reported in its financial statements.

CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
Reconciliation of the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and
Changes in Fund Balance of Governmental Funds to the Statement of Activities
Year ended June 30, 2008
(In thousands)
Net change in fund balances – total governmental funds

$

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of activities are
different because:
Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. In the statement
of activities, the cost of those assets is depreciated over their estimated useful
lives. Capital outlays ($158,485) exceeded depreciation expense ($62,948)
and disposals ($298)
Tax revenues in the statement of activities that are not reported as revenues in the
governmental funds
Proceeds of long-term debt ($181,665) increase long-term liabilities in the
statement of net assets, but are included in the operating statement of the
governmental funds. Repayment of bond, note and lease principal ($97,162) and
payment to the escrow agent ($28,565) are expenditures in the governmental
funds, but reduces long-term liabilities in the statement of net assets. This is the
amount by which proceeds exceed repayments and escrow payments
Bond premiums net ($5,290) increase the long-term liabilities in the statement of
net assets, but are included in the operating statement of the governmental
funds. Deferred losses on refunding ($2,089) decrease long-term liabilities in the
statement of net assets, but are included in the operating statement of the
governmental funds. Bond issuance costs net ($229) are expenditures in the
governmental funds, but are deferred assets in the statement of assets. This is
the amount by which premiums and deferred losses on refundings exceeded
issuance costs
Intergovernmental revenues decrease receivables on the statement of net assets,
but are included in the operating statement of governmental funds
Some expenses reported in the statement of activities do not require the use of
current financial resources and therefore are not reported as expenditures in the
governmental funds. This amount represents the increase in liabilities for
judgments and claims and workers’ compensation($8,632), compensated
absences ($4,842) and other postemployment benefits ($212,823) offset by a
decrease in liabilities for interest payable ($473) and the landfill liability ($262)
Net income from the internal service fund which is presented in the statement
of activities, but not in the governmental funds
Change in net assets of governmental activities

Notes to Basic Financial Statements

The Financial Reporting Entity
The accounting policies followed in preparing the accompanying basic financial statements are as follows:
(a)

Primary Government
The City of Boston (the City), incorporated as a town in 1630 and as a city in 1822, now exists under
Chapter 486 of the Act of 1909 and Chapter 452 of the Acts of 1948 of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts (the Commonwealth) which, as amended, constitute the City’s Charter. The Mayor is
elected to a four-year term and serves as chief executive officer of the City. The Mayor has general
supervision of and control over the City’s boards, commissions, officers, and departments. The
legislative body of the City is the City Council, which consists of thirteen elected members serving
two-year terms.
The accompanying basic financial statements present the City of Boston and its component units.
The component units discussed below are included in the City’s reporting entity because of the
significance of their operational or financial relationships with the City.

(b)

Retirement System
The State-Boston Retirement System (SBRS) is a defined benefit contributory retirement system
created under state statute. It is administered by a Retirement Board comprised of five members: the
City Auditor, who serves ex officio; two individuals elected by participants in the system; a fourth
member appointed by the Mayor; and a fifth member chosen by the other members. The SBRS
provides pension benefits to retired City, Boston Redevelopment Authority, Boston Housing
Authority, Boston Water and Sewer Commission, Boston Public Health Commission and the Sheriff
of Suffolk County employees. Although legally separate, the SBRS provides services entirely, or
almost entirely to the City and thus has been reported as if it were part of the primary government; a
method of inclusion known as blending.
A complete set of financial statements for SBRS for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 can be
obtained through the City Auditor’s office, Room M-4, City Hall Plaza, Boston, Massachusetts
02201. The SBRS is included in the City’s fiduciary fund financial statements.

(c)

Discretely Presented Component Units Disclosure
These component units are reported in a separate column to emphasize that they are legally separate
from the City but are included because the City is financially accountable for and is able to impose
its will on the organizations. Unless otherwise indicated, the notes to the basic financial statements
pertain only to the primary government because certain disclosures of the component units are not
significant relative to the total component units and to the primary government. A description of the
component units, criteria for inclusion, and their relationship with the City are as follows:
Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) – The BRA is a public body politic and corporate
constituting the City’s redevelopment authority and exercising the powers of a planning board
for the City. The BRA is governed by a five-member board, four of whom are appointed by
the Mayor. Its purpose is to provide planning support for major construction and
redevelopment activity in the City.
30

(Continued)

CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2008

Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston (EDIC) – The EDIC is a
body politic and corporate and an instrumentality of the Commonwealth. It is governed by the
same persons appointed as members of the BRA board. The EDIC has various powers to assist
industrial development projects in the City, and together with the BRA, assists the City with its
economic development function.
Boston Public Health Commission (PHC) – The PHC is a body politic and corporate and
public instrumentality of the Commonwealth, established by Chapter 147 of the Acts of 1995.
PHC is governed by a seven-member board, six of whom are appointed by the Mayor and
confirmed by the City Council, and one of whom is the chief executive officer of the Boston
Medical Center (BMC). The PHC is responsible for the implementation of public health
programs in the City.
Trustees of the Public Library of the City of Boston (TPL) – The TPL is a nonprofit
organization qualified as a tax-exempt entity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Trustees of TPL are appointed by the Mayor. The TPL was established to benefit the
public library system of the City.
The financial statements of the discretely presented component units are included for their respective
fiscal year ends, which is June 30, 2008.
Complete financial statements of these discretely presented component units can be obtained through
the City Auditor’s office, Room M-4, City Hall Plaza, Boston, Massachusetts 02201. In addition,
condensed financial statements for the discretely presented component units are included in note 17.
(d)

Related Organizations
The Mayor is also responsible for appointing members of the governing bodies of the Boston
Housing Authority, Boston Industrial Development Finance Authority, and Boston Water and Sewer
Commission; however, the City’s accountability for these organizations does not extend beyond
making these appointments.

(2)

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies of the City of Boston, Massachusetts, conform to U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles as applicable to governmental units as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting
Standards Board (GASB). The following is a summary of the more significant policies followed by the
City:
(a)

Government-Wide and Fund Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net assets and the statement of
changes in net assets) report information on all of the nonfiduciary activities of the primary
government and its component units. For the most part, the effect of interfund activity has been
removed from these statements. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes and
intergovernmental revenues, are reported separately from business-type activities, which rely to a
significant extent on fees and charges for support. Likewise, the primary government is reported
31

(Continued)

CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2008

separately from certain legally separate component units for which the primary government is
financially accountable.
The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function
or segment is offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with
a specific function or segment. Program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants who
purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function or
segment, and 2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital
requirements of a particular function or segment. Taxes and other items not properly included among
program revenues are reported instead as general revenues.
Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary
funds, even though the latter are excluded from the government-wide financial statements. Major
individual governmental funds and major individual enterprise funds are reported as separate
columns in the fund financial statements.
(b)

Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation
Government-Wide Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement
focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the proprietary fund and fiduciary fund financial
statements. The agency fund within the fiduciary fund has no measurement to focus. Revenues are
recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing
of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied.
Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by
the provider have been met.
Amounts reported as program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants for goods,
services, or privileges provided, 2) operating grants and contributions, and 3) capital grants and
contributions, including special assessments. Internally dedicated resources are reported as general
revenues rather than as program revenues. Likewise, general revenues include all taxes.
Governmental Fund Financial Statements
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources
measurements focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon
as they are “susceptible to accrual” (i.e., both measurable and available.) Revenues not considered to
be available are recorded as deferred revenue.
The City applies the susceptible to accrual criteria to property taxes and intergovernmental revenues.
In applying the susceptible to accrual concept to intergovernmental revenues, there are essentially
two types of revenues. In one, resources must be expended on the specific purpose or project before
any amounts will be reimbursed to the City; therefore, revenues are recognized based upon the
amount of expenditures incurred. In the other, resources are virtually unrestricted and are usually
revocable by the grantor only for failure to comply with prescribed compliance requirements. These
resources are reflected as revenues at the time of receipt or earlier if the susceptible to accrual criteria
32

(Continued)

CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2008

are met. Property taxes are recognized as revenue in the year for which taxes have been levied,
provided they are collected within 60 days after year end.
Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred. However, debt service expenditures,
as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and judgments and claims, are recorded
only when payment is mature and due.
Proprietary Fund, Fiduciary Fund, and Component Unit Financial Statements
Private-sector standards of accounting and financial reporting issued prior to December 1, 1989
generally are followed in both the government-wide and proprietary fund financial statements to the
extent that those standards do not conflict with or contradict guidance of GASB. Governments also
have the option of following subsequent private-sector guidance for their business-type activities and
enterprise funds, subject to this same limitation. The City has elected not to follow subsequent
private-sector guidance.
Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from nonoperating items. Operating
revenues and expenses generally result from the collection of revenue pledged to repay debt. The
principal operating revenues of the City’s enterprise funds are lease receipts and excise taxes. The
principal operating revenues of the City’s internal service funds are receipts from employer and
employee premiums for health insurance premiums. Operating expenses for enterprise funds and
internal service funds include the interest, administrative expenses, and vendor payments. All
revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as nonoperating revenues and
expenses.
Governmental funds – The City reports the following major governmental funds:
The general fund is the City’s primary operating fund. It accounts for all financial resources of
the general government, except those required to be accounted for in another fund.
The special revenue fund accounts principally for the activities funded by federal and state
grant revenue sources and certain other revenues that are legally restricted to expenditures for
specified purposes.
The capital activities fund accounts for bond proceeds and grant revenues used for the
acquisition or construction of the City capital facilities.
Proprietary funds – The City reports the following major proprietary funds:
The convention center bond fund accounts for the City activities related to the financing for the
construction of a new state-owned convention center. Revenue debt issued in connection with
this fund is payable solely by specified local and state receipts.
The hospital revenue bond fund accounts for the activities related to the Boston City Hospital
Revenue Bonds. These Bonds are payable solely from the mortgage note payments received
from the Public Health Commission. These Bonds are repaid from a pledged revenue source
from PHC.
33

(Continued)

CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2008

Fiduciary funds – Additionally, the City reports the following fiduciary fund types:
The private-purpose trust fund is used to account for resources legally held in trust for the
benefit of individuals, private organizations, or other governments. The City operates four
pools used for the improvement of the City’s parks and cemeteries, educational scholarships
and sporting equipment, creation of public utility and beauty and co-mingled nontestamentary
trusts.
The pension trust fund accounts principally for the activities of the State-Boston Employees
Retirement System, a blended component unit, which accumulates resources for pension
benefit payments to retired City employees.
The agency funds are used to report funds held by the City in a purely custodial capacity. The
City currently operates a drug evidence account for proceeds from property seized from illegal
drug related activities. These funds are then used to offset the costs of technical equipment or
expertise and investigations.
The City also uses an internal service fund to account for its self-insured health costs. Although the
fund is presented in a separate column in the accompanying basic financial statements, it is not
considered a major fund.
As a general rule, the effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the government-wide
financial statements.
When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the City’s policy to use
restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are needed.
(c)

Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, investments with original maturities of three months or
less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.

(d)

Basis of Investment Valuation
Investments are presented in the accompanying basic financial statements at fair value. Where
applicable, fair values are based on quotations from national securities exchanges, except for certain
investments of SBRS which are described in notes 5 and 11. Further, income from investments is
recognized in the same fund as the related investments.
The City invests in the Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust (MMDT), which is an external
investment pool and is not SEC registered. The fund is state regulated and is valued at current share
price.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2008

(e)

Interfund Receivables and Payables
Activity between funds that are representative of lending/borrowing arrangements outstanding at the
end of the fiscal year are referred to as either “due to/from other funds” (i.e., the current portion of
interfund loans) or “advances to/from other funds” (i.e., the noncurrent portion of interfund loans).
All other outstanding balances between funds are reported as “due to/from other funds.” Any
residual balances outstanding between the governmental activities and business-type activities are
reported in the government-wide financial statements as “internal balances.”
Advances between funds, as reported in the fund financial statements, are offset by a fund balance
reserve account in applicable governmental funds to indicate that they are not available for
appropriation and are not expendable available financial resources.

(f)

Uncollectible Tax and Other Receivables
All receivables are shown net of an allowance for uncollectibles. Amounts considered to be
uncollectible are based on the type and age of the related receivable.

(g)

Capital Assets
Capital assets, which include property, plant, equipment and infrastructure assets (e.g., roads,
bridges, sidewalks, and similar items) are reported in the applicable governmental or business-type
activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. Capital assets are defined by the
City as assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $15,000 and an estimated useful life in
excess of two years. Such assets are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical cost if
purchased or constructed. Donated capital assets are recorded at estimated fair market value at the
date of donation. Any significant construction commitments are encumbered at year-end in the
City’s Capital Project Fund.
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially
extend assets’ lives are not capitalized.
Property, plant, and equipment of the primary government, as well as the component units, are
depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Assets
Buildings
Building improvements
Infrastructure
Land improvements – major
Land improvements – playgrounds
Computer upgrades
Equipment and machinery
Computers and related equipment
Furniture and fixtures
Motor vehicles

Compensated Absences

Employees are granted sick and vacation leave in varying amounts. Upon retirement, termination, or
death, certain employees are compensated for unused sick and vacation leave (subject to certain
limitations) at their then current rates of pay. The portion of the liability related to unused sick and
vacation time that has matured or is due as of June 30, 2008 is recorded in the governmental fund
financial statements. The liability for vacation leave is based on the amount earned but not used; for
sick leave, it is based on the amount accumulated at the balance sheet date (vesting method). The
liability for both amounts is calculated based on the pay or salary rates in effect at the balance sheet
date.
(i)

Long-Term Obligations and Related Costs

Premiums, Discounts, and Issue Costs – In the government-wide financial statements, and
proprietary fund types in the fund financial statements, long-term debt and other long-term
obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable governmental activities, business-type
activities, or proprietary fund type statement of net assets. Bond premiums and discounts, as well as
issuance costs, are deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds using the effective interest
method. The unamortized portion is presented in the government-wide statement of net assets. Bonds
payable are reported net of the applicable bond premium or discount. Bond issuance costs are
reported as deferred charges and amortized over the term of the related debt.
In the fund financial statements, governmental fund types recognize bond premiums and discounts,
as well as bond issuance costs, during the current period. The face amount of debt issued is reported
as other financing sources. Premiums received on debt issuances are reported as other financing
sources while discounts on debt issuances are reported as other financing uses. Issuance costs,
whether or not withheld from the actual debt proceeds received, are reported as debt service
expenditures.
(j)

Fund Equity

In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report reservations of fund balance for amounts
that are not available for appropriation or are legally restricted by outside parties for use for a
specific purpose. Designations of fund balance represent tentative management plans that are subject
to change.
(k)

Tax Abatement Refunds

Matured tax abatement refunds that are due and payable at June 30 have been recorded as a liability
in the general fund. Other refunds have been recorded in the government-wide statement of net
assets.

Landfill Closure and Postclosure Care Costs

State and federal regulations require the City to place a final cover on its Gardner Street landfill site
when it stops accepting waste and to perform certain maintenance and monitoring functions at the
site for 30 years after closure. At June 30, 2008, 100% of the Gardner Street landfill site had been
used and had not accepted solid waste for several years. While most of the landfill closure
construction was completed in prior years, there still remains 12 acres of the landfill to be capped as
of June 30, 2008.
The total current cost of landfill closure and postclosure care is an estimate, subject to changes
resulting from inflation, deflation, technology or other changes in applicable laws or regulations.
Such costs are recognized as expenditures in the general fund to the extent that they are due or
matured and are expected to be paid with expendable available financial resources. The total liability
is reported in the government-wide statement of net assets. Expenditures related to the Gardner
Street landfill site postclosure care in fiscal year 2008 were approximately $263,000.
(m)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the accompanying basic financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
(3)

Short-Term Debt
During fiscal year 2008, the City had no short-term debt issued or outstanding.

(4)

Budgetary Data
The general fund is the only fund for which a budget is legally adopted. The budgets for all departments
included in the general fund of the City, except the School Department, are prepared under the direction of
the Mayor and City Council. The School Department budget is prepared under the direction of the School
Committee.
Original and supplemental appropriations are submitted by the Mayor, approved by the City Council and
lapse at year-end unless encumbered. The legal level of control over appropriations is at the department
level. Amendments to the original budget must be approved by the City Council, except for a reallocation
of appropriations of up to $3 million, which the Mayor may approve. Further, the City Auditor, with the
approval of the Mayor, may make transfers from any appropriation to any other appropriation for purposes
of eliminating deficits before closing the books for the fiscal year. After the close of the fiscal year, the
City Auditor may, with the approval of the Mayor, apply any income, taxes, and funds not disposed of and
make transfers from any appropriation to any other appropriation for the purpose of closing the accounts
for the fiscal year. Supplemental appropriations, other than the aforementioned transfers, were $9.9 million
for the year.

37

(Continued)

CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2008

The City must establish its property tax rate each year so that the resulting property tax levy will comply
with the limits required by Proposition 2-1/2 (note 6). The tax levy must equal the sum of (a) the aggregate
of all annual appropriations for expenditures; plus (b) the reserve accounts described in the following
paragraph; plus (c) provision for the prior fiscal years’ deficits, if any; less (d) the aggregate of all
nonproperty tax revenues projected to be received by the City, including available funds, in amounts
certified or approved by the Commonwealth for tax rate purposes.
In accordance with the 1986 amendments to the Funding Loan Act of 1982, the City has established two
reserve funds. The first is a budget reserve fund which is required to be funded in stages to a final level of
2-1/2% of the prior year’s overall departmental appropriations, except the School Department, by the
beginning of fiscal year 1990. It is available to be applied to extraordinary and unforeseen expenditures.
The second is a separate reserve fund of 1% to 2-1/2% of the current year appropriation of the School
Department to be applied to over expenditures in that department.
The City’s general fund budget is prepared on a basis other than accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (GAAP). The “actual” results column in the statement of revenues and
expenditures – budgetary basis – general fund is presented on a “budgetary basis” to provide a meaningful
comparison of actual results with the budget. The major differences between the budget and GAAP basis,
where applicable, are that:
(a)

Revenues are recorded when cash is received, except for real estate and personal property taxes
which are recorded as revenue when levied (budget), as opposed to when susceptible to accrual
(GAAP).

(b)

Encumbrances and continuing appropriations are recorded as the equivalent of expenditures
(budget), as opposed to a reservation of fund balance (GAAP).

(c)

Certain activities and transactions are presented in separate funds (GAAP), rather than as
components of the general fund (budget).

(d)

Amounts raised for the prior years’ deficits and available funds from prior years’ surpluses are
recorded as revenue items (budget), but have no effect on GAAP revenues.

In addition, there are certain differences in classifications between revenues, expenditures, and transfers.

Deposits and Investments

State and local statutes place certain limitations on the nature of deposits and investments available to the
City. Deposits, including demand deposits, money markets and certificates of deposit in any one financial
institution, may not exceed 60% of the capital and surplus of such institution unless collateralized by the
financial institution involved. Investments may be made in unconditionally guaranteed U.S. Government
obligations having maturities of a year or less from the date of purchase, or through repurchase agreements
with maturities of no greater than 90 days in which the underlying securities consist of such obligations.
Other allowable investments include authorized bonds of all states, bankers’ acceptances, commercial
paper rated within the three highest classifications established by rating agencies, and units in the MMDT.
The highest classifications for Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch are as follows:

The City and its blended component unit apply GASB No. 40, Deposit and Investment Risk Disclosures.
The standard requires that entities disclose essential risk information about deposits and investments.
Primary Government (except the pension trust fund)
(a)

Custodial Credit Risk

Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of bank failure, the City’s deposits may not be
returned. The City carries deposits that are fully insured by FDIC insurance, collateralized and
deposits that are not collateralized and are uninsured. As of June 30, 2008, the bank balances of
uninsured and uncollateralized deposits totaled approximately $4.3 million. All of the City’s
investments are held by third parties in the City’s name.
(b)

Investment Policy

The City’s primary concern in connection with its investment activities is a concern shared by all
municipal governments: the preservation of capital. The City’s investment policy establishes a
domain in which all of the City’s investment activities may be safely conducted while it strives to
use its capital resources as efficiently as possible. The frontiers of that domain are fixed by
Massachusetts General Laws M.G.L. c. 44, sec. 55, which prohibits Massachusetts communities

Concentration Risk

The City adheres to the provisions of M.G.L. c. 44, sec. 55 when managing concentration risk.
M.G.L. c. 44, sec. 55 contains several restrictions limiting where and under what circumstances the
City may deposit its funds. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 44, sec. 55, cities and towns in the Commonwealth
may deposit available fund balances in banks, trust companies, or banking companies, provided that
the amounts deposited do not exceed 60% of the capital and surplus of an institution unless
satisfactory security for the amount in excess of 60% is provided by the depository.
State-Boston Retirement System (SBRS or the System)
(a)

Custodial Credit Risk

Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of bank failure, the System’s deposits may not be
returned. The System carries deposits that are fully insured by FDIC insurance or collateralized with
securities held by the System or the System’s agent in the System’s name. The System also carries
deposits that are not collateralized and are uninsured. As of December 31, 2007, all of the System’s
deposits were insured or collateralized.
(b)

Investment Policy

The provisions of M.G.L. c. 32, sec 23(2) govern the System’s investment practice.
Diversification is attained through varied investment management styles that comply with
Massachusetts state law. This is accomplished through the retention of investment managers that
adhere to M.G.L. c. 32, sec. 23(3), the “Prudent Person” rule.
The System has retained an investment consultant to work with the Retirement Board in a fiduciary
capacity to assure that strategic investment diversification is attained, to employ investment
managers with expertise in their respective asset classes, and to closely monitor the implementation
and performance of the respective investment strategies.
The System is currently invested in stocks (domestic and foreign), fixed income securities (domestic
and foreign), real estate, private equity, and hedge funds.

The System’s guidelines do not specifically address limits on maturities as a means of managing its
exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. The manager of each fixed
income portfolio is responsible for determining the maturity and commensurate returns of their
portfolio.
The collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) held by the System as of December 31, 2007 are
highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.
(d)

Credit Risk

The System allows investment managers to apply discretion under the “Prudent Person” rule.
Investments are made, as a prudent person would be expected to act with discretion and intelligence,
to seek reasonable income, preserve capital and, in general, avoid speculative investments.

Property Taxes

Real and personal property taxes are based on values assessed as of each January 1. By law, all taxable
property must be assessed at 100% of fair cash value. Also by law, property taxes must be levied at least
30 days prior to their due date. Once levied, these taxes are recorded as receivables, net of estimated
uncollectible balances. Property tax revenues have been recorded using the modified accrual basis of
accounting, described in note 2.
The City bills and collects its property taxes on a quarterly basis following the January 1 assessment. The
due dates for those quarterly tax billings are August 1, November 1, February 1, and May 1. Property taxes
that remain unpaid after the respective due dates are subject to penalties and interest charges.
Based on the City’s experience, most property taxes are collected during the year in which they are
assessed. Liening of properties on which taxes remain unpaid occurs annually. On December 11, 2007, all
properties with unpaid fiscal year 2007 property taxes were liened. The City ultimately has the right to
foreclose on all properties where the taxes remain unpaid.

CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS

Notes to Basic Financial Statements

A statewide property tax limitation known as “Proposition 2-1/2” limits the amount of increase in the
property tax levy in any fiscal year. Generally, Proposition 2-1/2 limits the total levy to an amount not
greater than 2-1/2% of the total assessed value of all taxable property within the City. Secondly, the tax
levy cannot increase by more than 2-1/2% of the prior year’s levy plus the taxes on property newly added
to the tax rolls. Certain provisions of Proposition 2-1/2 can be overridden by a City-wide referendum.

The City participates in the Commonwealth’s school building assistance program, which is
administered by the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA). The MSBA provides

Notes Receivable

Section 108 is the loan guarantee provision of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
program. Section 108 provides communities with a source of financing for economic development,
housing rehabilitation, public facilities, and large-scale physical development projects. Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) provides grants to local governments, which in turn provides loans to
developers. As of June 30, 2008, under this program, the City determined that $58.9 million was
collectible.
Governmental funds report deferred revenue in connection with receivables for revenues that are not
considered to be available to liquidate liabilities of the current period. Governmental funds also defer
revenue recognition in connection with resources that have been received, but not yet earned. At the
end of the current fiscal year, the various components of deferred revenue and unearned revenue
reported in the governmental funds were as follows (in thousands):

On March 1, 2008, the City issued $154,340,000 of general obligation and refunding bonds, $126,185,000
for various municipal capital projects, and $28,155,000 for the purpose of refunding certain outstanding
general obligation bonds of the City totaling $28.6 million. Interest on the bonds are payable semiannually
each March 1, and September 1, until maturity in fiscal years 2028 and 2015, respectively. The cash flow
difference and economic gain (the difference between the present values of the debt service payments on
old and new debt) obtained from the refunding were $2,586,375 and $2,229,798, respectively.
No Obligation Debt

The City has outstanding industrial, commercial, and housing development bonds payable solely from
revenues of the respective enterprises that do not constitute an indebtedness of the City and are not a
charge against its general credit. This aggregate amount is immaterial to the financial statements.
The City is subject to a dual general debt limit: the normal debt limit and the double debt limit. Such limits
are equal to 5% and 10%, respectively, of the valuation of taxable property in the City as last equalized by
the State Department of Revenue. Debt may be authorized up to the normal debt limit without state
approval. Authorizations under the double debt limit, however, require the approval of the
Commonwealth’s Emergency Finance Board. Additionally, there are many categories of general obligation
debt which are exempt from the debt limit but are subject to other limitations.
As of June 30, 2008, the City may issue $3.2 billion of additional general obligation debt under the debt
limit. General obligation debt of $477.3 million, subject to the debt limit, and $88.1 million, exempt from
the debt limit, are authorized but unissued as of June 30, 2008.

The revenue refunding bonds of the Boston City Hospital (BCH) do not constitute general obligations of
the City and the annual debt service of these bonds has been assumed by the Boston Public Health
Commission. The Boston Public Health Commission expects to meet its obligation on the bonds through
application of a portion of the rent payable to the Boston Public Health Commission by the Boston Medical
Center Corporation (BMC) for its lease of the former Boston City Hospital. Under certain circumstances,
including a default by BMC under the lease, City revenues may be required to satisfy the debt service
requirements on the Series B bonds.

Plan Description

The City contributes to the SBRS, a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan.
The System provides retirement, disability and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries of
the following government units:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)

City of Boston
Boston Redevelopment Authority
Boston Housing Authority
Boston Water and Sewer Commission
Boston Public Health Commission
Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department

Chapter 32 of the MGL assigns authority to establish and amend benefit provisions of the plan to the
state legislature.
The System is administered by a five-person Board of Retirement consisting of the City Auditor,
who serves as a member ex officio, two members who are elected by the participants, in or retired
from the service of the System, a fourth member appointed by the Mayor, and a fifth member chosen
by the other members.
(b)

Basis of Accounting

The System’s financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Plan member
contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are due. Employer contributions
to the plan are recognized when due and the employer has made a formal commitment to provide the
contributions. Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the
terms of each plan.
Investments of the System are stated as follows:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)

Contributions

Plan members are required to contribute to the System. Depending on their employment date, active
members must contribute a range of 5% – 9% of their regular gross compensation. Members hired
after December 31, 1978 must contribute an additional 2% of regular compensation in excess of
$30,000. Participating employers are required to pay into the System their share of the remaining
system-wide actuarially determined contribution, which is apportioned among the employers based
on active covered payroll. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the Commonwealth) reimburses
the City for benefits paid to school teachers. The Commonwealth also reimbursed the System for a
portion of benefit payments for cost of living increases granted before July 1, 1998. The
contributions of plan members and the participating employers are governed by Chapter 32 of the
MGL. The City’s required and actual contributions to the System for the years ended June 30, 2008,
2007 and 2006 were $203 million, $193 million, $186 million, or $105 million, or $99 million, and
$101 million, net of teachers’ retirement, respectively.
During the fall of 1997, the System’s Retirement Board, the City Council, and the Mayor approved
the option for local funding of cost of living adjustments. As a result, a locally funded cost of living
adjustment of 3.0% on the first $12,000 of a retiree’s annual payment was awarded in fiscal year
2001 and each year following. These cost of living adjustments will be awarded by the Retirement
Board each year, except in years in which the Retirement Board determines that such an adjustment
would substantially impair the funding schedule.

Securities Lending

The Public Employment Retirement Administration Commission of Massachusetts (PERAC) has
issued supplemental regulations that permit the System to engage in securities lending transactions.
These transactions are conducted by the System’s custodian, which lends certain securities owned by
the System to other broker-dealers and banks pursuant to a form of loan agreement. The System and
the borrowers maintain the right to terminate all securities lending transactions on demand.
At the System’s direction, the custodian lends the System’s securities and receives cash (including
both United States and foreign currency), United States government securities, sovereign debt of
foreign countries, and irrevocable bank letters of credit as collateral. The custodian does not have the
ability to pledge or sell collateral unless the borrower defaults. Borrowers are required to deliver
cash collateral in amounts equal to not less than 100% of the market value of the loaned securities.
The System does not impose any restrictions on the amount of securities lent on its behalf by the
custodian. There were no failures by any borrowers to return loaned securities or pay distributions
thereon, and there were no losses from a default of the borrowers or the custodian for the year ended
December 31, 2007. The cash collateral received by the custodian on each loan was invested,
together with the cash collateral of other qualified tax-exempt plan lenders, in a collective investment
pool. The relationship between the average maturities of the investment pool and loans was affected
by the maturities of the loans made by other plans that invested cash collateral in the collective
investment pool, which the System could not determine. At December 31, 2007, the System had no
credit risk exposure to borrowers because the amounts the System owed the borrowers exceeded the
amounts owed to the System. Borrower rebates and fees paid to the custodian during the year ended
December 31, 2007 was $1.3 million.

Funded Status and Funding Progress

In 2007 and 2008, the System and the City, respectively, adopted GASB Statement No. 50, Pension
Disclosures. This new standard now requires entities to report the results of the most recent actuarial
valuation in the footnotes. This information was previously only required to be reported as required
supplementary information.
The funded status of the System as of January 1, 2007, the most recent actuarial valuation date, is as
follows (in thousands):

Actuarially accrued liability (AAL)
Actuarial value of plan assets
Unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL)

$

UAAL as a percentage of covered payroll

1,221,404
170.7%

In the January 1, 2007 actuarial valuation, the individual entry age normal actuarial cost method was
used. The actuarial assumptions included an 8.0% investment rate of return, projected salary
increases of 5.0%, and cost-of-living adjustments of 3% up to $360 annually. The actuarial value of
assets was determined using the fair value of investments. The System’s unfunded actuarial accrued
liability is being amortized as a level percentage of pay on an open basis. The remaining
amortization period at January 1, 2007 was 16 years.

(12) Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB)
GASB Statement No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits
Other Than Pensions, is required to be implemented by governments with annual revenues greater than
$100 million for financial statement periods beginning after December 15, 2006. Statement No. 45 requires
governments to account for other postemployment benefits, primarily healthcare, on an accrual basis rather
than on a pay-as-you-go basis. The effect is the recognition of an actuarially required contribution as an
expense on the government-wide statement of activities when a future retiree earns their postemployment
59

Notes to Basic Financial Statements

benefit rather than when they use their postemployment benefit. To the extent that an entity does not fund
their actuarially required contribution, a postemployment benefit liability is recognized on the
government-wide statement of net assets over time.
In addition to the pension benefits described in note 11, the City provides postemployment health care and
life insurance benefits, in accordance with state statute and City ordinance, to participating retirees and
their beneficiaries. Participating retirees are City of Boston retirees. As of June 30, 2007, the valuation
date, approximately 14,000 retirees and 16,000 active members meet the eligibility requirements as put
forth in Chapter 32B of MGL. The City sponsors and participates in an agent multi-employer defined
benefit OPEB plan. The OPEB plan is administered by the City and does not issue a stand-alone financial
report. GASB Statement No. 43 requires the City to report their OPEB plan as an agency fund in their
fiduciary financial statements. However, the City has determined that activity in this fund is immaterial to
the City’s financial statements and does not present the fund within the fiduciary financial statements.
Medical and prescription drug benefits are provided to all eligible retirees not enrolled in Medicare through
a variety of plans offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, and
Neighborhood Health Plan. Medical and prescription drug benefits are provided to retirees enrolled in
Medicare through supplemental and Medicare Advantage plans offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, and Tufts Health Plan.
Groups 1 and 2 retirees, including teachers, with at least 10 years or 20 years of creditable service are
eligible at age 55 or any age, respectively. Group 4 retirees with at least 10 years or 20 years of creditable
service are eligible at age 45 or any age, respectively. Retirees on accidental disability retirement are
eligible at any age while ordinary disability requires 10 years of creditable service. The surviving spouse is
eligible to receive both pre- and post-retirement death benefits, as well as medical and prescription drug
coverage.

Funding Policy

Employer and employee contribution rates are governed by the respective collective bargaining
agreements. The City currently funds the plan on a pay-as-you-go basis. The City and plan members
share the cost of benefits. As of June 30, 2007, the valuation date, the plan members contribute 10%
to 25% of the monthly premium cost, depending on the plan in which they are enrolled. The City
contributes the balance of the premium cost.

Annual OPEB Cost and Net OPEB Obligation

The City’s annual OPEB expense is calculated based on the annual required contribution of the
employer (ARC), an amount actuarially determined in accordance with the parameters of
GASB Statement No. 45. The ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is
projected to cover the normal cost each year and amortize any unfunded actuarial liability over a
period of thirty years. The following table shows the components of the City’s annual OPEB cost for
the year ending June 30, 2008, the amount actually contributed to the plan, and the change in the
City’s net OPEB obligation based on an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2007 (in thousands):

CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
Notes to Basic Financial Statements
June 30, 2008

Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and
assumptions about the probability of occurrence of events far into the future. Examples include
assumptions about future employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts determined
regarding the funded status of the plan and the annual required contributions of the City are subject
to continual revision as actual results are compared with past expectations and new estimates are
made about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as required supplementary
information following the notes to the financial statements, presents multi-year trend information
that shows whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to
the actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits.
(d)

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions

Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the substantive plan (the plan as
understood by the City and plan members) and include the types of benefits provided at the time of
each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing of benefit costs between the City and plan
members to that point. The actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are
designed to reduce short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of
assets, consistent with the long-term perspective of the calculations.
In the June 30, 2007 actuarial valuation, the projected unit credit cost method was used. The actuarial
assumptions included a 4.5% investment rate of return and an annual health care cost trend rate of
10% – 11% initially, reduced by decrements to an ultimate rate of 5% after 5 – 6 years. The health
care cost trend rate differs between the master medical and other healthcare plans. The actuarial
value of assets was determined using the market value of investments. The City’s unfunded actuarial
accrued liability is being amortized as a level percentage of pay on a closed basis. The remaining
amortization period at July 1, 2007 was thirty years.

The excess expenditures reported above are allowed under the budgetary laws governing the City.

(15) Public Health System
Effective July 1, 1996, the City’s Department of Health and Hospitals and Trustees of Health and
Hospitals, were abolished. Substantially all their assets and liabilities, including title to the City’s two
hospitals, Boston City Hospital (BCH) and Boston Specialty and Rehabilitation Hospital (BSRH), were
transferred to and assumed by the Boston Public Health Commission (PHC).
Also effective July 1, 1996, the operations of BCH and BSRH were consolidated with the operations of the
Boston University Medical Center under the licensure and control of the Boston Medical Center
Corporation (BMC).
The PHC receives the majority of its funding from Federal and state grants, lease agreements with BMC
and a City appropriation. During fiscal year 2008, the City appropriated $68.2 million to the PHC. As
described below, the PHC uses the appropriation to pay debt service on certain general obligation bonds
and base assistance grant payments to BMC. The remainder of the appropriation is used for administrative
purposes and to support the various public health programs run by the PHC. The City has budgeted
$69.4 million for the PHC for fiscal year 2009.
Due from PHC/BMC

On July 1, 1996, in connection with the consolidation transaction described above, the PHC assumed a
liability of $149.8 million for a mortgage note due to the City. In August 2002, this note was refinanced
such that the stream of payments made by the PHC on the new note will be used to pay the outstanding
balance of $122.9 million of the City’s Special Obligation Refunding Bonds dated August 2002. The PHC
receives funding for the note payments from the BMC under a lease agreement whereby the BMC leases
portions of the former BCH for an initial period of 50 years. Rental payments received under this lease are
equal to the debt service costs on the new note and on all City general obligation bonds allocable to BCH.
These general obligation bonds were issued by the City between December 1967 and October 1995 and
total $7.0 million at June 30, 2008. These bonds pertain to the property and operations of the BCH

Campus, South Block Campus, BSRH Campus, Emergency Medical Services Operations, and the Long
Island Campus.
In addition, the PHC and BMC are also responsible for reimbursing the City for health insurance,
equipment lease payments, workers’ compensation, and other miscellaneous expenses paid for by the City.
Payments to BMC

PHC is obligated to make future base assistance grant payments to BMC of $10.8 million each year
through fiscal year 2019.

(16) Risk Management
The City is self insured for general liability, property, and casualty (except for boiler and machinery losses
up to $10.0 million), worker injury, unemployment, and certain employee health claims. The City’s
Corporation Counsel defends the City in any lawsuits that arise from the normal course of operations, with
exposure limited by a state tort cap under Chapter 258 of the MGL. Except for certain health care costs
described below, judgments and claims are charged to the general fund.
The City’s health insurance program, administered by the Health Insurance and Benefits Division, a
program within Human Resources, provides coverage to the City’s employees and retirees through a
number of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) and Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Massachusetts
(BC/BS). Costs to the City for the HMOs, which varies from 90%-82.5% of total premium after employee
contributions, are accounted for in the general fund and are capped at a defined premium payment per
employee.
BC/BS acts as a third-party agent for the City in the payment of the various claim plans used by the City.
City costs incurred for the operation of the BC/BS plans, totaling 75% of premium after employee
contributions, are accounted for in a separate health insurance internal service fund.
The City has implemented a comprehensive risk financing strategy that includes establishing a catastrophic
risk reserve, currently with a $12.2 million balance available for future losses. The City’s property
insurance was renewed – a one-year, all-risk catastrophic property insurance policy covering all City
property assets up to $100.0 million, after a $10.0 million retention. Any boiler and machinery-related
property loss is additionally insured, after a $50,000 deductible, for up to $10.0 million.

The City has established a liability based on historical trends of previous years and attorney’s estimates of
pending matters and lawsuits in which the City is involved. Changes in the self-insurance liability for the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 are as follows (in thousands):

The liabilities above have not been discounted to their present value. Incurred claims represent the total of
a provision for events of the current fiscal year and any change in the provision for events of the prior
fiscal years.
There are numerous pending matters and lawsuits in which the City is involved. The City attorneys
estimate that the potential claims against the City not recorded in the accompanying basic financial
statements resulting from such litigation would not materially affect the basic financial statements.

THE BOSTON ECONOMY
The City is the twenty-first largest city in the United States and the economic hub of The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Commonwealth”) and the New England region. It is a center for
professional, business, financial, governmental, higher educational and medical services, as well as for
transportation, communications, export, cultural and entertainment activities. As a government center, the
City is the capital of the Commonwealth and is host to several federal regional offices. High technology,
research and development, financial services, manufacturing, and wholesale distribution also contribute to
the economy of the City and its suburbs.
In 2007 the City had a population of 608,352, as estimated by the U.S. Department of Commerce
Bureau of the Census (the “Bureau of the Census”), and had 675,624 jobs, as stated in a series for Boston
consistent with the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (the “Bureau of
Economic Analysis”) for Suffolk County pro-rated for Boston (employment in 2008 is estimated at
682,375). The ratio of jobs to population indicates that the City provides a direct source of employment and
income for an area that extends well beyond its borders. Measured in terms of jobs, the City’s economy
comprises approximately 18% of the Massachusetts economy and 7% of that of the six New England states.
Overview of Recent Economic Conditions
The City of Boston’s economy had experienced moderate growth from 2004 through much of 2008
particularly its labor market, whereby roughly 44,000 jobs were added during the time period. Beginning in
the final few months of 2008, however, the City began to experience rising unemployment and much of the
same deteriorating economic conditions as the U.S. as a whole. As the national economy began to
experience rising unemployment and more rapidly deteriorating economic conditions beginning in the
spring 2008, Boston continued to add jobs at a moderate pace. It wasn’t until November 2008 that Boston
began to show signs of a weakening labor market and the same deteriorating conditions then prevalent in
the rest of the country. Up to the present, however, conditions remain worse at the national level than in
Boston; the U.S. unemployment rate is higher than Boston’s, the nation’s level of job loss has been greater,
and although Boston’s real estate markets have been experiencing rising vacancy rates and a correction in
prices for several months, it is still outperforming most other major real estate markets in the U.S.
Unemployment rates, which had been as low as 3.9% as recently as the final months of 2007 in the
City reached 6.0% in December 2008. The national unemployment rate, which was in the 4.3% to 5.0%
range throughout 2007, reached 7.1% in December 2008. Massachusetts and New England also had higher
unemployment rates than the City of Boston: 6.5% and 6.6% respectively, in December 2008. Boston’s
office market, which strengthened from 2005 through 2007 with lower vacancy rates, less available space,
and positive absorption experienced a downward shift during the last two quarters of 2008. Similarly,
hotels after several years of improving performance have also shown declines; the hotel occupancy rate
went from 69.6% in 2001 to 76.1% in 2007, but then fell to 75.1% in 2008. The housing market, hurt by
rising foreclosures and the tight lending market, has experienced weakened sales volumes and small to
moderate drops in prices. Boston, however, has not experienced the same level of price declines
experienced in many other large markets across the U.S. where over-building is more prevalent.
Statistical Data
Statistical data relating to population, employment and income are derived primarily from five
separate sources: the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. Department of
Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics (the “Bureau of Labor Statistics”), and the City and the Boston
Redevelopment Authority (the “BRA”), each of which is described below.
The Bureau of the Census publishes information about population, housing and the economy. All
data from the 2000 Decennial Census of Population and Housing are now available. In addition, some
monthly and quarterly data are available through December 2008 on certain topics for the region, the
Commonwealth, and Metropolitan Boston. The Bureau of the Census does not publish such interim data for
the City.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis publishes quarterly and annual statistics on income and
employment. The most recent annual figures for the nation, New England, Massachusetts, Metropolitan
Boston and Suffolk County are for 2007. The most recent quarterly statistics are for the fourth quarter of
2

2008. The City accounts for approximately 87% of Suffolk County’s population and approximately 96% of
its employment.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes data and reports about the workforce and related subjects
including unemployment rates, area wages, and cost-of-living adjustments. Final data for 2007 are the most
recent annual data available. The most recent monthly data are for December 2008.
The City and the BRA prepare reports and compile data on the population and economy of the City
and its neighborhoods. The BRA also provides data and trends obtained from various local, regional, state
and national sources from both the public and private sectors on such topics as employment and
occupation, large employers, City schools, universities and colleges, medical institutions, tourism and
lodging, transportation, office and industrial markets, housing, building activity and urban redevelopment
and infrastructure projects.
The statistical data contained in this report do not necessarily reflect current activity because of
delays resulting from the time required to collect, tabulate and publish such data. While the City believes
that it has used the most recent data readily available to it in this report, the data contained herein may not
reflect current conditions or trends because of such delays. Moreover, statistical data are approximations
and generalizations subject to various sources of error inherent in the statistical process, and may be revised
on the basis of additional data. The statistical data contained herein describes past activity and are not
presented in order to suggest the continuation of any trend, or to predict future economic activity either in
particular categories or in general.
Population, Income and Employment
The Bureau of the Census reported the City’s population as 589,141 in 2000, a 2.6% increase over
1990 and building on the 2.0% increase in the 1980s. The number of households in the City increased from
218,457 in 1980, to 228,464 in 1990, and to 239,528 in 2000, while household size fell from 2.4 to 2.3
persons per household from 1980 to 2000. The Bureau of the Census population for Massachusetts in 2000
was 6,349,097, or an increase of 332,672 persons (5.5%) from the 1990 census. The population of
Metropolitan Boston (as defined below) rose to 4,391,344 in 2000, an increase of 257,449 persons or 6.2%
over the decade.
Boston’s population for 2007 was estimated by the U. S. Census Bureau to be 608,352 which showed
an increase of 3.3% from the count of 589,141 in 2000. The Bureau of the Census has also released 2007
population data for states and metropolitan areas. The population of Massachusetts as of July 1, 2007 is
estimated to have been 6,449,755, a gain of 1.6% over that for April 2000. The population of Metropolitan
Boston for July 1, 2007 is estimated to have been 4,482,857, an increase of 90,913 residents from the 2000
census, a gain of 2.1%.

Bureau of the Census.

The 2000 Census showed that Boston’s racial composition was: White, Non-Hispanic 49.5%; Black,
Non-Hispanic 23.8%; Hispanic 14.4%; Asian/Pacific Islander 7.5%; Multi-racial 3.1%; other single race
1.4%; and Native American 0.3%. The American Community Survey, from the US Census, shows that the
racial make-up of the City has not changed significantly from the 2000 Census, but does indicate that the
proportions of Hispanic and Asian are slightly higher while the proportion of Black, Non-Hispanic is down
slightly. Boston continues to be a city of young adults due to the large number of students and young adults
living and working in the City close to one out of every three persons in Boston is between 20 and 34 years
old. The baby boom population (aged 35 to 54 years) increased significantly, to 20%, as that cohort aged
and continued to show a preference for city living. The City saw a decline in the elderly population (aged
65 and over) between 1990 and 2000 as that segment declined by nearly 5,000 people to 10% of the
population. Boston showed a general rise in the number of children as that population (aged 18 and under)
increased by over 6,700 persons to 20% of the population. The trend toward fewer families of related
people living together to more non-family households comprised of single persons and roommates,
continued in Boston in the 1990s. There was also a trend toward more “non-traditional” families as the data
showed more relatives and non-relatives other than the householder and spouse living in families. Overall,
the total number of households rose. Single-person households continued to grow. Families with children
under 18 also grew, although married couples with young children fell because of the continued trend
toward single-parent families with children. Children over 18 living with their families showed an upward
trend as college students commuted in increasing numbers, and the cost of housing kept older children at
home longer. Group quarters population continued to increase both for the institutionalized and noninstitutionalized populations, the vast majority of which is the student dormitory population. Household
size declined by 2.5%, going from 2.37 to 2.31 persons despite the large growth in single person
households. Average family size edged only marginally lower from 3.19 to 3.17 persons.
The following table shows the 2002-2007 population, income and employment trends for the U.S.,
New England, Massachusetts, and Metropolitan Boston.
The six-state New England region had a combined population of 14.3 million people and 9.2 million
jobs in 2007 according to Bureau of Economic Analysis annual data. Total personal income in New
England grew at an annual average compound rate of 5.0% from 2002 through 2007, below the 5.6%
national rate for the same period. Employment in New England grew by 387,374 jobs from 2002 through
2007, an annual average of 0.9%.
Massachusetts had a population of 6.4 million people and 4.2 million jobs in 2007, according to
Bureau of Economic Analysis annual data. Total personal income in Massachusetts grew at a 4.9% annual
average rate from 2002 through 2007, slightly less than the 5.0% rate of increase for New England, and
below the national rate of 5.6%. Massachusetts gained 140,515 jobs between 2002 and 2007, an annual
average of 0.7%.
The Boston-Cambridge-Quincy MA-NH Metropolitan Statistical Area, defined by the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) to include Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, and Suffolk counties in
Massachusetts, and Rockingham and Strafford counties in New Hampshire (“Metropolitan Boston”), had
4.5 million people and 3.1 million jobs in 2006. Total personal income from 2002 through 2006 grew at an
annual average rate of 4.6%, below the national mark of 5.5%. The most recent employment data show a
gain of 107,892 jobs for the 2002-2006 period, an annual rate of 0.9%.

Employment Structure, Employment Trends and Occupational Changes
The economy of Metropolitan Boston rests primarily on high technology, finance, professional and
business services, defense, and educational and medical institutions. The City’s economy is more
specialized in the financial, governmental, business and professional services, and educational and medical
sectors, than the suburban economy, which is more specialized in high technology and the defense industry.
The table below shows Boston’s employment growth by industry category for 2006, 2007, and 2008.
The industry categories are in the new North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) format,
which the Bureau of Economic Analysis began using in 2001. Employment data from the U.S. Bureau of
Economic Analysis is through 2006. Suffolk County data is mathematically reduced to the Boston
geography using unemployment insurance coverage data (ES-202) from the Massachusetts Department of
Workforce Development (“DWD”).
Employment trends for 2006 through 2008 for Boston show that 23,869 jobs were added in two
years, a 3.6% rate of change. Health care, accommodation and food services, professional services, and
arts, entertainment, and recreation show the largest gains.

2007 is an estimate based on annual data from DWD and an estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (based on 2006
data).
2008 is an estimate based on two quarters of data from DWD and an estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (based
on 2006 data).
Other Services includes repair and maintenance, personal and laundry services, and religious, grant-making, civic,
professional, and similar organizations.
The employment figures are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis Series for Suffolk County, pro-rated to the City’s
geographical boundary using data from the Massachusetts Department of Workforce Development (“DWD”). See the
footnotes above. Due to use of pro-rating factors, minor discrepancies of 1 to 3 units between totals and employment
categories may result.

A more recent picture of employment trends for the Commonwealth and Metropolitan Boston is
available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics non-agricultural employment data. As of early February 2009
data through the month of December 2008 was available, and are presented in the following tables. Data
from the following tables shows that employment grew every month relative to the same month from the
previous year since January 2006, until November 2008 when employment began to decline relative to the
previous year. In fact, the historical data shows this to be the case in every year since June 2004. In
December 2008 a loss of 20,300 jobs in Metropolitan Boston was evident from December of 2007.
Although Metropolitan Boston lost jobs in November and December of 2008, the area still had 99,200
more jobs in December 2008 than in the same month of 2006.

The following table indicates that, as of 2007, 67% of City residents were White-Collar workers and
33% were Blue-Collar and Service workers, as compared to 1970 when 55% were White-Collar workers
7

and 45% were Blue-Collar and Service workers. The trend among City residents away from Blue-Collar
and Service occupations and toward White-Collar occupations was evident between 1970 and 1990 (this
trend actually began prior to 1970; in 1960 only 44% of city residents worked in white collar jobs). During
the decade of the 1990s this trend showed some change. White-Collar occupations continued to grow but at
a slower pace, with Managerial, Professional, & Related jobs gaining but Sales & Office jobs declining. At
the same time, Blue-Collar & Service occupations continued to decline, with the exception of Production,
Transportation & Related workers who showed a modest increase between 1990 & 2000. Between 2000
and 2007, the proportion of white collar workers in the city actually declined slightly.

As the following table illustrates, monthly data for most areas in New England for 2007 showed
unemployment rates that were improved over 2006. For the first four months of 2008, Boston’s
unemployment rate compared favorably with those for 2007. Rising unemployment rates became evident in
the U. S. economy beginning in September of 2007 continuing through December of 2008 while rising
unemployment rates in New England, Massachusetts, and Boston became evident starting in May 2008 and
also continuing through December. In December 2008 Boston’s unemployment rate was, however,
significantly lower than that of the US; 6.0% compared to 7.1%, respectively.

In addition, the public sector has large numbers of employees in the City. According to the BRA,
using a series consistent with the Bureau of Economic Analysis, there were an estimated 77,623 federal
9

state and local government workers in the City in 2008. Certain state government offices, federal regional
offices, U.S. Postal Service facilities, state-chartered authorities and commissions (such as the
Massachusetts Port Authority and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority), and the City’s local
government are all located within the City.
Labor Force and Education
According to the Bureau of the Census, the City’s resident labor force has been steadily increasing
from 1980 through 2007. Since 1980, the increase in the number and age of the population have combined
with the rising labor force participation of women, minorities, youth and the elderly to produce a larger
labor force overall. Bureau of the Census data show that by 1990, the City’s population had increased by
2% over 1980 levels, while the City’s labor force increased by 12.8%. During the 1990’s Boston’s
population continued to rise, posting a 2.6% increase while the age 25+ labor force grew by 3.2%. And,
from 2000 through 2007 Boston’s population rose by 3.3% and the labor force grew by 5.7%.
General improvement in educational attainment of residents aged 25 and over continued
throughout the 1980-2007 period. The percentage of this population that had completed four or more years
of college almost doubled during this period from 20.3% to 40.3%. This change, in part, reflected the trend
for an increasing percentage of Boston public school system graduates to seek higher education. This
percentage increased from 25% in 1960 to 78% in 2002, based upon Boston School Department figures.
Improving educational attainment levels and shifting occupational patterns suggest a concurrent
transformation of the City’s work force as the City’s economy has moved to a service-dominated
employment base.
The City supports entry-level and advanced job training programs, including the following: Englishas-a-Second Language training, pre-vocational and vocational training, adult literacy training, and support
counseling. In addition, linkage contributions paid into the Neighborhood Jobs Trust provide a
supplemental source of funding for job training programs. For a full discussion of the City’s housing and
jobs linkage program see “The Linkage Program,” below.

Income, Wages, and Cost of Living
Per capita personal income for Suffolk County was $49,239 in 2006, 34% above the national per
capita personal income of $36,744, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. City residents constitute
approximately 87% of the County’s population. An historical summary of per capita income shows that
from 1980 to 1990 Suffolk County’s per capita income grew at a rate greater than that for the nation, in
contrast to the 1970-1980 period when it rose at a slower rate. Suffolk County’s per capita income grew at
a faster rate than the per capita income growth rates for the United States, New England, and Massachusetts
and just barely below the rate of growth for Metropolitan Boston between 1990 and 2000. The City’s
median household income (in current year dollars), based on Census data, rose from $7,835 in 1970, to
$12,530 in 1980, $29,180 in 1990 and $39,629 in 2000. The figures in this paragraph and the chart directly
below reflect earned income of persons residing in the named areas plus rents, interest and other unearned
income and transfer payments from governmental entities. As such, these figures take into account certain
income sources not included in the survey of average annual wages in the following paragraph, which
reflects earned income of persons who work (but do not necessarily reside) in the named areas.

Medical and Higher Educational Institutions
Boston’s medical and educational institutions are an important component of its economy, providing
employment opportunities for residents of the City and Metropolitan Boston. Expenditures by the
institutions’ patients, students and visitors are important to the City’s trade and service sectors.
Twenty-one inpatient hospitals are located within the City, including Massachusetts General
Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Children’s Hospital,
Tufts Medical Center, and Boston Medical Center. These hospitals had a combined total of 6,399 beds in
2006 according to the most recent data from the American Hospital Association. In 2006, the hospitals
admitted 200,150 in-patients, and had over 5.8 million outpatient visits, according to data from the
American Hospital Association (with three hospitals not reporting data other than beds). The City is also
the home of the medical and dental schools of Harvard, Tufts and Boston Universities, and of twenty-five
public neighborhood health clinics, not including health maintenance organizations and membership
clinics.
In 2008, there were 117,914 health services jobs in the City, see the table “City of Boston
Employment, 2006-2008.” Health services represent over one out of every six jobs within the City. Growth
in the health services sector has been stable, despite varying economic conditions. Data from this
employment series showed that the number of hospital employees in Boston between 2006 and 2008 grew
from 75,840 to 81,426.
In 2007 and 2008, there were three hospital or medical research building projects completed: the $80
million sciences building with 160,000 square feet of medical research space at Boston University Medical
Center’s BioSquare (Parcel D in the South End); the Lyme Properties’ 575,000 square-foot Blackfan
Research Center in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area; and Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s
350,000 square-foot Center for Advanced Medicine.
As of February 2009 there are five hospital and medical research developments under construction.
Among them are the Massachusetts General Hospital’s 526,000 square-foot Building for the Third Century;
Boston University Medical Center’s BioSafety Level 4 (BSL4) research facility (Phase 2, Parcel F in the
South End) nearing completion pending regulatory approval; Boston Medical Center’s 245,000 square-foot
New Ambulatory Care Building; and Dana Farber Cancer Institute’s 275,000 square-foot Center for Cancer
12

Care, in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area; and the 95,000 square foot addition to Tufts Dental
School on Harrison Avenue in Chinatown In addition the 440,000 square-foot Longwood North Research
Center medical research building also in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area, recently acquired by
Children’s Hospital, has been approved but is not yet underway. In 2008, the BRA approved a new 10-year
Institutional Master Plan for Children’s Hospital Boston. The BRA also approved an amendment to the
Joslin Diabetes Center Institutional Master Plan, allowing for the eventual construction of the 350,000
square-foot Longwood Center project in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area.
For the fourteenth straight year, Boston has been the highest-ranking city in the United States for
National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant awards, receiving more than $1.6 billion in research grants during
fiscal 2007. Boston’s hospitals continue to attract funding, comprising the top five independent hospitals in
the nation in terms of receiving NIH awards, and seven out of the top fourteen. In addition to public monies
for medical research the Boston institutions also have private funding sources through agreements with
private sector firms.
Greater Boston has one of the nation’s largest clusters of life sciences industries. According to a
January 2007 report by Battelle entitled “Growing the Nation’s Bioscience Sector: A Regional
Perspective,” Boston-Cambridge-Quincy ranks fifth among the 25 metropolitan regions with over 10,000
employment in the bio-sciences specialties with 42,323 jobs (20,051 in research, testing, and medical
laboratories; 15,874 in medical devices and equipment; 5,984 in drugs and pharmaceuticals; and 417 in
chemicals). On a per-capita basis, Boston-Cambridge-Quincy also ranked fifth among the 25 metropolitan
areas with biosciences employing at least 10,000, with 9.58 biosciences employees per 1,000. While
Cambridge is the center for those industries in Greater Boston, the City of Boston itself is seeing significant
industry growth in these fields with real estate development such as the Bio-Square project, the BioSafety
Level 4 Research Facility both in the South End, and the recent completion of the Center for Life Sciences
(CLSB) in the heart of the Longwood Medical Area (LMA).
As of academic year 2006-2007, the New England Board of Higher Education reported that the
City’s 34 universities, colleges, and community colleges had a combined enrollment in fall of 2006 of
154,777. These numbers, the most currently available, include some of the professional and graduate
schools of Harvard and Tufts Universities, whose principal campuses are in Cambridge and Medford,
respectively. Based on total graduate, undergraduate, and professional school enrollment, Boston
University was the largest university in Boston in the fall of 2006, with 33,700 students. Boston, with only
10% of the state’s population, has 33% of the statewide college student enrollment.
From 2003 through 2008 there were three higher education academic projects completed at Boston’s
universities: Boston College added a faculty administration building with 156,000 square feet of office
space; Harvard University expanded its Baker Library at the Harvard Business School; and Simmons
College completed an expansion of its campus library. In addition Boston College High School constructed
a new wing housing a Junior High School facility.
As of February 2009 there were five higher education academic and office projects underway: at
Simmons College a new Management School will open in fall of 2009; at Emerson College as part of the
Paramount dormitory currently being built is a structure of 80,000 square feet to house classrooms, office
administration space and a theater; at Emmanuel College completion is nearing at a 46,800 square foot
building wing to house an Academic Sciences Building replacing the demolition of a small structure called
St. James Hall; at Suffolk University at 20 Somerset Street the demolition of the obsolete building will be
replaced by a new 112,000 square foot building which will house Suffolk’s New England School of Art
and Design with classrooms and adjacent reconstruction of the existing Roemer Plaza public open space;
and at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences construction continues on a 49,700
square-foot academic building with classrooms, faculty offices, a computer center, teaching laboratories, as
well as assembly and multi-function space.
Also as of February 2009 there were four higher education academic building projects approved but
not yet under construction: Harvard University’s Science Complex entailing construction of a research
facility of 530,000 square feet on Western Avenue in the Allston neighborhood, which is to contain
academic space, underground parking, and a small amount of retail space; Suffolk University’s restoration
of the Modern Theater on Washington Street in downtown Boston into a 3,000 square foot (185 seat) studio
theater with a 1,000 square foot art gallery and 5,200 square feet of pre-function and support space
underneath the residence hall addition; and, at Simmons College the small 5,898 square foot addition to the
existing on-campus dining hall.
13

Between 2000 and year-end 2007, 23 dormitories with 7,321 dormitory beds (6,571 undergraduate
and 750 graduate) opened to house Boston’s college students. In 2007 two dormitories were finished: the
Trilogy project at 180 Brookline Street in the Fenway, with 170 graduate student beds for Harvard
University; and 275 beds for Suffolk University at 10 West Street downtown. The recent additions mean
that Boston’s colleges and universities now accommodate over 32,000 students in on-campus housing
facilities. There are currently five dormitories under construction: the 115-bed Wheelock College student
residences at 154 The Riverway, to be completed in May 2009; the 364-bed renovation of the Colonial
Building by Emerson College at 80 Boylston Street in the downtown district; the 262-bed Emerson College
dormitory adjacent to the Paramount Theater on Washington Street downtown; the new 1,200 bed
Residence Hall I of Northeastern University at Tremont and Ruggles Streets in the South End; and the new
960-bed Armory Dorm Phase 2 by Boston University at 899 Commonwealth Avenue in Brighton. While
college enrollment remains stable, new student housing is pulling students out of neighborhood housing,
easing housing prices and ameliorating tight vacancies. Several future dorms have been approved and
several more are under review. Recently approved was a future new Emmanuel College dormitory of
77,500 square feet to house 200 students on the corner of Beacon Street and The Fenway on the existing
campus.
Tourism and Culture
According to the Greater Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau (“CVB”), an estimated 18.3 million
people visited the Boston metropolitan area in 2008, up by 4.0% from the 17.6 million visitors in 2005.
These data represent visitors, measured as tourists, business travelers and convention and meeting delegates
who traveled at least 100 miles to get to the City. The latest data on the economic impact of tourism from
the CVB show that, for greater Boston, domestic and international visitors had an estimated $7.2 billion
spending impact for hotel accommodations, meals, entertainment, shopping, transportation and other
services during 2008. The latest data for Suffolk County indicates that in the county alone the total
domestic direct traveler impact in 2006 was $6.0 billion, supporting 42,860 jobs and a payroll of $1.3
billion, while generating $154 million in state tax receipts and $105 million of local tax receipts.
The City of Boston is home to three major professional sports teams: the Boston Red Sox baseball
team, the Boston Bruins hockey team, and the World Champion Boston Celtics basketball team. The New
England Patriots football team play in Gillette Stadium in nearby Foxborough, Massachusetts. The City
also provides venues for concerts, ice shows, circuses, theater, and other entertainment performances and
amateur sports events. The TD Banknorth Garden home to the Celtics and Bruins and opened in 1995 is a
privately-financed, multi-purpose arena in Boston’s North Station District constructed by the New Boston
Garden Corporation, a subsidiary of Delaware North. The ownership of the Boston Red Sox baseball
franchise have undertaken renovations of the existing Fenway Park, including the addition of new seating
and modernizing facilities, and have also proposed additional changes to the existing structure and also in
the surrounding neighborhood.
Boston is an attractive destination for conventions, meetings, and trade-and-gate shows. Currently
Boston has three small and medium convention sites, the John B. Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention
Center (“Hynes”), the World Trade Center and the Bayside Exposition Center, with a combined capacity of
over one million people per year, and the 1.6 million square-foot Boston Convention and Exhibition Center
(“BCEC”) that can host large national conventions. In 2008 the Hynes and the BCEC hosted 239 events
with 915,616 attendees. This resulted in 627,413 hotel room nights, $261 million in direct spending, $18.5
million in direct tax revenue, and generated an overall economic impact of $523 million.
Since 2000 several new cultural facilities have opened. The New England Aquarium completed an
expansion plan including opening the new Simons IMAX Theater. The Boston Center for the Arts and the
Huntington Theatre combined to complete joint development of two new theaters next to the Boston Center
for the Arts in the South End in the fall of 2004 – the first new live stage theaters in Boston in 75 years.
Downtown, Clear Channel, Inc. completed its $37 million renovation of The Boston Opera House on
Washington Street in the summer of 2004. A newly constructed Institute of Contemporary Art museum
opened on the South Boston waterfront in 2006. The 65,000 square-foot building features galleries, a
“mediatheque” with computer stations for accessing digital media, a 325-seat theater, and workshop and
classroom spaces.
Several cultural institutions are pursuing development plans that are either currently proposed,
approved, or under construction. The Museum of Fine Arts has a 462,400 square-foot multi-phase
14

expansion currently under construction. Also, the Gardner museum, one of the oldest and most noteworthy
museums in the Fenway section of Boston is planning an expansion of its facilities.
In May, 2005 the Mayor launched Create Boston, an economic development program at the BRA that
is designed to help creative businesses and individuals achieve their full potential for success. The program
focuses on film, music, design, media, visual arts/crafts and performance, and provides resources in
financial and site location assistance, workforce development and business advocacy; and is geared
specifically toward business development and job creation. Currently the program focuses on strengthening
and growing digital media and specifically the Boston video game industry. The Mayor recently established
the first Boston-area Game Industry Steering Committee that meets monthly to address the issues and
challenges facing the industry and further the BRA’s effort to raise Boston’s profile as a global leader in
the game industry. On March 13, 2009 the Mayor will launch the first Game Industry Website. Following
the 2007 “PoweringUp” conference funded in-part by the Mass Cultural Council (MCC), area video game
companies have increased from 58 to 76 and two major universities have launched master’s degree
programs in game design and interactive multimedia and game engineering. For a description of Boston’s
artists’ housing program see the section below on “Housing Stock, Housing Values, and Development.
Hotel Market
Between July 1997 and December 2008 Boston built 6,671 rooms in 31 new hotels and 5 hotel
expansions. Boston’s favorable hotel market and the decision to build the Boston Convention and
Exposition Center stimulated considerable new development over this period. Since 1992, Boston’s annual
occupancy rates have exceeded 72% in 14 out of the 16 years.
From the beginning of 2004 through 2007 the following hotels were completed: an 81-room
Courtyard by Marriott at 88 Exeter Street in the Back Bay; the Hotel Onyx, a 112-room Kimpton hotel near
North Station; the Hampton Inn at Crosstown, a 175-room new hotel that is part of a mixed-use
development of office, hotel, and retail space in Roxbury; Jurys Boston, a 220-room Jurys Doyle
establishment in the Back Bay created through the adaptive re-use of the former police headquarters
building; the Bulfinch Clarion Hotel, an 80-room adaptive reuse development near North Station; a 164room Courtyard by Marriott in the South Bay/Roxbury district; the 40 room Hotel 140 in the Back Bay; the
793 room Westin BCEC Headquarters Hotel, attached to the new Boston Convention and Exhibition Center
in South Boston; the 424-room Intercontinental Hotel on the downtown waterfront; and the 308-room
Liberty Hotel, which includes the adaptive reuse of the historic Charles Street Jail. Four hotels opened in
2008: The 471-room Marriott Renaissance on the South Boston waterfront; the 150-room Battery Wharf
Fairmount on the downtown waterfront; the 149-room Mandarin Oriental, a mixed-use project including
condominium residences and retail space in the Back Bay; and the 16-room Inn @ St. Botolph. As of
December 2008 there were a total of 18,098 hotel rooms in establishments of 50 or more rooms in Boston
as a net result of the developments detailed above, and the closing of two older hotels.
Two additional hotels with a total of 353 rooms are in construction in Boston as of February 2009:
The 118-room Ames Hotel is an adaptive reuse of an historic office building near Government Center
scheduled to open in mid-2009 and the “W” Hotel with 235 rooms in the Theater District scheduled to open
also in 2009. Construction of the 257-room hotel included in the mixed use redevelopment of the
Downtown Crossing site of the former Filene’s Department Store―known as One Franklin Street―was
placed on hold in December 2008 pending financing but completion is now anticipated by 2011. Seven
more hotels have BRA Board approvals but are not yet under construction.
Between 1991 and 2000, average annual occupancy rates grew from 70.1% to 78.4% and average
daily room rates rose steadily from $118.17 to $198.00 according to Pinnacle Advisory Group, an
independent hospitality industry consultant. The year 2001 brought a more challenging environment for the
hospitality industry as a slowing economy combined with the events of September 11th dampened hotel
market performance in Boston. In 2001 the occupancy rate fell to 69.6% and the room rate to $180.58. By
2003 hotel room demand was growing again, but room supply continued its steady growth too, resulting in
a 71.1% occupancy rate and $155.52 average daily rate in that year. Between 2003 and 2008 Boston room
demand grew by 27.2% over these five years and 2008 occupancy reached 75.1% with average daily rates
averaging $210.39, according to the Pinnacle Advisory Group. Revenue per available room was $157.98 in
2008, just below the high mark of $159.95 reached in 2007.

Transportation
The City is a major national and international air terminus, a seaport, and the center of New
England’s rail, truck and bus service. The City is served by three limited-access interstate highways which
connect it to the national highway system: U.S. 90 (the “Massachusetts Turnpike”), which leads westward
from downtown Boston 138 miles to the New York State border; U.S. 95, the East Coast’s principal northsouth highway, which connects Boston to Portland, Maine to the north and New York City and
Washington, D.C. to the south; and U.S. 93, another north-south interstate highway, that extends from just
south of the City north to New Hampshire. The City is also served by two national railroads, Amtrak and
Conrail, a regional rail carrier, Boston and Maine (a subsidiary of Guilford Transportation Industries), and
Bay Colony, a local carrier.
Transportation planning includes both major highway and mass transit programs. The Massachusetts
Bay Transportation Authority (“MBTA”) provides commuter rail, subway, local bus and express bus
services to 175 cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts, offering public transit alternatives to a population
of almost 4.7 million people in an area of 3,200 square miles. The MBTA, the fifth largest mass transit
system in the nation as determined by ridership, currently serves about 1.24 million passengers per day.
The MBTA’s Capital Investment Program totals approximately $3.75 billion over fiscal years 20092013, averaging about $750 million per year. The Capital Investment Program consists of five major
programmatic areas: (i) reinvestment in the infrastructure ($2.276 billion); (ii) accessibility improvements
($172 million); (iii) enhancement of existing service ($256 million); (iv) system expansion efforts ($165
million) and (v) statewide transportation improvements ($879 million). Capital Investment Program
spending by transportation mode is as follows: subway, $2.107 billion; commuter rail, $914 million;; bus,
$442 million; system wide, $193 million; and Silver Line, $94 million. The major infrastructure projects
include: vehicles ($1.020 billion); station modernization ($352 million); maintenance facilities, including
rail car houses and bus garages ($306 million); rail signaling systems ($149 million); power ($121 million;
track/right-of-way ($113 million); bridges ($66 million); fare equipment ($42 million; and communications
($9.6 million).
Within Boston the most significant subway enhancement project is the Silver Line. The MBTA’s
2009-2013 Capital Investment Program only includes $94 million for the Silver Line project in Boston
which are funds for the planning and design of Phase III because construction is not yet funded. If
completed, the full Silver Line would provide new service within Boston’s urban areas to Roxbury, South
Boston, and Downtown. The MBTA completed the first two phases of the Silver Line. Phase I, completed
in July 2002, provides bus rapid transit services along Washington Street (through the Downtown,
Chinatown, the South End, and Roxbury neighborhoods) with 14 new stations. Phase II, completed in
2006, provides bus rapid transit services along the South Boston Piers Transitway, which extends from
South Station along the South Boston waterfront to the Federal Courthouse to World Trade Center and
beyond to the tunnel to the airport. Phase III of the Silver Line would entail construction of a tunnel from
Washington Street to South Station and Logan Airport that will connect the Phase I and Phase II segments.
Eventual construction of Phase III depends on funding availability at both the local and national levels.

Since 1991, Amtrak has spent $1.8 billion on a multi-year high-speed rail infrastructure project
intended to provide better ride quality, permit faster train speeds, and increase capacity for passengers on
the rail corridor between Boston and New York. Ridership between Boston and New York has grown
significantly as a result of the new high-speed service, despite the general downturn in the economy and
regional travel. In fiscal year 2007 Amtrak carried 975,826 passengers between New York and Boston―an
increase of 41% over the pre-Acela year of 2001. Amtrak commenced Boston—Portland, Maine passenger
rail service (the “Downeaster”) in 2001. The 200-passenger train runs four times a day in each direction
between North Station and Portland. The trip makes intermediate stops in Woburn and Haverhill
(Massachusetts), Exeter, Durham, and Dover (New Hampshire), and Wells, Saco, and Old Orchard Beach
(Maine).
For a description of the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project see “Large Public Sector
Projects,” below.
Seaport and Airport
The Massachusetts Port Authority (“Massport”) was created by the state legislature to develop and
manage the City’s major air and sea transportation centers, and the Tobin Memorial Bridge over the Mystic
River. Massport is financially independent, and the City is not responsible for any debt or other obligations
incurred by Massport. Heavy use of Boston Logan International Airport (“Logan Airport”) and the Port of
Boston has compelled significant expansion of both facilities. Massport’s net investment in its facilities
through June 2008 exceeded $3.98 billion, consisting of $3.38 billion invested in airports and $598 million
invested in the Tobin Bridge, maritime development and other capital projects. In February 2008, Massport
projected that it would spend about $899 million during fiscal years 2008-2012 for ongoing capital
improvements to Hanscom Field, Logan Airport, the Tobin Memorial Bridge and the port facilities, and for
improvements and major maintenance at various other Massport properties.
The Port of Boston serves the six-state New England region as a natural deep-water berth, and
provides access to world ports as well as weekly barge service the Port of New York/New Jersey. (The
prior feeder service suspended operations in December 2007.) The City’s port activity includes handling
containerized bulk and general cargo, providing ship repair supply services, offering customs and
international trading services, providing storage facilities and other commercial maritime services. The Port
of Boston is also a major cruise port. The total number of cruise passengers in fiscal 2008 (236,922)
increased by 17.9% compared to fiscal 2007 The cruise port mainly operates in the months of May through
October.
The Port of Boston ranked as the 11th largest container port on the U.S. Atlantic Coast by container
volume. During fiscal 2008, the Port activity of 1,116,000 boxed containers increased 4.5% over that of
fiscal 2007, while the 15,546 automobiles handled in fiscal 2008 increased by 51.6% from fiscal 2007 and
the 206,494 tons (in bulk tonnage) for fiscal 2008 increased by 9.7% from fiscal 2007’s bulk tonnage.
In Calendar 2008, Logan Airport served a total of 26.1 million passengers, a 7.1% decrease from the
28.1 million passengers served in 2007. A report on calendar year 2007 prepared by Airports Council
International (“ACI”) showed that Logan was the most active airport in New England, the 19th most active
in the United States and the 41st most active in the world. A new runway at Logan airport was completed
late in 2006. Logan Airport also plays an important role as a center for processing domestic and
international air cargo. According to ACI, Logan Airport ranked 19th in the nation in total air cargo volume
in 2007. In fiscal 2008 total combined cargo and mail volume was 544.6 million pounds, a 5.2% decrease
from the 680.1 million pounds handled in fiscal 2007.

Construction Activity
The following table sets forth construction activity in the City from fiscal years 2000-2009, estimated
as indicated in the notes to the table. It should be noted that the issuance of a building permit and payment
of a fee do not necessarily result in construction activity. The estimated revenue from building permit fees
during fiscal 2009 (based on seven months of data) indicated that total construction activity is projected to
total $3.93 billion; higher than all the previous years shown. Revenue from building permit fees increased
in all but one of the fiscal years between 1999 and 2009. Between fiscal years 2008 and 2009, building
permit revenue increased is estimated to increase by 11%. As mentioned above data for fiscal year 2009 is
an estimate based on seven months of data.

Large Public Sector Projects
In addition to major construction projects of the MBTA and Massport, Boston has witnessed several
other major public sector projects including the Boston Convention and Exposition Center (“BCEC”)
Project and the Central Artery/Tunnel (“CA/T”), the downtown highway tunnel through the City including
the Ted Williams tunnel under Boston Harbor. The CA/T Project, which has improved traffic flow in
Boston since its completion, is under the control of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority.
The CA/T Project includes the Ted Williams Tunnel, connecting Logan Airport and the North Shore
to Downtown Boston and the western suburbs, the Leverett Circle Connector Bridge, a four-lane bridge
over the Charles River carrying traffic between Leverett Circle in downtown Boston and U.S. 93 in
Charlestown, the extension of U.S. 90 under Fort Point Channel to South Boston connecting with the
highway with the Ted Williams Tunnel and Logan Airport in East Boston, and the Central Artery and the
Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge over the Charles River. The CA/T Project, with an estimated total
cost of $14.63 billion, was half funded by the federal government while the remainder was the
responsibility of the Commonwealth.
The BCEC Project was constructed on a 60-acre site in South Boston through the joint efforts of the
City, the Commonwealth, the BRA, and the MCCA. The 1.6 million square-foot facility, was completed in
2004 and includes approximately 516,000 square feet of contiguous exhibition space on one level,
approximately 160,000 square feet of meeting space and a 40,000 square-foot ballroom, as well as banquet
and lecture halls. The BRA was authorized by the Convention Center Act to acquire and prepare the site for
the BCEC Project and now the MCCA is the owner and operator of the BCEC. In 2008 the BCEC hosted
conventions with 550,000 attendees and since opening in late 2004 has hosted over 1.45 million
18

conventioneers. In addition to the BCEC Project, a 793-room convention center hotel on the northeast
corner of the BCEC Project site opened in June 2006.
The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (“MWRA”), an independent state authority, has
recently completed construction of the major components of its Integrated Water Supply Improvement
Program including the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel, Norumbega Covered Storage Reservoir and the
John J. Carroll Water Treatment Plant. The Integrated Water Supply Improvement Program has cost
approximately $1.1 billion through June 30, 2008. In addition, MWRA continues to operate the Deer Island
Treatment Plant. This project, which was undertaken pursuant to a federal district court order, was part of
MWRA’s capital improvement program costing approximately $3.8 billion and brought wastewater
discharges into compliance with federal and state requirements.
The MWRA has also spent approximately $1.2 billion on improvements to its wastewater system
improvements and approximately $1.6 billion on waterworks system through June 30, 2008. The largest
expenditures have been for the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel, the John J. Carroll Water Treatment
Plant, improved water storage facilities and reduction of combined sewer overflows.
The MWRA-approved FY09 Capital Improvement Program anticipates the spending of
approximately $1.7 billion on additional water and wastewater system improvements between Fiscal Year
2009 and Fiscal Year 2013, and $912.8 million in 2014 and beyond. The largest expenditures will be for
the combined sewer overflow (CSO) control plan, interceptor and pumping improvements and water
distribution system improvements. The largest component of the combined sewer overflow control plan is
the North Dorchester Bay CSO Storage Tunnel and related facilities. Relatively small portions of the other
improvements are located within the City, but they should nonetheless provide major improvements in the
system infrastructure that serves the City.
The Boston Housing Authority (“BHA”) between 1997 and 2008 completed major revitalization
initiatives at four public housing developments: Mission Main, in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston;
Orchard Park, in Roxbury; West Broadway in South Boston; and Maverick Gardens in East Boston. The
BHA was able to initiate the revitalization of three of these developments when it was awarded HOPE VI
grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”). The grants, totaling $105
million, were used to implement a new approach to public housing financing, incorporating innovative
partnerships with public and private entities that leveraged additional development funds. The initiatives
not only revitalized the BHA sites, but the surrounding neighborhoods as well. West Broadway, a state
funded public housing development, was redeveloped through the use of a public/private partnership that
included state and city funding. In addition, the BHA is in the process of revitalizing the Franklin Hill
public housing development through a fifth public private partnership.
Empowerment Zone Designation
In 1999, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) designated part of the City
an Empowerment Zone (“EZ”). The EZ, wholly within Boston, encompasses 6.953 square miles, running
north to south right through the center of the City, including parts of the neighborhoods of South Boston,
Downtown, the Seaport District, Chinatown, the South End, Mission Hill, Roxbury, Jamaica Plain, and
Dorchester. The Empowerment Zone also includes two development sites, the “Massachusetts Turnpike
Air Rights” and Morton Plaza in Mattapan. The EZ contains 58,717 residents, roughly 10% of the City’s
population and contains a variety of businesses from internationally known financial firms and retail stores
to industrial uses to neighborhood businesses.
Boston Connects, Inc. (BCI) was established in November 1999 to oversee and implement the
Empowerment Zone Strategic Plan. A 501(c) 3 organization, BCI has a Board of 24 members, 12 appointed
by the Mayor and 12 elected from the Zone.
The Empowerment Zone is entering into its final year of a 10 year designation. The Initiative has
continued to create opportunities in human development to enable residents of the Empowerment Zone to
reach economic self sufficiency through job readiness job training and job placement, educational programs
such as GED attainment and English as a Second Language, employment of youth in summer and year
round jobs. Over 6,000 residents have benefited from the services of the Empowerment Zone.
The Empowerment Zone provides for economic development projects. The EZ designation makes
Boston eligible to share in proposed federal grants and tax-exempt bonding authority to finance
revitalization and job creation programs for 10 years. The ten-year EZ designation brings with it $130
19

million in tax-exempt bonding authority for qualified projects. Pilot Seafood in the Seaport District, The
Best Western Roundhouse Hotel and Katsiroubas Brothers located in Newmarket, and Crosstown Center
have used tax-exempt bonds. In June 2008 Paratak Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as approved for $14M in
Enterprise Facility Bonds. To date $80M in bonding authority has been used creating 300 jobs in the
Empowerment Zone while improving the infrastructures of communities in the Empowerment Zone.
The Empowerment Zone has micro-loan programs as a economic development tool. A major strategy
for strengthening communities in the Empowerment Zone is to ensure that there is a strong, expanding base
of small businesses that provide jobs to local residents. Today more than ever, main street businesses need
capital to survive the current economic crisis.
Boston Connects, Inc. had made available $350,000 in microloan funds to strengthen existing
business as well as start new businesses in the Empowerment Zone. Loans are available in the amounts of
$500 to $25,000 Administered by the Department of Neighborhood Development, assistance in business
planning including business assessment, pre- and post-loan counseling is available. Individuals and
businesses interested in applying for a microloan should contact the City of Boston’s Department of
Neighborhood Development.
Office Market and New Development
The City and its neighborhoods currently have approximately 70.9 million square feet of office space.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, Boston’s overall vacancy rate according to CB Richard Ellis was 7.3%
(and 13.2% availability when including space to sublet). Another realty firm, Jones Lang LaSalle, placed
the City’s office vacancy rate at 7.8%, but reports the availability rate to be 13.6%. The vacancy rate,
increased during the four quarters of 2008.
Net absorption of office space during the fourth quarter of 2008, according to CB Richard Ellis,
decreased by 379,160 square feet. CB Richard Ellis claims that positive absorption of office space has now
been evident for fifteen consecutive quarters. Jones Lang LaSalle stated that total net absorption of office
space in downtown Boston for full-year 2008 was -711,688 square feet. Office rents have been gradually
decreasing The uncertain national economic climate and distressed capital markets have begun to slow
growth in rental rates and to slow tenant demand somewhat although the small amount of new supply
underway and the small amount of sublease space available bodes well for only a moderate vacancy rate
increase ahead.

There is no accepted standard accounting for office vacancy rates so private realty firm surveys vary
based upon the amount of office space covered, geographical coverage, and inclusion of new or old office
space.
Despite the worsening picture of office market data Boston still compares favorably to other
downtown office markets around the nation. As of the fourth quarter of 2008, CB Richard Ellis ranked
Boston’s downtown office market as having the best vacancy rate among the twenty largest downtown
office markets in the U.S., with a rate of 7.2%.

In 2004 and 2005, four major downtown office projects with 1.5 million square feet of new office
space were completed: ManuLife Financial, a 14-story, 470,000 square-foot building in the South Boston
Waterfront area; 33 Arch Street a $240 million, 936,000 square-foot building (533,197 square feet of office
space and a 880 car garage); 100 Cambridge Street (the former Saltonstall state office building), a 278,849
square-foot renovation of an existing building (half of which will be occupied by state offices, with the
other half rented to private sector tenants); and the 226 Causeway Street renovation, with 171,610 square
feet in the North Station district. From 2006 through mid-2008 only a few downtown office projects were
added to supply: Lincoln Plaza, a renovation of an existing building in the South Station sub-market to
mixed uses with 119,000 square feet of office space was done; Atlantic Wharf a 517,000 square foot
completion in the downtown waterfront was completed; and 2 existing office buildings totaling 355,000
square feet formerly used by the Christian Science Center were added in the Back Bay (although not a new
development) .
As of February 2009, two office buildings were under construction and several office buildings had
been approved by the BRA Board and/or have been proposed. The two projects now in construction are:
the 500,000 square foot One Marina Drive – Fan Pier in the South Boston Seaport District and Two
Financial Center, a 214,000 square-foot building near South Station. Three approved but not-yet-started
projects where some site preparation and demolition have begun include: Russia Wharf at 540 Atlantic
Avenue on the downtown waterfront with 660,000 square feet of new office space; the South Station tower,
a new building of 1.375 million square feet by Hines of Houston, Texas; and the Filene’s tower rebuild at
One Franklin Street by the Vornado Realty Trust and Gale International with 572,600 square feet of new
space. These projects await both financing and major tenant commitments.
Retail Market
For 2008, based on two quarters of data, it is estimated that there are about 68,593 employees in retail
stores, and food service and eating and drinking establishments in the City, with 32,377 in retail, and
36,216 in food service and eating and drinking. In 2002, according to the Census of Retail Trade, about
2,228 retail establishments were located in the City with an estimated total sales of $5.4 billion. The food
service and eating and drinking establishment industry in Boston (restaurants and bars) consists of an
additional 1,858 establishments with $1.7 billion in sales. The sector is rounded out by some 14,000
employees in the personal service businesses, which includes repair and maintenance, hair and nail care,
and laundry and dry cleaning service. The 2007 Census of Retail Trade data is scheduled for release in
2010.

The redevelopment of One Franklin, the former Filene’s site, expected to restart in 2009, with
Filene’s Basement scheduled to move back into new, larger space in early 2010. Suffolk University has
started construction at The Modern Theater, next door to the new retail/dormitory building at 10 West
Street. Boston Common Coffee Company is under construction in one of two ground floor retail spaces at
10 West. Downtown Crossing welcomed 3 new restaurants―Marliave, Max and Dylan’s, and Bina
Osteria―as well as a gourmet market, Bina Alimentari. Currently there are an additional 9 new retail
businesses under construction in the Downtown Crossing District including a 6,000 square foot restaurant
planned for the new Ames Hotel with 140 rooms scheduled to open in 2009.
In the Fenway neighborhood, Trilogy, a mixed use development, added Chipotle and Phillipo Style
Hair Salon to the retail mix that includes Boston’s first West Elm store, Citibank, Starbucks, Emack and
Bolio’s Ice Cream, and Burton’s Grill. A ribbon cutting was celebrated at 1330 Boylston Street, a mixed
use development also in the Fenway in September 2009. This site has apartments, ground floor retail and
restaurant space and will be the future home of the Fenway Community Health Center. The Crosstown
commercial complex in the South End is wrapping up Phase II which will bring the total square feet of
retail space up to 48,000. Current retail tenants include Dunkin Donuts, Halisi Day Spa, Quiznos, and
Enterprise Rental Cars. In Roslindale, Staples opened their first LEED certified store in the New England
area in the long vacant Ashmont Discount site on Washington Street. Also in Roslindale, Stop and Shop
has filed their plans for 100,000 square feet of new construction at the former Bradley’s site on Cummings
Highway and LA Fitness is under construction in a former Stop and Shop site on the VFW Parkway in
West Roxbury. AJ Wright continues to do a brisk business in their Field’s Corner Mall store in Dorchester
and is currently searching for four additional locations in Boston’s neighborhoods.
There are now 19 neighborhood business districts operating within the City’s Main Streets Program.
This program is a public-private initiative of the City established in 1995 to revitalize neighborhood
commercial districts through locally established organizations. The program, from its inception through the
end of fiscal year 2008, has generated 676 net new and expanded businesses, created 4,382 net new jobs,
assisted in 641 storefront improvement projects, and given design assistance to 781 businesses. Through
fiscal year 2008, the Main Streets Program had dispensed more that $1.9 million in total physical
improvement grants which had leveraged more than $10.5 million in private investment, a leverage ratio of
5.5 to 1.
Also of importance are the supermarket developments that have taken place throughout Boston’s
neighborhoods. Twenty-three new or expanded supermarkets have opened in Boston’s neighborhoods since
1992. Eight of these have opened in the past seven years.

Industrial Market and Recent Developments
According to “The Co-Star Industrial Report, Year-End 2007,” Boston and Suffolk County have 26.6
million square feet of industrial space. As of December 2007, there was 3.6 million square feet of industrial
space vacant, a vacancy rate of 13.4%, with―276,656 square feet of absorption over the year. The average
rent for quality industrial space was estimated to range from $8.09 per square-foot (triple net) for
warehouse space, and $17.70 for flex space.
Within Boston Marine Industrial Park, Boston’s largest site for manufacturing located on the seaport
in South Boston, 2008 brought a series of developments. The Central Parking Garage was expanded from
1,400 to 1,700 cars. Phase two of the International Cargo Center was permitted although demolition of the
site has not yet begun. Permits are now in place for a new 500,000 square foot development on Massport
Marine terminal, a thirty acre site. Ground breaking is anticipated in 2009 for the first building of 150,000
square feet. Also, F.J. O’Hara is beginning a 7,000 square foot expansion of their seafood processing and
distribution facility at New Boston Seafood. Elsewhere, Global Protection is expanding from 10,000 square
feet to 35,000 square feet of occupancy at 12 Channel Street. In addition, at Drydock #3, Boston Ship
Repair is expanding by 30,000 square feet and merging with Atlantic Marine in anticipation of a 30%
increase in ship repair activity. At 7 Tide Street Reflex Lighting purchased the 36,000 square foot lease
formerly the location of Boston Thermo King.
The BRA’s Back Streets Program, established in 2001, continues to attract, retain, and grow Boston’s
viable industrial and commercial businesses and their diverse job base through the strategic use of land,
workforce and financial resources. In 2008 Back Streets successfully assisted 40 companies, retained 455
jobs, and created over 100 new jobs. Back Streets helped companies like Dancing Deer, Ambit Press,
Boston Green Building, Olive Nation and Intralinks expand in Boston. These companies alone account for
over 100,000 square feet of new space in the City as well as account for over 100 new jobs. By working
with Back Streets, these programs had access to financing options, real estate expansion sites, workforce
development and permitting assistance. Back Streets guided Dancing Deer Backing Company to 65
Sprague Street in Hyde Park for their expansion needs where they are occupying 47,500 square feet of
space. Back Streets recruited Ambit Press to Boston where they purchased a building at 131 N. Beacon
Street in Allston and are now occupying 25,000 square feet of space. Also, Back Streets referred
OliveNation.com to Charlestown Commerce center where they are occupying 2,500 square feet of space.
In addition, Intralinks, an industrial company expanded to 20,000 square feet in the Schraffts Center in
Charlestown through assistance by the Back Streets program.
In 2008 Back Streets placed a strategic focus on the Newmarket Industrial Area. Strategically located
at the crossroads of Boston’s highways on the periphery of Downtown Boston, Newmarket is a vital center
of Boston’s wholesale trade and related industrial business vital to many downtown companies. Newmarket
area businesses currently employ over 11,000 people and generate over $3 billion in sales every year.
Moving people and commerce is critical to the success of area businesses, and Back Streets has been
instrumental in researching, proposing, and aiding the execution of several enhancements to the area,
including an application for infrastructure improvements utilizing potential Public Works Economic
Development grant funding. Future plans for the district involve working with departments across the city
to enhance parking, infrastructure and transportation.
Housing Stock, Housing Values, and Development
The U.S. Bureau of the Census reported on some characteristics of the City’s housing stock in April
2000. The total of 250,863 units grew by 1,072 from 1990, the date of the previous decennial census. The
composition of occupied housing has been changing. The number of occupied rental apartments increased
between 1990 and 2000, going from 157,920 to 162,302, a gain of 4,382 or 2.8%. The number of owneroccupied units also increased between 1990 and 2000, going from 70,544 to 77,226, a gain of 6,682 or
9.5%. Condominium units increased from about 4,500 in 1980 to over 38,000 in 2000. Public and publicly
assisted housing totaled 49,868 units constituting over 19% of the City’s housing stock. The percentage of
owner to renter occupied units between 1990 and 2000 went from 30.9%/69.1% to 32.2%/67.8%. With the
small addition of new units and the large gain in occupied units the number of vacant units dropped from
22,399 in 1990 to 12,407 in 2000 while the vacancy rate for owner and renter housing fell from 2.6% and
7.8%, respectively, in 1990 to 1.0% and 3.0%, respectively, in 2000.
A report on 2008 real estate trends done by the City’s Department of Neighborhood Development
23

Less than ten sales of data are not deemed to be reliable.

Note 1:
The prices in the above table exempt all sales of properties of less than $25,000 because the low price sales are not
considered to be “arms-length” transactions and the high price sales can distort averages.
Note 2:
Data in the above table does not include “paired-sales” so the size, quality and type of houses sold vary from year-to-year.
Note 3:
Sales volume eliminates those sales mentioned in note 1 and also eliminate sales for properties that were not able to be
accurately “geo-coded” for location so actual neighborhood and citywide totals are higher.

Condominium sales volume and prices also showed diversity across the neighborhoods of Boston in
2007 and 2008. The three most expensive neighborhoods for condominiums (median price greater than
$521,000) were the Central (comprising Downtown, the North End, the West End, and the Waterfront),and
the Back Bay/Beacon Hill and South End neighborhoods, which all together form the core residential
pockets closest to downtown. Four neighborhoods had moderately priced condominiums (median price
between $340,000 and $412,000): Charlestown, South Boston, Jamaica Plain and Fenway/Kenmore. Eight
neighborhoods still had lower condominium median prices (with medians of $275,000 or below):
Allston/Brighton, Dorchester, East Boston, Hyde Park, Mattapan, Roslindale, Roxbury, and West Roxbury.
The median citywide condominium price as of calendar Year 2008 was $370,000, up 4% in price from
those of calendar year 2007. Sales volume declined by 20%.

City of Boston, Department of Neighborhood Development, February 2009, Real Estate Trends, 2008.

During the last two years, as a result of the problems nationally in housing markets due to the
prevalence of sub-prime loans, the issue of foreclosures has become noteworthy and relevant to the
discussion of housing markets. Boston has seen some rise in the amount of foreclosures, and the following
table provides details at the City and neighborhood levels for 2007 and 2008. While deeds to foreclose (the
first step in the foreclosure process) went up by 73% from 703 to 1,215, the petitions to foreclose (the final
step in the foreclosure process) went down by 22% from 2,432 to 1,900 because of successful City of
Boston programs to slow and control the foreclosure crisis. Neighborhoods with the most foreclosure
problems in 2008 were: Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, Hyde Park and East Boston. Despite these
problems, metropolitan Boston in 2008 ranked 44th worst out of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the
percentage of foreclosure activity, as related to total housing units, at 1.77%. Massachusetts had a
foreclosure rate of 1.64%; and the U.S. rate was 1.84%.

City of Boston, Department of Neighborhood Development, February 2009.

The Boston Housing Authority (“BHA”) is a public agency that provides subsidized housing to lowand moderate-income individuals and families. The Authority administers two distinct housing programs.
First, the Authority manages conventional public housing within the City of Boston. The Authority owns
60 developments, a few of which have both state and federal components and has also participated in the
mixed-finance redevelopment of five of its developments. The BHA owns and manages some scattered site
properties throughout the City of Boston as well. Of the 60 developments, 36 are designated as
elderly/disabled developments and 24 are designated as family developments. Two of the 24 family
developments have elderly/disabled housing on site and one of the elderly developments has designated
units for families. The BHA currently owns and/or oversees approximately 14,000 units of housing in
Boston and houses about 27,000 people under the public housing program. In addition, the Authority
administers approximately 12,500 tenant-based rental assistance vouchers that allow families to rent in the
private market and apply a subsidy to their rent. The BHA also subsidizes about 1,330 additional
apartments through the Section 8 Project Based Voucher and Moderate Rehabilitation programs. Through
this assistance, residents are able to pay approximately 30-40 percent of their income toward rent and the
BHA pays the remainder. The BHA helps provide housing to approximately 25,000 people under this
program. See “Large Public Sector Projects” for BHA development activity.
Boston uses tools such as zoning and inclusionary development to successfully produce artist space.
Both artist live/work and artist work-only space is being made permanent by the work of the BRA’s Artist
Space Initiative to support the work of creative entrepreneurs. More than 1,000 artists of many disciplines
have submitted their portfolio documentation to be eligible for future artists’ space as it is developed.
Artist units are in planning and development in many different Boston neighborhoods. In 2008, four new
artist live/work spaces on Congress Street in Fort Point were sold to BRA Certified Artists. In addition,
twenty-two additional new artist units are contemplated in a building in that same neighborhood, as
additional residential and office redevelopment projects bring new investment to Fort Point. In Hyde Park,
62 new artist units are under construction and will be offered for sale starting later this year. Artist units are
currently in the permitting process in South Boston, Roxbury, East Boston, Mission Hill and Hyde Park.
Twenty-six permanent affordable artist live/work units were recently occupied by artists in the South End
at Artblock, along with affordable work studios and nonprofit arts organization space. These developments
have brought the total number of permanent artist units created through the BRA’s Artist Space Initiative to
165. Additionally, 118 more artists units are now in planning and development in the South Boston, Hyde
Park, and Lower Roxbury neighborhoods.

29

Housing construction accelerated between 2000 and 2008 with the Leading The Way I and II housing
strategy plans – Boston’s comprehensive strategy for intensive housing construction. The City has counted
17,047 housing units completed from 2000 through 2008 including more than 5,418 new “affordable rate”
units. Over 7,000 households were protected from displacement through City efforts to prevent their
subsidized apartments from becoming market-rate. Currently in construction are 2,967 total units while 855
more units are in developments which are designated “pre-construction” (permitted but physical
construction yet to begin). When completed Boston’s Leading the Way production will total 19,592
housing units added. Virtually all of the Boston Housing Authority’s vacant units have been reclaimed to
create new housing, particularly for the homeless.
The Boston Redevelopment Authority has approved 35 different private-sector housing developments
around the City, both downtown and in the neighborhoods, with 3,048 new housing units that are presently
under construction (2609) or in pre-construction (439). In addition, many more developments, both those
approved by the City’s Department of Neighborhood Development and those with only private building
permits are under construction.

The Linkage Program
The City implemented its development linkage program in 1983 in order to direct some of the
benefits of downtown investment to the building of affordable housing in its neighborhoods through the
Neighborhood Housing Trust (NHT). The linkage program also funds job training for City residents
through the Neighborhood Jobs Trust (NJT). Under the linkage program, which was amended in 1986 and
again in 2001, real estate developers seeking approval of large scale commercial or institutional
developments are required to enter into agreements obligating them to pay exactions in the amount of $9.44
per square-foot of construction over 100,000 square feet, of which $1.57 per square-foot goes to the job
training fund and $7.87 per square-foot goes for affordable housing purposes. The fee was last adjusted as
of March 9, 2006.
Linkage payments to the NHT are amortized over a period of either seven or twelve years, depending
on the date of the initial agreement. Under NHT policy, current agreements provide for a seven-year
payment period. The seven-member NHT board holds public hearings and has the authority to approve
linkage grants to selected projects, except for a separate “housing creation” option, which requires the
additional approval by the BRA. Since the inception of the linkage program through December 2008, the
NHT has awarded $112 million in grant funds to various affordable housing projects.
Based on data through 2008, NHT funding contributed to the complete or pending construction or
renovation of 9,766 housing units in 160 projects in the City’s neighborhoods. Affordable housing units for
low and moderate-income residents comprise 82% (8,031 units) of this total. Of these 160 housing
developments created, linkage funds, for the most part, account for fewer than 6% of the total development
costs of the projects. NHT grant awards are allocated to fund low and moderate-income housing through
the renovation of old buildings and schools, as well as to assist in the creation of new housing. Projects
have included rental units; single room occupancy units, such as housing for pregnant, homeless women
and alcohol recovery programs; condominiums; housing cooperatives; and home ownership.
Between fiscal years 1988 and 2008 over $20 million of funds were committed to the job training
component of the City’s linkage program and over $17 million of funds had been awarded to a broad range
of community-based job training and adult education programs. Services funded under this program
include: model program designs for entry-level job training, adult education, English for Speakers of Other
Languages, and workplace-based education. The NJT is particularly interested in supporting innovative
education and training activities which result in high-wage employment, new or non-traditional
employment opportunities, and community-based projects that respond to specific neighborhoods’
documented education and training needs. The NJT is committed to providing appropriate services to the
residents of neighborhoods where, or adjacent to where, a given development project is located, while also
ensuring that residents throughout the City have access to new jobs resulting from development.

APPENDIX C

March 18, 2009

Lisa C. Signori
Director of Administration and Finance
and Collector-Treasurer
City of Boston
Boston, Massachusetts
Re: City of Boston, Massachusetts
General Obligation Bonds, 2009 Series A and 2009 Series B
We have acted as Bond Counsel to the City of Boston, Massachusetts (the “City”), in connection
with the issuance by the City of $100,000,000 General Obligation Bonds, 2009 Series A (the
“Series A Bonds”), and $8,940,000 General Obligation Bonds, 2009 Series B (the “Series B
Bonds” and, together with the Series A Bonds, the “Bonds”), dated the date hereof. In such
capacity, we have examined the law and such certified proceedings and other papers as we have
deemed necessary to render this opinion.
As to questions of fact material to our opinion we have relied upon representations and
covenants of the City contained in the certified proceedings and other certifications of public
officials furnished to us, without undertaking to verify the same by independent investigation.
Based on this examination, we are of the opinion, under existing law, as follows:
(1)
The Bonds are valid and binding general obligations of the City and, except to the
extent they are paid from other sources, the principal of and interest on the Bonds are payable
from taxes which may be levied without limitation as to rate or amount upon all taxable property
in the City.
(2)
Interest on the Bonds is excluded from the gross income of the owners of the
Bonds for federal income tax purposes. In addition, interest on the Bonds is not a specific
preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes
and interest on the Series A Bonds is not included in adjusted current earnings when calculating
corporate alternative minimum taxable income. However, interest on the Series B Bonds is
included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable
income. In rendering the opinions set forth in this paragraph, we have assumed compliance by
the City with all requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that must be satisfied
subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that interest thereon be, and continue to be,
BOS111 12352893. 2

C-1

excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The City has covenanted to
comply with all such requirements. Failure by the City to comply with certain of such
requirements may cause the interest on the Bonds to become included in gross income for federal
income tax purposes retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds. We express no opinion
regarding any other federal tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds.
(3)
The interest on the Bonds is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes
and the Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property taxes. We express no opinion
regarding any other Massachusetts tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds or any tax
consequences arising with respect to the Bonds under the laws of any state other than
Massachusetts.
This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we neither assume nor undertake any
obligation to update, revise, supplement or restate this opinion to reflect any action taken or
omitted, or any facts or circumstances or changes in law or in the interpretation thereof, that may
hereafter arise or occur, or for any other reason.
The rights of the holders of the Bonds and the enforceability of the Bonds may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’
rights heretofore or hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable, and their
enforcement may also be subject to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases.

SECTION 8. Amendment; Waiver. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Disclosure
Certificate, the City may amend this Disclosure Certificate and any provision of this Disclosure
Certificate may be waived if such amendment or waiver is permitted by the Rule, as evidenced by
an opinion of counsel expert in federal securities law (which may include bond counsel to the City),

the Rule. The first Annual Report filed after enactment of any amendment to or waiver of this
Disclosure Certificate shall explain, in narrative form, the reasons for the amendment or waiver and
the impact of the change in the type of information being provided in the Annual Report.
If the amendment provides for a change in the accounting principles to be followed in
preparing financial statements, the Annual Report for the year in which the change is made shall
present a comparison between the financial statements or information prepared on the basis of the
new accounting principles and those prepared on the basis of the former accounting principles. The
comparison shall include a qualitative discussion of the differences in the accounting principles and
the impact of the change in the accounting principles on the presentation of the financial
information in order to provide information to investors to enable them to evaluate the ability of the
City to meet its obligations. To the extent reasonably feasible, the comparison shall also be
quantitative. The City will give notice, or will cause the Dissemination Agent to give notice, of the
change in the accounting principles to each Repository.
SECTION 9. Default. In the event of a failure of the City to comply with any provision of
this Disclosure Certificate any Owner of the Bonds may seek a court order for specific performance
by the City of its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate. A default under this Disclosure
Certificate shall not constitute a default with respect to the Bonds, and the sole remedy under this
Disclosure Certificate in the event of any failure of the City to comply with this Disclosure
Certificate shall be an action for specific performance of the City's obligations hereunder and not for
money damages in any amount.
