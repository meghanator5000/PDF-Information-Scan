In the opinion of Locke Lord LLP, as successor by merger to Edwards Wildman Palmer LLP, Bond Counsel, based upon an analysis
of existing law and assuming, among other matters, compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Series A Bonds and the Series B Bonds
(together, the “Bonds”) is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Interest on
the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes, although such
interest is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable income. Under existing law,
interest on all of the Bonds is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal
property taxes. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the
accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds. See “Tax Exemption” herein.

OFFICIAL STATEMENT
of the
CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
relating to
$140,000,000
GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS, 2015 SERIES A
$126,735,000
GENERAL OBLIGATION REFUNDING BONDS, 2015 SERIES B

This Official Statement (which includes the cover page and Appendices hereto) provides information
concerning the City of Boston, Massachusetts (the “City”), the $140,000,000 General Obligation Bonds, 2015 Series
A (the “Series A Bonds”) and the $126,735,000 General Obligation Refunding Bonds, 2015 Series B (the “Series B
Bonds” and together with the Series A Bonds, the “Bonds”), to be issued by the City as described herein. Certain
credit factors concerning the Bonds are described throughout this Official Statement, which should be read in its
entirety. This Official Statement speaks only as of its date and the information contained herein is subject to change
after this date.
THE CITY
The City of Boston, incorporated as a town in 1630 and as a city in 1822, is the largest city in Massachusetts
and the capital of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Commonwealth”). The City and its component
governmental units are responsible for the provision of a wide range of government services, including education,
public safety, public health, urban planning and development and the maintenance of the City’s infrastructure, and
for funding certain employee benefits, state authority assessments and debt service requirements. Its primary sources
of revenue are property taxes, state aid and certain excises. Management of the City’s finances includes preparation
of annual operating and capital budgets, the exercise of expenditure controls and cash management. For a full
discussion concerning the City, and its finances, see “Appendix A—City of Boston, Massachusetts, Information
Statement dated March 1, 2015 (the “Information Statement”).
As the economic hub of New England, Boston is a center for professional, financial, higher educational and
medical services, and the focus of tourist and convention travel in New England. For a description of certain
demographic and economic information about the City, see “Appendix A—Exhibit III—City of Boston—Selected
Demographic and Economic Information.”
SECURITY FOR THE BONDS
The Bonds will be valid general obligations of the City, for the payment of the principal of and interest on
which the full faith and credit of the City will be pledged. To the extent not paid from other legally available
revenues of the City, the Bonds are payable from ad valorem taxes which may be levied upon all taxable property in
the City without limit as to rate or amount.
Chapter 643 of the Acts of 1983 of the Commonwealth, as amended (the “Bond Procedure Act of 1983”),
requires that the debt and interest charges on all general obligation indebtedness of the City (including the Bonds), if
not otherwise provided for, be included in the City’s annual tax levy. The Bond Procedure Act of 1983 also
mandates assessment of taxes in excess of the levy limits imposed by the statewide property tax limit (“Proposition
2½”) to the extent that the debt service on City obligations is not otherwise provided for in the tax levy or from other
sources, with no allowance made for any other expenditures of the City. See “City Revenues—Property Taxes—
Proposition 2½” in the Information Statement. Holders of City obligations do not have a statutory priority with
respect to or a security interest in the portion of the tax levy attributable to such obligations. See “City
Indebtedness—Classification of City Debt” in the Information Statement.
In the opinion of Bond Counsel, the City is subject to suit on the Bonds, and courts of competent jurisdiction
have power in appropriate proceedings to order payment of a judgment on the Bonds from available funds or, in the
absence of available funds, to order the inclusion of the required amount in the next annual tax levy. In exercising
their discretion as to whether to enter such an order, the courts could take into account all relevant factors, including
the current operating needs of the City and the availability and adequacy of other remedies. The Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court has stated in the past that a judgment against a municipality can be enforced by the taking
and sale of property of any inhabitant. There has been no judicial determination, however, as to whether the remedy
is constitutional under current due process and equal protection standards.
Payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds is not secured by or limited to a pledge of any particular
revenue source of the City. Chapter 190 of the Acts of 1982 of the Commonwealth (the “1982 Funding Loan Act”)

1

and the Bond Procedure Act of 1983 authorize the City to pledge to the payment of any of its general obligation
notes or bonds all or any part of the revenues of the City derived from any tax, fee, distribution or reimbursement
payable to the City (except distributions and reimbursements required by law to be specifically used for statutorily
defined purposes), including state aid distributions and the proceeds of the City’s annual property tax levy. No
obligations are currently outstanding which are secured by such a pledge. The Bond Procedure Act of 1983 also
authorizes the City to issue special obligation bonds payable solely from the revenues of a revenue-producing
facility, and Chapter 152 of the Acts of 1997, as amended (the “Convention Center Act”), authorizes the City to
pledge certain excise receipts and other revenues of the City to the payment of bonds of the City issued under the
authority of the Convention Center Act. As of the date of this Official Statement, no special obligation indebtedness
of the City remains outstanding. See “City Indebtedness—Special Obligation Debt” in the Information Statement.
To the extent required for the payment of any such secured indebtedness, the revenues pledged to their payment
would not be available to pay the Bonds.
Except to the extent specifically pledged to the payment of certain indebtedness, state aid distributions to the
City are generally available for the payment of bonds or notes of the City, but, under certain circumstances, they
may be unavailable to the extent such distributions are applied to the payment of “qualified bonds” issued by the
City (none of which bonds have been issued), or to the extent that such distributions may be applied under state law
to the satisfaction of unpaid assessments due the Commonwealth from the City for debt issued by the Massachusetts
Bay Transportation Authority, or for obligations of the City or of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission issued to
the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust, formerly known as Massachusetts Water Pollution Abatement Trust. See
“City Indebtedness—Classification of City Debt” in the Information Statement.
State statutes also provide that certain parking meter receipts may be used only for parking and related
purposes and, accordingly, monies derived from this source may be unavailable to pay general obligation bonds and
notes issued for other purposes. In addition, subject to certain limits, the City may annually authorize the
establishment of one or more revolving funds in connection with the use of certain revenues for programs that
produce those revenues. If it accepts certain statutory provisions, the City may also establish enterprise funds for
certain purposes, including for a health care, solid waste, recreational or transportation facility, and for police or fire
services. Under those provisions any surplus in the fund is restricted to use for capital expenditures or reduction of
user charges. The City has not established any such revolving funds or enterprise funds.
Section 19A of Chapter 44 of the General Laws provides, in part, that if the City is or is likely to be unable to
pay principal of or interest on any of its bonds or notes when due, it shall notify the state Commissioner of Revenue.
The Commissioner shall certify such inability to the State Treasurer. The State Treasurer shall pay the due or
overdue amount by the later of three days after the certification or one business day prior to the due date. This
payment is limited, however, to the estimated amounts distributable by the Commonwealth to the City during the
remainder of the fiscal year. If, for any reason, any portion of the certified sum has not been paid at the end of the
fiscal year, the State Treasurer shall pay it as soon as practicable in the next fiscal year to the extent of the estimated
distributions for such fiscal year. The sums so paid shall be charged with interest and administrative costs against the
distributions to the City. The foregoing provisions are not a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth. The
Commonwealth has not agreed to maintain existing levels of state distributions and the law requiring the
Commonwealth to use estimated distributions to pay debt service may be subject to repeal by future legislation.
Moreover, adoption of the state’s annual appropriation act is often delayed beyond the beginning of the fiscal year,
and estimated distributions which are subject to appropriation may be unavailable to pay local debt service until they
are appropriated.
The rights of the holders of the Bonds and the enforceability of payment of the Bonds may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights heretofore or
hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable and their enforcement may also be subject to the exercise
of judicial discretion in appropriate cases. Massachusetts municipalities are not currently authorized by the
Massachusetts General Laws to file a petition for bankruptcy under federal bankruptcy laws.

THE BONDS
Description
The Bonds will be dated the date of delivery thereof, expected to be April 1, 2015, and will mature on April 1
of the years, and in the amounts, and will bear interest calculated on the basis of 30-day months and a 360-day year
at the rates, shown on the inside cover of this Official Statement. Interest on the Bonds will be payable on October
1, 2015 and semiannually thereafter on each April 1 and October 1, provided that if such day is not a business day,
interest will be payable on the next business day.
The Bonds will be issued by means of a book-entry system, with bond certificates immobilized at The
Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). Bond certificates will not be available for distribution
to the public and will evidence ownership of the Bonds in principal amounts of $5,000 or integral multiples thereof,
with transfers of ownership effected on the records of DTC and its participants pursuant to rules and procedures
established by DTC and its participants. Interest on the Bonds will be paid on the interest payment dates or upon
redemption, and principal of the Bonds will be paid at maturity or upon redemption, to DTC or its nominee as
registered owner of the Bonds. Transfer of principal or redemption price and interest payments to participants of
DTC will be the responsibility of DTC; transfer of principal or redemption price and interest payments to beneficial
owners by participants of DTC will be the responsibility of such participants and other nominees of beneficial
owners. The record date for principal or redemption price and interest payments will be the fifteenth day of the
month next preceding a debt service payment date or, if such day is not a business day, the next succeeding business
day. The City will not be responsible or liable for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records maintained by
DTC, its participants or persons acting through such participants.
U.S. Bank National Association, Boston, Massachusetts, will act as paying agent for the Bonds (the “Paying
Agent”).
Authorization and Purpose
The Bonds will be issued pursuant to Chapter 643 of the Acts of 1983 of the Commonwealth, as amended, and
various loan orders of the City Council approved by the Mayor. The Series A Bonds will be issued to finance
various capital projects of the City. The Series B Bonds will be issued for the purpose of current and advance
refunding certain outstanding general obligation bonds, as more fully described under “Plan of Refunding,” below.
Redemption Prior To Maturity
Optional Redemption
The Bonds maturing on or before April 1, 2025 will not be subject to redemption prior to maturity. The Bonds
maturing after April 1, 2025 will be subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option of the City, on or after
April 1, 2025, as a whole or in part at any time, in such order of maturity as the City may determine and by lot
within each maturity as selected by DTC and its participants, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of
the Bonds to be redeemed, plus accrued interest to the redemption date.
Notice of Redemption
Notice of redemption of Bonds, specifying the numbers, series and maturities of the Bonds or portions thereof
to be redeemed and the redemption date, will be given by the Paying Agent not less than 30 days prior to the
redemption date by notice mailed to DTC or its nominee, as registered owner of the Bonds to be redeemed. The City
will not be responsible for mailing notices of redemption to anyone other than DTC or its nominee. Notice having
been given, the Bonds or portions thereof called for redemption will become due and payable on the designated
redemption date. If on the redemption date monies are available for the redemption of the Bonds or portions thereof
to be redeemed, together with interest accrued to the redemption date, then interest on such Bonds or portions
thereof shall thereafter cease to accrue.
Book-Entry Transfer System
DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds. The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities
registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an
authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of each
series of the Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of that maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.

3

DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New
York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the
Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code,
and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and
municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct
Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales
and other securities transactions, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and
pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC, is the holding company for DTC, National, and
Securities Clearing Corporation, and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing
agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated securities. Access to the DTC system is also available to
others as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly
(“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants
are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at
www.dtcc.com and www.dtc.org.
Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive
a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial
Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive
written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written
confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or
Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership
interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting
on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership
interests in the Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.
To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the
name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an authorized
representative of DTC. The deposit of the Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such
other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual
Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts
such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will
remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.
Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to
Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by
arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.
Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within a maturity of a series are being
redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such
maturity to be redeemed.
Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the Bonds
unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI procedures. Under its usual procedures,
DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the City as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede
& Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Bonds are credited on the
record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).
Principal or redemption price and interest payments on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or such other
nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct
Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the City or the
Paying Agent on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments
by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the
case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the
responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC or, its nominee, the Paying Agent, or the City, subject to any
statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal or redemption price

4

and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is
the responsibility of the City or the Paying Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants shall be the
responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners shall be the responsibility of
Direct and Indirect Participants.
DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by
giving reasonable notice to the City or the Paying Agent. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor
securities depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered to DTC.
The City may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a
successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certificates will be printed and delivered.
The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from
sources that the City believes to be reliable, but the City takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.
PLAN OF REFUNDING
Series B Bonds
The Series B Bonds are being issued to: (i) current refund, at par, the City’s outstanding general obligation
2005 Series A Bonds (the “Current Refunded Bonds”), as further described below, and (ii) advance refund, at par, a
portion of the City’s outstanding general obligation 2006 Series A Bonds, a portion of the City’s outstanding general

Copyright, American Bankers Association. CUSIP data herein are provided by Standard & Poor’s, CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of
The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. The CUSIP numbers listed above are being provided solely for the convenience of bondholders only at
the time of issuance of the Bonds and the City does not make any representation with respect to such numbers or undertake any
responsibility for their accuracy now or at any time in the future.

The refunding of the Refunded Bonds or any other bonds of the City is subject to market conditions at the time
of sale of the Bonds. The City reserves the right to refund any or all of the Refunded Bonds or to refund any other
bonds of the City or not to refund and such bonds at this time.
Upon delivery of the Series B Bonds, the City will enter into a Refunding Escrow Agreement (the “Escrow
Agreement”) with U.S. Bank National Association, Boston, Massachusetts, as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”) to
provide for the refunding of the Advance Refunded Bonds. Upon receipt of the proceeds of the Series B Bonds, the
City will transfer a portion of such proceeds to the Escrow Agent for deposit in a Refunding Escrow Fund
established under the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will invest such amount in direct obligations of the
United States of America or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America
(“Governmental Obligations”) maturing in amounts and on dates, and bearing interest at rates, sufficient without
reinvestment to pay when due the interest on, and upon redemption, the outstanding principal of, the Advance
Refunded Bonds. The Refunding Escrow Fund, including the interest earnings on the Government Obligations, is
pledged for the benefit of the holders of the Advance Refunded Bonds. The portion of the proceeds of the Series B
Bonds to be applied to the refunding of the Current Refunded Bonds will be deposited by the City into the General
Fund until used to redeem the Current Refunded Bonds.
Verification of Mathematical Accuracy
Robert Thomas, CPA, LLC will verify from information provided to them the mathematical accuracy as of the
date of the closing on the Bonds, of (i) the computation contained in the provided schedules to determine that the
anticipated receipts from the Government Obligations and cash deposits, to be held in escrow, will be sufficient to
pay, when due, the principal of and interest on the Advance Refunded Bonds, and (ii) the computation of yield on
the Government Obligations contained in provided schedules used by Bond Counsel in its determination that the
interest on such Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Robert Thomas, CPA, LLC
will express no opinion on the assumptions provided to them, nor as to the exemption from taxation of the interest
on the Series B Bonds.

LITIGATION
No litigation is pending or, to the knowledge of the City’s Corporation Counsel, threatened (a) seeking to
restrain or enjoin the issuance or delivery of the Bonds, (b) contesting or affecting any authority for or the validity of
the Bonds, (c) contesting the power of the City to issue the Bonds or the power of the City to offer and sell the
Bonds to the purchaser(s) thereof, (d) contesting the power of the City to levy and collect taxes to pay the Bonds, (e)
contesting the corporate existence or boundaries of the City, or (f) contesting the title of officials of the City who
have acted with respect to the proceedings for the issuance and sale of the Bonds to their respective offices.
There are pending in courts within the Commonwealth various suits in which the City is a defendant. No
litigation is pending or threatened which is likely to result, either individually or in the aggregate, in final judgments
against the City which would affect materially its ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds when due
or which would affect materially its financial condition.
Telecommunications providers, Verizon and RCN have filed appeals with the Appellate Tax Board (“ATB”)
for fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, claiming that Boston and other Massachusetts cities and towns that classify their tax
rates have disproportionately assessed the tax on their personal property in violation of the Massachusetts
Constitution. The companies are challenging Chapter 40, section 56 of the Massachusetts General Laws, which was
enacted after a 1978 amendment to the state constitution that provided for the current system of classified tax rates
for residential and business property. The ATB heard the companies’ arguments for fiscal 2012 and 2013 and
rejected them, finding in favor of the City in October 2014. This matter will not be ripe for appeal until the ATB
issues its findings. It is expected that the companies will appeal this decision.
The companies, together, would receive abatements totaling approximately $3.6 million for each year, if they
prevail. Moreover, a decision in the companies’ favor would lower the tax rate for all personal property taxpayers
going forward. This would not impact the amount of future revenue that could be raised by the City, but would
adversely impact the tax rates for residential properties, since their share of the levy is statutorily dependent upon the
portion of the total levy that personal property owners pay. It should be noted that while the Supreme Judicial Court,
in response to a request for an opinion by the House of Representatives, affirmed the constitutionality of the act on
which Chapter 40, section 56 is based in 1979, the City cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
TAX EXEMPTION
In the opinion of Locke Lord LLP, as successor by merger to Edwards Wildman Palmer LLP, Bond Counsel
to the City (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings, and court decisions, and
assuming, among other matters, compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”). Bond
Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the
federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes, although Bond Counsel observes that such interest is
included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable income. Bond
Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other federal tax consequences arising with respect to the ownership or
disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds.
The Code imposes various requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax
purposes of interest on obligations such as the Bonds. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in
interest on the Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of
original issuance of the Bonds. The City has covenanted to comply with such requirements to ensure that interest on
the Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes compliance with
these requirements.
Bond Counsel is also of the opinion that, under existing law, interest on the Bonds is exempt from
Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property taxes. Bond
Counsel has not opined as to other Massachusetts tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds. Prospective
Bondholders should be aware, however, that the Bonds are included in the measure of Massachusetts estate and
inheritance taxes, and the Bonds and the interest thereon are included in the measure of certain Massachusetts
corporate excise and franchise taxes. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion as to the taxability of the Bonds or the
income therefrom or any other tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds under the laws of any state other
than Massachusetts.
A complete copy of the proposed form of the opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to the Bonds is set forth in
Appendix B hereto.

To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at maturity of such
Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the term of the Bonds), the
difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the accrual of which, to the extent properly allocable to each owner
thereof, is treated as interest on such Bonds which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes
and is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes. For this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of
the Bonds is the first price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of the Bonds is sold to the public
(excluding bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters,
placement agents or wholesalers). The original issue discount with respect to any maturity of the Bonds accrues
daily over the term to maturity of such Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded semiannually
(with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The accruing original issue discount is added to the
adjusted basis of such Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon disposition (including sale, redemption, or
payment on maturity) of such Bonds. Bondholders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax
consequences of ownership of the Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of purchasers who do
not purchase such Bonds in the original offering to the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such
Bonds is sold to the public.
Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount greater than the stated principal
amount to be paid at maturity of such Bonds, or, in some cases, at the earlier redemption date of such Bonds
(“Premium Bonds”), will be treated as having amortizable bond premium for federal income tax purposes and
Massachusetts personal income tax purposes. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the
case of obligations, such as the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes. However, a Bondholder’s basis in a Premium Bond will be reduced by the amount of
amortizable bond premium properly allocable to such Bondholder. Holders of Premium Bonds should consult their
own tax advisors with respect to the proper treatment of amortizable bond premium in their particular circumstances.
Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not
taken) or events occurring (or not occurring) after the date of issuance of the Bonds may adversely affect the value
of, or the tax status of interest on, the Bonds.
Prospective Bondholders should be aware that from time to time legislation is or may be proposed which, if
enacted into law, could result in interest on the Bonds being subject directly or indirectly to federal income taxation,
or otherwise prevent Bondholders from realizing the full benefit provided under current federal tax law of the
exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross income. To date, no such legislation has been enacted into law.
However, it is not possible to predict whether any such legislation will be enacted into law. Further, no assurance
can be given that any pending or future legislation, including amendments to the Code, if enacted into law, or any
proposed legislation, including amendments to the Code, or any future judicial, regulatory or administrative
interpretation or development with respect to existing law, will not adversely affect the market value and
marketability of, or the tax status of interest on, the Bonds. Prospective Bondholders are urged to consult their own
tax advisors with respect to any such legislation, interpretation or development.
Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes and is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or
the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds may otherwise affect the federal or state tax liability of a Bondholder.
Among other possible consequences of ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the
Bonds, the Code requires recipients of certain social security and certain railroad retirement benefits to take into
account receipts or accruals of interest on the Bonds in determining the portion of such benefits that are included in
gross income. The nature and extent of all such other tax consequences will depend upon the particular tax status of
the Bondholder or the Bondholder’s other items of income, deduction or exclusion. Bond Counsel expresses no
opinion regarding any such other tax consequences and Bondholders should consult with their own tax advisors with
respect to such consequences.
CREDIT RATINGS
Moody’s Investors Service Inc., (“Moody’s”), 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York,
New York, and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, a division of McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (“Standard &
Poor’s”), 55 Water Street, New York, New York, have assigned the ratings of “Aaa” and “AAA,” respectively, to
the Bonds, reflecting the City’s capacity to pay debt service. Such ratings reflect only the views of such
organizations and any desired explanation of the significance of such ratings should be obtained from the rating
agency furnishing the same. Generally, a rating agency bases its rating on the information and materials furnished to
it and on investigations, studies and assumptions of it own. There is no assurance that any such ratings will continue

9

for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely by the rating
agency concerned, if in the judgment of such rating agency, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision
or withdrawal of any such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Bonds.

A description of certain City principal governmental services follows:
Schools
The City’s School Department provides both basic education and college preparatory curricula as
well as specialized vocational educational programs. The school system enrolled approximately 57,000
students for the 2014-2015 school year, roughly the same as the previous year.
Pursuant to Chapter 108 of the Acts of 1992, the City’s public schools are under the control of a
School Committee, which consists of seven members appointed by the Mayor. Members of the School
Committee have staggered four-year terms. In addition to appointing the Superintendent of Schools, the
Boston School Committee approves the School Department budget for submission to the Mayor, and by
and through the Superintendent, determines educational policy, makes all contracts for the purchase of
materials for the operations of the schools, and maintains and operates school properties. The
Superintendent of Schools has exclusive authority to make appointments and promotions for all teachers
and other School Department personnel except for the positions of Community Superintendent, Chairman,
Secretary, or Treasurer of the School Committee, and School Committee Administrative Assistants. The
School Committee appoints these excepted positions.
Public Safety
Public Safety is continuing to improve citywide service-delivery through consolidated and shared
resources to provide more effective and efficient public safety services to Boston’s communities.
The Boston Police Department maintains 11 neighborhood police stations and one headquarters
building. The Department also maintains 12 support locations, consisting of the Charlestown Neighborhood
Sub-Station, Police Academy, Firearms Training Range, Harbor Patrol Unit, Fleet Management Division,
Telecommunications Division, Evidence and Property Management Division, Special Operations Division,
Stress Support Unit, Recruit Investigation Unit, Field Support Division, and the K-9 unit.
A-6

The Fire Department maintains 40 facilities consisting of 34 neighborhood fire stations, one marine
unit, a training academy, a fire prevention division, a fire alarm division, a headquarters, a maintenance
division, a fire investigation building, and a high-pressure pumping station.
The Mayor’s Office of Emergency Management coordinates and directs Boston’s interdepartmental
and multi-jurisdictional homeland security activities by advising the Mayor on issues and obtaining and
managing outside funding.
Public Health
The Boston Public Health Commission (“BPHC”), successor to the City’s Department of Health and
Hospitals, is a body politic and corporate separate from the City created in 1996 when the operations of the
City’s former acute-care hospital, Boston City Hospital, were consolidated with the operations of Boston
University Medical Center Hospital under the control of the Boston Medical Center Corporation
(“BMCC”), a private, Massachusetts non-profit corporation. The BPHC is governed by a seven-member
board, six of whom are appointed by the Mayor, subject to confirmation by the City Council, and one of
whom, as the chief executive officer of BMCC, serves ex-officio. The BPHC functions as the City’s board
of health and operates a wide range of public health programs throughout the City funded from public and
private grants and City appropriations. The BPHC is a discretely presented component unit for GAAP
reporting purposes in the City’s annual audited financial statements. See “City Indebtedness—Debt of
Agencies Related to the City—Boston Public Health Commission.”
Public Works
The Public Works Department constructs and maintains highways, sidewalks, street lighting and
bridges, and oversees snow removal, street cleaning, refuse removal and recycling.
The Boston Water and Sewer Commission (“BWSC”), is an independent body politic and corporate
and a political subdivision of the Commonwealth created in July 1977, and is responsible for the operation
and maintenance of the City’s water, sewer, and storm water drainage systems, the construction of
improvements to those systems, and the collection of user charges for its services. See “City
Indebtedness—Debt of Agencies Related to the City—Boston Water and Sewer Commission” below.
Other Services
The Boston Public Library system is made up of the Central Library in Copley Square, 24 branches
throughout the City, a map center, business library, and a website filled with digital content and services.
The Parks and Recreation Department manages approximately 2,200 acres of active, passive and historic
parkland. The 2,200 acres of land include 272 parks, playgrounds, squares, malls, plazas, and other
miscellaneous sites; 16 historic and three active cemeteries; one greenhouse facility; and approximately
33,600 street trees.
Suffolk County
While existing state law provides that the Mayor and City Council serve as the Commissioners of
Suffolk County, which includes the cities of Boston, Chelsea, Revere and the Town of Winthrop, all of the
functions and costs of county government (including the county courts, registry of deeds and the Office of
the Suffolk County Sheriff) have been assumed by the Commonwealth, other than an annual assessment by
the Commonwealth for the purpose of funding the unfunded portion of pension liability for retirees of the
Office of the Suffolk County Sheriff who retired prior to January 1, 2010. This annual assessment can be
no greater than the City’s fiscal 2009 appropriation to support the Office of the Suffolk County Sheriff of
approximately $4.0 million, and will terminate when the pension liability of these retirees is fully funded.

Employee Relations
Under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 150E, most municipal employees in the Commonwealth
enjoy the right to join labor unions and bargain collectively over wages and other terms and conditions of
employment. The Office of Labor Relations represents the Mayor and the City in all collective bargaining
matters with all unions of City employees except School Department employee unions. The School
Department’s labor relations personnel similarly represent the School Committee and consult with the
Office of Labor Relations regarding contract negotiations and other general labor matters. Additionally, the
Office of Labor Relations has actively assisted the Boston Public Health Commission in collective
bargaining negotiations with its 11 bargaining units and regularly interfaces with the Boston Public Health
Commission on labor and employment matters.
Nearly all of the City’s non-school department employees are organized into bargaining units
represented by various unions. Most of these unions are affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Three large unions,
the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (“AFSCME”) Council 93 (laborer
employees), the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) Local 285 (clerical employees), and the
Salaried Employees of North America (“SENA”) Local 9158 (middle manager employees) represent the
majority of the City’s non-public safety employees.
Police officers are represented by four distinct unions: 1) the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association;
2) the Boston Police Superior Officers Federation; 3) the Boston Police Detectives Benevolent Society; and
4) the Boston Police Detectives Benevolent Society, Superior Officers Unit. Firefighters and Fire Chiefs
are divided into two bargaining units represented by a single union: the International Association of
Firefighters Local 718.
Boston teachers, teacher aides, school nurses, and substitutes are in a collective bargaining unit
represented by the Boston Teachers Union, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO.
The Boston Public Schools and the City of Boston maintain a contract with a private vendor to
provide bus transportation for City of Boston students who require transportation. The personnel costs
under this contract are passed through to the City and the City participates in the collective bargaining
negotiations between the vendor and its employees. The contract has expired and is under negotiation.
The table below represents a summary of the bargaining units representing City employees, the
number of City employees represented by each bargaining unit, and the status of the City’s contract with
each bargaining unit.

City of Boston Office of Budget Management, Boston Administrative Information Systems/Human Capital Management
(BAIS/HCM) and Boston School Department.

The City has settled with fourteen civilian unions in recent years that cover City departments, not
including the School Department or Public Health Commission, placing over 3,500 unionized employees
under contract. Each agreement is six years in duration and contains the same general wage pattern,
roughly 12% wage increases over six years. All of these unions agreed to new City-wide policies for
attendance, family and medical leave, military leave, and light duty. Bunker Hill Day and Evacuation Day
were deleted as contractual holidays. In addition, the City has settled twelve (12) contracts with School
Department unions. These agreements contain roughly the same general wage pattern as the rest of the
City’s civilian unions.
The City and the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association received an arbitration award on September
27, 2013, which included an increase in annual salaries of approximately 25.4% over six years. The City
subsequently reached voluntary agreements with police superiors and superior detectives. The City and the
fire union also agreed to a contract which increased salaries by 18.8% over six years through 2017. The
City is currently at mediation at the Joint Labor Management Committee with the Boston Police Detectives
Benevolent Society.

FINANCIAL OPERATIONS
Budget Process
Program-Based Budgeting
The City of Boston maintains a program-based budgeting system to track expenditures and service
levels by major functions or “programs.” This budgeting system complies with the standards of the
Government Finance Officers Association, which has consistently recognized the City’s efforts with its
Distinguished Budget Presentation Award.
The City’s fiscal year begins July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following calendar year. Pursuant to
state law, the Mayor must submit an operating budget to the City Council by the second Wednesday in
April for its review and approval. Proposed appropriations for all departments and operations of the City
(except for the public schools and public health services) are prepared under the direction of the Mayor in
the Office of Budget Management (“OBM”). The Superintendent of Schools must submit a budget to the
School Committee by the first Wednesday in February. The School Committee must approve a budget by
the fourth Wednesday in March and forward this budget to the Mayor who may approve or reduce the total
recommended budget. The Mayor then submits the school budget to the City Council for appropriation by
the second Wednesday in May. In practice, the School Department appropriation request has been
presented to the City Council in coordination with the Mayor’s operating budget request in April. The
Boston Public Health Commission (“BPHC”) must submit a revenue and expenditure budget for public
health services to the Mayor by the second Wednesday in March. If the proposed budget provides for
expenditures in excess of the BPHC’s projected revenues from non-City sources, the Mayor may either
approve or reject the budget. If the Mayor accepts the budget, the amount required to fund the revenue
deficiency (the “net cost of public health services”) is included in the annual budget for the City submitted
to the City Council in April of each year. The BPHC must adopt its public health services budget by the
second Wednesday in June.
The City Council may reduce or reject any item in the Mayor’s budget but may not, except upon the
recommendation of the Mayor, increase or add an item. The City, Boston Public Health Commission and
School Department operating budgets for fiscal 2015 were approved by the City Council on June 25, 2014.
See “Financial Operations—Fiscal 2015 Budget.” After approval of the budget and until the property tax
rate is officially determined in mid-December, the Mayor may submit to the City Council such
supplementary appropriation requests as are deemed necessary, including supplemental amounts for the
School Department and the Boston Public Health Commission. The Mayor may also submit to the City
Council supplementary appropriation requests subsequent to the setting of the property tax rate provided
that an available source of revenue is identified. Under certain circumstances, the Mayor may, by executive
order, require expenditures to be limited to an amount less than the appropriated level.
In the event that the City enters a fiscal year without an approved operating budget, the City
continues departmental operations on a “one-twelfth” budget, as provided in the City Charter. Under the
one-twelfth budget process, (a) payrolls for regular employees cannot exceed the average monthly
expenditure of the last three months of the preceding fiscal year, (b) total liabilities incurred in any month
cannot exceed amounts spent for similar purposes during any one month of the preceding fiscal year, and
(c) monthly expenditures for new departments cannot exceed one-twelfth of their current fiscal year’s
estimated costs.
By law, the City must establish its property tax rate each year so that the resulting property tax levy
complies with the requirements of Proposition 2½. (For a discussion of Proposition 2½, see “City
Revenues—Property Taxes—Proposition 2½.”) The amount raised in the tax levy equals the sum of (a) the
aggregate of all amounts appropriated, granted or lawfully expended since the last annual tax levy and not
provided for, plus (b) all debt and interest charges on general obligation debt of the City maturing during
the fiscal year and not otherwise provided for, plus (c) all amounts necessary to satisfy final judgments,
plus (d) provision for certain prior years’ deficits, less (e) the aggregate of all non-property tax revenues
projected to be received in the City’s General Fund in amounts certified or approved by the Commonwealth
for tax rate purposes. In general, the City is required to raise in the tax levy a deficit incurred on a statutory
accounting basis in the prior year’s operating budget, or a deficit incurred in the property tax abatement
reserves.
Capital Budgeting
The Office of Budget Management manages the City’s capital plan, including evaluating the
condition of the City’s capital assets, forecasting the timing and financial requirements of new construction

A-10

and rehabilitation, and assessing the allocation of current and future resources to meet the City’s
infrastructure needs. Through an annually updated five-year capital plan, the City refines its capital needs
and resources each fiscal year. In April 2014, the Mayor released the fiscal 2015-2019 capital plan and
initiated loan orders for City Council consideration. There is no statutory time frame for requesting or
approving such orders. All fiscal 2015 capital authorizations were approved by the City Council.
OBM also provides ongoing project oversight during the implementation phase of capital projects.
The City reviews and approves all capital contracts and monitors project costs and schedules to ensure the
adequacy of available funding sources in accordance with the capital plan.
Summary and Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary Basis)—Fiscal 2011 to 2014 Actual
Results and Fiscal 2015 Budget
The following table shows the City’s General Fund budget for fiscal 2015, together with budgetary
actual results for fiscal 2011 through 2014. In accordance with state law and regulations, the City’s General
Fund budget as shown below is prepared on a “budgetary basis” instead of accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Among the key differences between these two sets of
accounting principles are that “budgetary” records property tax as it is levied while GAAP records it as it
becomes susceptible to accrual, “budgetary” records certain activities and transactions in the General Fund
that GAAP records in separate funds, “budgetary” records as an expenditure any amount raised to cover a
prior year deficit, and as a revenue any available funds drawn from accumulated prior year surpluses, while
GAAP ignores these impacts from prior years. The difference in accounting principles inevitably leads to
varying results in excess or deficiency of revenues over expenditures.

(1) Represents the budget at the time of the approval of the City’s tax rate by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue on
December 15, 2014 plus any supplemental appropriations or transfers since that date.
(2) If the City’s reserves for abatements prove at the end of the fiscal year to be insufficient to cover the City’s abatement liability,
the City is required to raise in the following year’s tax rate an amount sufficient to generate additional reserves to cover the
shortfall. In fiscal 2015, the City has reserved 2.0% of the net levy for abatements.
(3) In fiscal 2011, the City applied a one-time $82 million payment from a reserve account and from an expiring revenue source to
its pension liability.
(4) Available Funds is comprised of appropriations from the Parking Meter Fund and the Cemetery Trust Fund. Appropriations from
these funds are restricted to specific uses.
(5) Non-recurring revenue represents the use of available Budgetary Fund Balance in 2011 and 2015 ($27 million, and $40 million,
respectively).
(6) The City’s appropriation to the OPEB Trust Fund is currently not a mandatory obligation and therefore, should not be considered
a “recurring expenditure.”

Fiscal 2011-2013 Actual Results
During the fiscal 2011 to 2013 period, the City maintained its pattern of the past two decades and
produced budget surpluses in each year despite a structural budget deficit that began in fiscal 2009 and
A-12

–

continued into fiscal 2010 before ending in fiscal 2011. Rapid declines from peaks in local revenue (fiscal
2008) and state aid (fiscal 2009), led to the overall decline in revenue that when combined with increased
departmental and mandatory fixed costs, led to a structural deficit that peaked at approximately $22
million, or 1.0% of total general fund operating expenditures in fiscal 2010. The City responded to this
deficit with a mix of tools that included expanding the revenue base, slowing the growth of departmental
expenditures, and the use of reserves.
The local revenue base expanded with the adoption of a new local option tax on restaurant meals and
an increase in the existing local option room occupancy tax. Both were implemented in October 2009 with
fiscal 2011 representing the first full year of such additional revenue collections. In total, the added levies
generate nearly $40 million in new annual revenue to the City. The City’s property tax base expanded when
several large properties moved from exempt to taxable status adding nearly $15 million in additional
property tax revenue in excess of the allowable levy growth.
In fiscal 2011, the City made a one-time payment into the pension fund in addition to its scheduled
payment. The City would have been required to adopt a new pension funding schedule for fiscal 2012 that
would take into account the substantial investment losses experienced in 2008 during the stock market fall.
In order to avoid the large increases in pension appropriations that would be required starting in fiscal
2012, the City elected to make a one-time payment from reserves of approximately $82 million into the
system in fiscal 2011 that substantially reduced the future payments required by a new schedule. The
revenue supporting this payment was derived largely from a pension reserve and also from the
accumulation over many years of the City’s share of deeds excise funds, a revenue source that is no longer
available to the City.
Beginning in fiscal 2010, the City and the Commonwealth agreed to a change to the historical
funding mechanism for Boston teachers’ pensions. This change relieved the City from any responsibility
for the funding of teachers’ pensions through the elimination of those pension costs from the City’s funding
schedule and the assumption of this obligation by the Commonwealth.
On April 15, 2013, two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. This event and
the emergency response that followed had a significant impact on City operations during the period of
April 15th through April 26th. The direct cost to the City was approximately $5.5 million, most of which
was police overtime. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) reimbursed the City for $3.0
million of that cost reducing the amount of overtime charged to the General Fund in fiscal 2013. An
additional $0.92 million in reimbursement was received from the Department of Justice.
For more information on Pensions, see “Employee Benefits—Retirement Systems.”
Fiscal 2014 Actual Results
The following is a summary of the City’s fiscal 2014 actual results on a budgetary accounting basis.
Expenditures
In fiscal 2014, the City’s expenditures totaled $2.64 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed expenses, which increased $148.8 million or 6.0% from fiscal 2013
expenditures. Fiscal 2014 actual expenditures compare with actual fiscal 2013 expenditures as follows:
City Departments increased $61.7 million or 5.9%; the Public Health Commission decreased $0.2 million
or -0.4%; the School Department increased $56.7 million or 6.4%; the Collective Bargaining Reserve
decreased $15.4 million or -73.1% and the appropriation to the Other Post Employment Benefit (“OPEB”)
Trust Fund remained level at $40.0 million. Actual fixed expenses for fiscal 2014 compare with actual
fiscal 2013 fixed expenses as follows: Pensions increased $15.9 million or 11.6%; Debt Service increased
$8.6 million or 6.7%; State Assessments increased $21.7 million or 12.6%; and Suffolk County Sheriff was
essentially level with the prior year.
Within the category of City Departments, items to note are the Police and Fire appropriation deficits
totaling $20.9 million which were offset by a revenue surplus. These deficits are mainly the result of higher
than budgeted overtime expenses. Fiscal 2014 actual expenditures also reflect a deficit in the Execution of
Courts account, resulting from a reserve set aside to pay for possible adverse legal rulings as well as a
deficit in Snow Removal with snow costs higher than estimated in the budget. The decrease in the
Collective Bargaining Reserve reflects union contracts that were settled in fiscal 2014 particularly public
safety unions. For more information on the impact of collective bargaining on employee benefits, see
“Employee Benefits—Retirement Systems.”

A-13

Revenues
Actual revenues for fiscal 2014 totaled $2.65 billion, an increase from fiscal 2013 actual revenues of
$150.1 million or 6.0%. Selected fiscal 2014 actual revenues compare with fiscal 2013 actual revenues as
follows: The Gross Property Tax Levy (including new growth) increased $95.4 million or 5.7%; Excises
increased $12.8 million or 7.4%; Fines increased by $0.1 million or 0.2%; Interest on Investments
decreased $0.1 million or -68.3%; voluntary Payment In Lieu of Taxes (“PILOT”) revenues increased $0.8
million or 2.0%; Licenses and Permits increased by $13.6 million or 29.8%; and State Aid increased $19.1
million or 4.7%. Non-recurring revenue was not utilized in either year.
The increase in Excises was due to growth in all major categories including Motor Vehicle, Room
Occupancy, Jet Fuel and Meals excises. The addition of revenue from the Vehicle Rental Surcharge,
formerly dedicated to Convention Center special obligation debt refunded as general obligation debt in
fiscal 2011, added nearly $1.2 million to Excises in fiscal 2014. The decrease in Interest on Investments
revenue was due to the continued action of the Federal Reserve to maintain its target federal funds rate
between 0.0% and 0.25% thus limiting returns on the City’s historically conservative investment policies.
The modest increase in Fines is due to increased compliance after several years of targeted fine rate
increases. The increase in Licenses & Permits was due to increased building permit revenue and a timing
issue related to Cable Television fees. The increase in State Aid was due to increases in reimbursements for
charter school tuition along with an increase in education aid. For more detailed information regarding
State Aid, see “City Revenues—State Aid.”
In both fiscal 2013 and 2014, the City was able to fund the appropriation to the Other PostEmployment Benefits (“OPEB”) Trust Fund using recurring revenue sources instead of Budgetary Fund
Balance. Budgetary Fund Balance is available for appropriation only after certification of its value by the
Massachusetts Department of Revenue.
Fiscal 2015 Budget
The following is a summary of expectations regarding the City’s fiscal 2015 budget on a budgetary
accounting basis. The figures cited below are comparisons to fiscal 2014 actual figures.
Expenditures
In fiscal 2015, the City’s budgeted expenditures total $2.7 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed expenses, representing an increase of $90.8 million or 3.4% from fiscal
2014 actual expenditures. Budgeted fiscal 2015 departmental expenditures compare with fiscal 2014
expenditures as follows. City Departments decrease $11.3 million or -1.0%. Reserves were established in
fiscal 2014 for projected legal liabilities, as well as an increased contribution to the City’s risk reserve,
neither of which are included in the fiscal 2015 budget.
The Public Health Commission expenditures increase $3.0 million or 4.6% with the settlement of the
union contract for employees in Emergency Medical Services Bureau.
The School Department expenditures increase $37.0 million or 3.9% which reflects collective
bargaining and annual step increases for teachers. The School Department continues to experience
expenditure pressure particularly in the area of student transportation and has enacted several cost reduction
measures in an effort to stay within its fiscal 2015 appropriation.
The City of Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have seen an unprecedented amount of
snow fall in fiscal 2015 that started with the blizzard Juno in late January 2015. It is expected that the City
will exceed the $18.5 million budget established for snow removal, however, this budget is allowed to run
into deficit as a matter of public safety and it is expected that the City will identify a revenue source to
cover the expenses. In addition, the City has filed an initial assessment report with the Massachusetts
Emergency Management Agency seeking disaster recovery funds for the time periods identified by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency for the Juno storm. Recently, the City of Boston has received
guidance from the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency to compile the cumulative cost impact
of emergency snow plowing, snow removal, and emergency protective measures for public safety for a
total of four storms including Juno for a time period that extends to February 22, 2015 with the hope that
additional costs will be reimbursed. Estimates for total costs related to snow removal for this winter are
currently in the range of $40 million to $50 million.
The Collective Bargaining Reserve increases $5.2 million or 91.3% which reflects wage patterns
accepted by civilian and public safety unions.
The Emergency Medical Services collective bargaining agreement that settled in fiscal 2015 was
fully funded from the Collective Bargaining Reserve.
A-14

The appropriation to the OPEB Trust Fund is level-funded at $40 million. Budgeted fixed expenses
for fiscal 2015 compare with fiscal 2014 actual expenditures as follows: Pensions increase $16.7 million or
10.9%, Debt Service increases $17.3 million or 12.4%; and State Assessments increase $22.6 million or
11.7%.
The increase in budgeted pension costs is due to the regular increase provided by the pension funding
schedule as approved by the state actuary. Pension expenses are mandated by the City’s pension funding
schedule and are a legal obligation of the City. For more on Pensions, see “Employee Benefits—Retirement
Systems,” below. State assessments are also mandatory; the amounts are determined by the
Commonwealth. All but a small portion of the increase in State Assessments is the result of increases in the
assessment to the City for Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (“MBTA”) service and for charter
school tuition.
Revenues
Budgeted revenues for fiscal 2015 are expected to total $2.74 billion, an increase of $81.2 million or
3.1% from fiscal 2014 actual revenues. Selected fiscal 2015 budgeted revenues compare with fiscal 2014
actual revenues as follows: The budgeted Gross Property Tax Levy (including new growth) increases $88.0
million or 4.9%; Excises decrease $20.5 million or -11.0%; Chapter 121A revenues decrease $14.5 million
or -23.3%; Misc. Department Revenues decrease by $10.3 million or -15.9%; Licenses and Permits
decrease $13.7 million or -23.1%; State Aid decreased by $3.9 million or -0.9% and Non-Recurring
Revenue increases by $40 million or 100.0% to fund the OPEB Trust Fund. The City used recurring
revenue to fund the OPEB Trust Fund in fiscal 2013 and 2014.
The increase in budgeted Property Tax includes several expiring Chapter 121A properties that will
now pay property tax under Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 59, rather than a payment in lieu of tax
under Chapter 121A. The Property Tax, the City’s largest source of revenue, has become increasingly
important to the City’s revenue growth given the recent fluctuations in state aid from the Commonwealth—
the City’s second largest single source of revenue, see “City Revenues—State Aid.” The City has always
increased the Property Tax levy annually by the maximum amount allowed under statutory limits.
The decrease in budgeted Excises is largely due to conservative revenue estimates across all excise
categories. The decrease in Misc. Department Revenue is due to the loss of some one-time revenues
received in fiscal 2014. The decrease in Licenses & Permits is due to fluctuating actual results over the past
two fiscal years and a conservative estimate of building permit revenue. The decrease in State Aid is due to
a decrease in the reimbursement for charter school tuition, partially offset by an increase to Unrestricted
General Government Aid. For more detailed information regarding State Aid, see “City Revenues—State
Aid.”
It is expected that in fiscal 2015 the City of Boston will meet its revenue budget in the aggregate and
will have sufficient revenue to support emergency spending for snow removal and other public safety costs.
Federal Sequestration
Certain federal funding received by the City has been and is expected to be adversely affected by
implementation of certain provisions of the federal Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “Budget Control
Act”), which was signed into law by the President on August 2, 2011. The Joint Select Committee on
Deficit Reduction failed to reach an agreement on the deficit reduction actions as required by the Budget
Control Act and, as a result, sequestration was triggered. No legislative action was taken by Congress prior
to March 1, 2013 and, accordingly, implementation of sequestration began on March 1, 2013.
The City has issued general obligation bonds in the form of Build America Bonds (“BABs”),
Qualified School Construction Bonds (“QSCBs”), and Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds
(“RZEDBs”) (collectively, the “Tax Benefited Bonds”), under the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 (“ARRA”). Pursuant to ARRA, the City is entitled to receive cash subsidy payments from the
federal government, provided the City makes certain required filings in accordance with applicable federal
rules. Such interest subsidy payments are treated under federal law as overpayments of tax and,
accordingly, are subject to offset against certain amounts that may be owed by the City to the federal
government or its agencies. The City has issued approximately $106.6 million aggregate principal amount
of Tax Benefited Bonds.
The Internal Revenue Service, under the Budget Control Act of 2011, released notifications to the
City on four occasions since March 2013, stating that such interest subsidy payments are affected by
sequestration reduction rates for the fiscal years 2013 through 2016; the projected loss in cash subsidy
payments through fiscal 2016 is approximately $904.7 thousand. The City is obligated to make payments of

A-15

principal and interest on the Tax Benefited Bonds whether or not it receives interest subsidy payments and
is able to adjust for federal reductions under sequestration with available funding in debt service accounts.
The City does not currently believe that any reduction of cash subsidy payments will have an adverse effect
on its financial condition or its ability to pay debt service on its Tax Benefited Bonds. All subsidy payments
will be subject to sequestration reductions through federal fiscal year 2024, the rates to be set from time to
time.
Bid for 2024 Olympics
On January 8, 2015, the United States Olympic Committee (“USOC”) selected the City of Boston as
the United States applicant city for the summer 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games (the “2024
Olympics”).
Following a January 2013 Resolve of the Massachusetts Legislature regarding the “Special
Commission Relative to the Feasibility of Hosting the Summer Olympics in the Commonwealth,” Boston
2024 Partnership, Inc. (“Boston 2024”), a Massachusetts charitable corporation, was established in January
2014 for the purpose of considering the costs and benefits of hosting the 2024 Olympics, supporting
analysis and public discussion of such an effort and, if circumstances so warrant, forming an organizing
committee for the 2024 Olympics. In connection with the selection of the City by the USOC, Boston 2024
and the USOC agreed to enter into a Bid City Agreement (the “Bid City Agreement”), and the City and the
USOC agreed to enter into a Joinder Agreement with respect to the Bid City Agreement (the “Joinder
Agreement”), which agreements will set forth the terms and conditions under which the parties will work
jointly toward selection of the City to host the 2024 Olympics by the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) in 2017.
The Bid City Agreement allocates roles among the City, the USOC and Boston 2024 and provides for
cooperation in all matters relating to preparation of a bid to the IOC, including without limitation a budget,
terms for marketing and sponsoring activities, and procedures for finalizing the plans and arrangements for
venues and facilities necessary to host the 2024 Olympics. Among other things, the Bid City Agreement
requires a broadly stated indemnification from the City for the benefit of the USOC for its involvement
and, in the case of volitional abandonment of the plan to bid without USOC consent, other than as a result
of a change in law prohibiting a bid by the City, requires a payment of $25 million in stipulated damages
from the City to the USOC. Boston 2024 has agreed to indemnify the City against any and all liabilities
related to activities undertaken under the Bid City Agreement and Joinder Agreement, including the
payment of stipulated damages. Boston 2024 has purchased insurance with liability limits in the aggregate
amount of $25 million that provides coverage for, among other things, Boston 2024’s indemnity
obligations to the City, including but not limited to, Boston 2024’s agreement to indemnify the City for the
$25 million in stipulated damages under the Bid City Agreement. Boston 2024 has also obtained other
insurance, including without limitation general liability and umbrella insurance, for which the City of
Boston is an additional insured, which insurance provides additional insurance coverage with respect to the
City’s liability exposure under the Bid City Agreement. The insurance coverage is subject to certain
exclusions including fraud, criminal acts, or omissions and other customary exclusions.
It is expected that there will be significant competition among several prominent international cities
for the opportunity to host the 2024 Olympics.
If the City were selected by the IOC to be the host city for the 2024 Olympics, the City will be
obligated to enter into a comprehensive Host City Contract with the IOC, the USOC and Boston 2024
serving as the Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games (“OCOG”). The form of such Host City
Contract for the 2024 Olympics has not been published by the IOC.
Based on precedent in prior similar agreements, it is expected that the City and the OCOG will be
obligated to perform in accordance with detailed policies and protocols set forth in the Host City Contract
and in numerous technical manuals promulgated by the IOC. As part of the documentation, it is expected
that the City and OCOG will provide formal guaranties for the benefit of the IOC. The City and OCOG
undertakings will cover a wide range of issues ranging from adherence to the Olympic Movement (as
defined by IOC), protection of IOC intellectual property, provision of specified accommodations for
athletes and visitors, sharing and preservation of marketing and sponsoring opportunities, compliance with
IOC principles and standards generally and funding the costs of delivery of the 2024 Olympics. One of the
obligations will be to indemnify the IOC against any costs and expenses to which it has not agreed. The
stipulated damage liability payable to the USOC for volitional abandonment of the agreement to host the
2024 Olympics after selection by the IOC and other than as a result of change in law prohibiting a bid by
the City, would be $100 million. The total financial exposure to Boston 2024, as the OCOG under the Host
City Contract, and therefore the potential for any additional exposure for the City beyond costs expected to
A-16

be funded by operating revenues, federal funding of security-related costs, insurance coverage and private
funding through public-private joint ventures and fundraising, cannot be quantified at this early stage of the
bid process. Boston 2024 has indicated to the City that it is committed to eliminating or minimizing such
risk to the maximum extent possible.
The City, the USOC and Boston 2024 are engaged in a comprehensive exploration of the details of
preparing a suitable bid to the IOC and are currently engaged in an extensive public discussion of the
proposal. A decision by the City, the USOC and Boston 2024 on whether to proceed with a bid is required
by the IOC in September 2015.
Fiscal 2016 and 2017 Forecasts
The fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 budget forecasts currently project structural deficits of $6.6 million
and $5.5 million, respectively. The deficit in fiscal 2016 is expected to be offset by the use of reserves and
the fiscal 2017 deficit will be managed down over the remainder of fiscal 2015 and during fiscal 2016
when the fiscal 2017 budget is prepared. The fiscal year 2017 forecast currently does not include a reserve
for collective bargaining for successor agreements that are scheduled to expire in fiscal 2016. The City will
continue to evaluate its long term financial condition in fiscal 2016 and develop a wage proposal for
successor collective bargaining agreements that will be managed within that fiscal context.
The City of Boston has given guidance to the Boston Public School District that it can expect to see
an increase to its fiscal 2016 general fund appropriation that is provided by the City of Boston in a range
between a 3% to 4% increase. The current forecast includes a fiscal 2016 general fund increase for Boston
Public Schools that totals $39 million. The School Department administration is expected to submit a
balanced budget proposal for fiscal 2016 to the School Committee for its review and adoption by the end of
March.
Financial Statements
The City engages independent certified public accountants to audit and report on its financial
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. An
external Audit Committee, appointed by the Mayor, monitors the progress of the annual audit, reviews the
recommendations of the accounting firm and reports the Committee’s activities and recommendations to
the Mayor and the City Council.
The City’s audited financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The accounts of the City are organized
on the basis of funds. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a set of self-balancing accounts
that comprise its assets, liabilities, net position/fund balance, revenues and expenditures/expenses. For a
discussion of the significant accounting policies employed in preparing the City’s fiscal 2014 audited
financial statements, see Note 2 of such audited financial statements, which are attached hereto as Exhibit I.
The City’s fiscal 2014 financial statements received an unmodified opinion.
GAAP accounting differs from the “statutory” accounting or “budgetary” accounting basis prescribed
by the Bureau of Accounts of the Commonwealth, for the annual budget and property tax certification
process. The major differences are explained in Note 4 of the fiscal 2014 audited financial statements,
attached hereto as Exhibit I.
Attached hereto as Exhibit II are Comparative Balance Sheets and Statements of Revenues,
Expenditures, Transfers and Equity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, and 2010,
which have been prepared by the City’s Auditing Department based on information taken from the City’s
audited financial statements for those fiscal years.

The following is a summary analysis of the City’s financial operations on a GAAP basis over the
period fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2014. The figures appearing in this section for the period are derived from
the City’s audited annual financial statements. The analyses of revenues and expenditures in the text that
follows are stated using data derived from the audited financial statements. For an explanation of the
differences between the GAAP basis and Budgetary basis of accounting, see the audited financial
statements at Exhibit I, Note 4, “Budgetary Data.”
The City’s major recurring revenue sources during this period were real and personal property taxes,
state aid, Payments In Lieu Of Taxes (“PILOTs”), local excise taxes and departmental revenues, and other
intergovernmental sources. The principal expenditures were for public safety, debt service requirements,
retirement costs, employee benefits, state and district assessments, and the School Department. Reference is
made to Exhibits I and II attached hereto for a detailed presentation of the City’s financial operations.
Fiscal 2010
In fiscal 2010, the City’s General Fund revenue increased by 0.5% from fiscal 2009. The City’s
largest sources of revenues were property taxes, excise taxes and fines totaling $1.66 billion or 74% of total
revenue. Property taxes increased $74.2 million, representing a positive change of 5.3% from fiscal 2009.
Departmental and other revenue, investment income and licenses and permits had a combined revenue
decrease of $30.1 million or -21.4% from fiscal 2009. Lower returns on City investments and a decline in
building permits continue to be the major factors for this decrease in revenue.
Fiscal 2010 General Fund expenditures increased by $171.6 million, or 7.6% from fiscal 2009. The
City’s largest expenditures were for schools ($815.7 million), public safety ($511.4 million), retirement
costs ($235.3 million), other employee benefits ($224.2 million), and state and district assessments ($146.3
million). Schools experienced a decrease in expenditures of $2.6 million (-0.3%), while Public Safety saw
an expenditure decrease of $10.5 million (-2.0%). Other employee benefits and state and district
assessments experienced increases of $32.6 million (17.0%) and $4.3 million (3.0%), respectively.
Retirement costs increased $153.0 million in 2010. This extraordinary increase is attributable to the
aforementioned change in the funding of Boston Teachers’ Pensions. As a direct result of the change in the
funding mechanism between the City and the Commonwealth, the City did not receive $118.8 million in
state reimbursement for the Teachers’ Pension contribution it made in fiscal 2009. This change caused a
notable, one-time impact to the City’s retirement costs, as well as General Fund equity. Consequently, the
City’s General Fund equity balance as of June 30, 2010 was $707.2 million, a decrease of $121.5 million
from fiscal 2009.
A-18

Fiscal 2011
During fiscal 2011, General Fund revenue increased by 2.0% from fiscal 2010. The City’s largest
sources of revenues were property taxes, excise taxes and fines totaling $1.72 billion or 75% of total
revenue. Property taxes increased $58.8 million, representing a positive change of 4.0% from fiscal 2010.
Licenses and permits increased by $8.8 million or 26.6%. Departmental and other revenue decreased by
$9.4 million or -12.5% since fiscal 2010. This was due to a decrease in Muni Medicaid reimbursements for
fiscal 2011.
Fiscal 2011 General Fund expenditures increased by $43.1 million, or 1.8% from fiscal 2010. The
City’s largest expenditures were for schools ($812.9 million), public safety ($516.7 million), other
employee benefits ($294.2 million), retirement costs ($196.0 million), and state and district assessments
($152.0 million). Schools experienced a decrease in expenditures of $2.7 million (-0.3%), while public
safety saw a $5.4 million increase (1.0%) in expenditures. Other employee benefits and state and district
assessments experienced increases of $70.0 million (31.2%) and $5.7 million (3.9%) respectively.
Retirement costs decreased by $39.3 million in 2011.
The General Fund’s equity balance as of June 30, 2011 was $652.9 million, a decrease of $54.3
million from fiscal 2010. The decrease in equity balance is partly due to the City’s decision to make a onetime payment totaling $82.0 million to the Employee Retirement Fund, which helped lower the amounts
otherwise required to fund the pension liability in fiscal 2012 and the years to follow.
Fiscal 2012
During fiscal 2012, General Fund revenue increased by 10.2% from fiscal 2011. The City’s largest
sources of revenues were property taxes, excise taxes and fines totaling $1.84 billion or 73% of total
revenue. Property taxes increased $65.6 million, representing a positive change of 4.3% from fiscal 2011.
Licenses and permits increased by $7.1 million or 17.0%. Departmental and other revenue increased by
$12.9 million or 19.8% since fiscal 2011.
Fiscal 2012 General Fund expenditures increased by $9.0 million, or 0.37% from fiscal 2011. The
City’s largest expenditures were for schools ($830.8 million), public safety ($524.5 million), other
employee benefits ($251.2 million), retirement costs ($220.3 million), and state and district assessments
($160.5 million). Schools experienced an increase in expenditures of $17.9 million (2.2%), while public
safety saw a $7.8 million increase (1.5%) in expenditures. Other employee benefits experienced a decrease
of $43.0 million (-14.6%), while state and district assessments increased $8.5 million (5.6%). Retirement
costs increased by $24.4 million in 2012.
The General Fund’s equity balance as of June 30, 2012 was $689.7 million, an increase of $36.8
million from fiscal 2011.
Fiscal 2013
During fiscal 2013, General Fund revenue increased by 5.9% from fiscal 2012. The City’s largest
sources of revenues were property taxes, excise taxes and payment in lieu of taxes totaling $1.98 billion or
73.8% of total revenue. Property taxes increased $85.6 million, representing a positive change of 5.4%
from fiscal 2012. Licenses and permits decreased by $1.5 million or -3.1%. Departmental and other
revenue increased by $9.1 million or 11.7% since fiscal 2012.
Fiscal 2013 General Fund expenditures increased by $115.5 million, or 4.6% from fiscal 2012. The
City’s largest expenditures were for schools ($879.9 million), public safety ($553.9 million), other
employee benefits ($232.9 million), retirement costs ($235.1 million), and state and district assessments
($176.3 million). Schools experienced an increase in expenditures of $49.1 million (5.9%), while public
safety saw a $29.4 million increase (5.6%) in expenditures. Other employee benefits experienced a
decrease of $18.4 million (-7.3%), while state and district assessments increased $15.8 million (9.8%).
Retirement costs increased by $14.7 million in 2013.
The General Fund’s equity balance as of June 30, 2013 was $751.4 million, an increase of $61.7
million from fiscal 2012.
Fiscal 2014
During fiscal 2014, General Fund revenue increased by $110.4 million or 4.1% from fiscal 2013. The
City’s largest sources of revenues were property taxes, excise taxes and payment in lieu of taxes totaling
$2.06 billion or 74.25% of total revenue. Property taxes increased $90.2 million, representing a positive
change of 5.4% from fiscal 2013. Licenses and permits increased by $15.0 million or 31.8%. Departmental
and other revenue decreased by $3.2 million or -3.7% since fiscal 2013.
A-19

Fiscal 2014 General Fund expenditures increased by $161.3 million, or 6.2% from fiscal 2013. The
City’s largest expenditures were for schools ($940.3 million), public safety ($558.8 million), other
employee benefits ($234.4 million), retirement costs ($255.6 million), and state and district assessments
($197.9 million). Schools experienced an increase in expenditures of $60.4 million (6.9%), while public
safety saw a $5.0 million increase (0.9%) in expenditures. Other employee benefits experienced an increase
of $1.6 million (0.7%), while state and district assessments increased $21.6 million (12.3%). Retirement
costs increased by $20.6 million in 2014.
The General Fund’s equity balance as of June 30, 2014 was $784.3 million, an increase of $32.9
million from fiscal 2013.

City of Boston Treasury Department.

Financial Administration
Pursuant to state law mandates and policy initiatives, the City has established a system of internal
management controls. These controls are designed to maximize revenue collections, monitor operating and
capital spending, evaluate infrastructure needs, and enhance the City’s internal control in business
procedures. Major components of the City’s system of financial management controls include:
Revenue Collections
The City has implemented a comprehensive accounts receivable management program that
coordinates the collection of departmental revenues. The City has afforded taxpayers the ability to remit
payment for licenses, permits, fees, and fines with credit and debit cards and has given taxpayers an
alternative choice in paying real estate taxes by use of online direct debit or credit card payments. The City
secures its statutory lien for delinquent real estate taxes with instruments recorded at the Suffolk County
Registry of Deeds (“tax takings”). For more information concerning tax takings and collection of
delinquent real estate taxes, see “City Revenues—Property Taxes—Delinquent Taxes and Tax Title.”
Debt Management
The City uses a comprehensive, interactive debt capacity model that assists debt management
administrators in evaluating the potential impact of debt issues on cash flow, credit and statutory debt
capacity.
The Treasury Department manages all City borrowings. The Treasury Department focuses on the
timing of borrowings to take advantage of favorable market conditions and manages the City’s cash flows
to help obviate the need for short-term borrowings for operating purposes. The Treasury Department has
established a series of debt management guidelines and has instituted a debt policy that direct the City’s
approach toward its debt management activities, including rapid debt repayment, the use of a debt capacity
model for establishing debt affordability, limitations on the level of variable rate debt the City will employ,
if any, maintenance of the relationship between debt and repayment sources, target savings for refundings,
A-20

and responding to and communicating with the financial community and the rating agencies. The City has
no outstanding variable rate debt.
Financial Management
Financial management is supported through the use of the Boston Administrative Information
Systems (“BAIS”). BAIS is an integrated financial and human resources management system that is
designed to track and control daily activities and report the financial position of the City. BAIS performs
the specialized functions of encumbrance control, budget control, position management, payroll allotment
reporting, fund accounting, and capital project and grant management. Real time edits prohibit excessive
commitments and overspending, while on-line access to information, including monthly revenue and
expenditure reports, allows department managers to evaluate directly the financial status of individual
programs and the entire department. The utilization of these systems supports the rigorous monitoring and
reporting requirements enforced by the City.
The City of Boston has consistently received unmodified opinions on the audit of its Basic Financial
Statements and has been presented with a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting
from the Government Finance Officers Association for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
(“CAFR”) for 19 consecutive years. In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, a governmental
unit must publish an easily readable and efficiently organized CAFR. The CAFR must satisfy both GAAP
and applicable state and local legal requirements.
Investment Policy
The City has enacted and annually reviews and updates its investment policy statement that dictates
the types of investments made by the City Treasury. The policy also focuses on the appropriate balance of
liquidity and the rate of return on investments. Bond proceeds, in conformance with the City’s policy, are
invested in highly liquid, fully collateralized investments.
Performance Management and Program Evaluation
Boston About Results (“BAR”) is the City’s performance management and evaluation program. BAR
aims to create a sustainable and reliable performance management system which captures the core
functions of City departments and citywide strategic goals, assists in the decision-making process,
identifies areas of improvement, and effectively communicates performance results to a broad range of
stakeholders.
Using performance management as its foundation, BAR encourages organizational changes and
operational improvements that increase the effectiveness and productivity of City departments. The
program does this by providing reliable, objective, and independent information and reports to City
managers about department performance and operations.
Risk Management
The City’s Risk Management strategy focuses on reducing the costs of third party liabilities, worker
injuries, employee health care costs, and property damages, through internal claims management,
department accountability, and a structured self-insurance program.
Legal liabilities are capped per M.G.L. Chapter 258, and Corporation Counsel defends the City in any
lawsuits that arise from the normal course of operations. Civilian workplace injuries are managed through
the City’s Workers’ Compensation Program. Police and Fire Departments manage their workers’
compensation programs. These costs are budgeted and funded through the General Fund. Departments are
charged for their share of costs in order to promote awareness and prevention efforts.
Health benefits for over 29,000 City employees and retirees are managed by the Health Benefits
Program. Over 90% of the City’s share of health benefit costs are self-insured through internal service
funds established in compliance with M.G.L Chapter 32B Section 3A. Reserves, exceeding 10% of annual
claims, are maintained in the Funds to stabilize rate increases and protect against large claims or cost
increases.
Building damages are managed by individual departments, assisted by the Property & Construction
Management Department. Large damages are insured through a catastrophic property insurance policy,
which provides $100.0 million for all risk protection after a $10.0 million deductible, with a lower $1,000
deductible for fine arts. An additional boiler and machinery insurance policy provides up to $25.0 million
per incident.

A-21

For unexpected large costs in all categories just described, the City maintains a catastrophic risk
reserve, which had an available balance of $26.0 million at the end of fiscal 2014.
Energy Management
The members of the Mayor’s Energy Management Board—the Chief of Environment, Energy and
Open Space, Chief Financial Officer, Chief of Operations, and Chief of Information and Technology—
together are charged with making decisions regarding the City’s procurement, use, and conservation of
energy. In addition, they monitor the City’s progress in meeting the greenhouse gas reduction goals
required by the City’s Climate Action Plan. The Energy Management Unit housed within the Environment,
Energy and Open Space Cabinet works with City departments and the Office of Budget Management to
develop design standards and implement measures that enhance the energy efficiency of the City’s new
construction and capital improvement projects.
During fiscal 2014 the City retrofitted 8,770 streetlights with efficient light emitting diode (“LED”)
fixtures, and completed more than thirty efficiency projects at various facilities around the City. In the
aggregate these projects reduced the electricity demand associated with the City’s municipal operations by
9.4 million kilowatt hours: enough electricity to power approximately 1,250 single-family homes for an
entire year. To better track and control energy use, the City has acquired a cloud-based Enterprise Energy
Management System (“EEMS”). The EEMS enables the City to monitor and report on the energy
consumed by its 320 buildings and other fixed assets, and its vehicle fleet, and is used by the City to meet
its public reporting obligation under the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance.
The City’s electricity requirements have been met by third-party commodity supply contractors since
March 2005. To date, the amounts the City has paid to its third-party electricity suppliers have been less
than the amounts it would have paid if it had continued to accept default electric service from its local
distribution company, Eversource, formerly known as NSTAR - Boston Edison Company.

A-22

CITY REVENUES
The principal sources of City revenue available to meet operating expenditures are property taxes,
state aid, excise revenues, departmental revenues, and federal and state grants, all of which are described
below. Except as specifically noted, all amounts are stated on a budgetary accounting basis.
Property Taxes
Real and personal property taxes are the largest single source of the City’s revenue. The City’s gross
property tax levy for fiscal 2015 equals $1.87 billion, or 68.2% of City General Fund revenues of $2.73
billion budgeted for such period. Certain properties are subject to arrangements that suspend the imposition
of real property taxes at normal rates in order to encourage development. See “City Revenues—Property
Taxes—Revenues from Chapter 121A Properties” below.
As discussed below, Proposition 2½ limits the level of property taxation in the City. In fiscal 2015,
the City will again levy taxes below the 2.5% ceiling on the overall effective tax rate. The City is not
expected to reach the levy ceiling in the foreseeable future due to previous growth in the real estate market.
Proposition 2½
Proposition 2½ is a statewide tax limitation subject to amendment or repeal by the legislature that
imposes two separate limits on the annual tax levy of a city or town. The primary limitation of Proposition
2½ is that the property tax levy in any city or town in the Commonwealth cannot exceed 2.5% of the full
and fair cash valuation of the taxable real estate and personal property in that city or town (the “2½
ceiling”). The only exception is the temporary exclusion of debt service or capital costs from the levy
ceiling restrictions, as described below.
Within the limits of the 2½ ceiling, the Growth Levy Limit is a secondary limitation imposed by
Proposition 2½. The Growth Levy Limit prohibits the levy in a fiscal year from exceeding an amount equal
to 102.5% of the maximum allowable limit for the preceding year, subject to exceptions for the following:
property newly added to the tax rolls and valuation increases other than as a result of a general revaluation
(“new growth”); temporary exclusions from the tax levy limitation to pay for capital costs or debt service
on indebtedness; and “overrides,” which are permanent increases in the tax levy for general expenditures of
the city or town. Exclusions and overrides must be approved by a referendum of the voters of the city or
town. The levy is permanently increased by the addition of new growth and overrides, except that any
override to fund a stabilization fund will not be taken into account in calculating the maximum levy limit in
subsequent fiscal years unless the City Council votes to appropriate such increased amount in such
subsequent year to the stabilization fund. The exclusion of debt service by referendum temporarily
increases the levy amount and the duration of the specific debt excluded. The Growth Levy Limit may be
exceeded by an override in any year by a majority vote of the voters. An increase in the Growth Levy Limit
under this procedure, however, does not permit a tax levy in excess of the 2½ ceiling since the two
limitations apply independently. The applicable tax limits may also be reduced in any year by a majority
vote of the voters. The City’s gross levy in fiscal 2015 equals $1.87 billion. In fiscal 2015, the allowable
2.5% increase is $44.5 million, and “new growth” is $44.3 million.
In order to mitigate its adverse impact on local government revenues, Proposition 2½ limits the
annual rate of increase of aggregate, statewide assessments made upon cities and towns by the
Commonwealth and certain of its governmental entities, such as assessments made upon the City and
certain other cities and towns for the MBTA, to 2.5% of the prior year’s assessment. Proposition 2½ also
limits the motor vehicle excise tax rate to 2.5%.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Proposition 2½ described above, the City’s Bond Procedure Act of
1983 mandates assessment of taxes in excess of the Proposition 2½ levy limits to the extent that the debt
service on City obligations is not otherwise provided for in the tax levy or from other sources, with no
allowance made for any other expenditures of the City. See “City Indebtedness—Classification of City
Debt.”

December of each fiscal year and does not include omitted assessments.
The Growth Levy Limit is the maximum allowable levy as determined by Proposition 2½.
For each fiscal year, the amount of the actual Tax Levy is the largest amount possible. The Growth Levy Limit would be
exceeded if the tax rate were raised an additional cent ($0.01).

Revaluation
State law mandates a revaluation of all taxable property every three years. These revaluations are
reviewed and certified by the Commonwealth. In the years between revaluations, the Commonwealth
requires municipalities to establish new values on the basis of market changes, using the most recent
revaluation as a basis. The City has adjusted certified property values in accordance with this procedure in
years when market conditions indicated such adjustment was necessary.
In November 2012, the City concluded work on its 11thtriennial revaluation for fiscal 2013, with an
assessment date of January 1, 2012. For fiscal 2015, assessments were based on market activity leading up
to the assessment date of January 1, 2014. Fiscal 2015 assessments reflected an appreciating real estate
market with some neighborhoods exhibiting greater levels of appreciation than others over the prior year.

The City utilizes five classes of property for taxation purposes: (i) residential, (ii) open space land,
(iii) commercial, (iv) industrial and (v) personal property. Within limits under state law, the City may
determine the share of the annual levy to be borne by each of the categories. Under these statutory limits,
the residential tax rate cannot be given a discount greater than 50%, while the tax rate on the remaining
business classes of property cannot exceed 175% of the overall effective tax rate.
The City may also exempt a portion of the assessed valuation of residential real property when used
as the taxpayer’s principal residence. The amount of the residential exemption can equal up to 30% of the
average assessed value of all residential property in the City. In fiscal 2015, qualifying residents who
receive the residential exemption have their taxable assessed values reduced by $155.2 thousand. The
residential exemption has no impact on the overall tax rate.

The Largest Taxpayers table includes entities with a fiscal 2015 tax liability greater than $10 million. The methodology used in
creating the table involves the search of the title holder(s) of all major parcels of property in the City. This methodology does not
necessarily locate all parcels owned by affiliates nor does it differentiate between percentage ownership in a particular parcel.

The City’s property tax bills are mailed quarterly in July, October, December, and April. The bills
mailed in July and October represent preliminary tax bills each equal to one quarter of the previous fiscal
year’s liability. The fair cash value of the property or assessment for the purpose of determining the new
fiscal year tax liability is reflected in the third and fourth quarter bills, which are mailed in December and
April. See “City Revenues—Property Taxes—Taxation by Use; Tax Rates.”
Delinquent Taxes and Tax Titles
Real and personal property taxes (not including motor vehicle, the room occupancy and the aircraft
fuel excises) are based on values established by the Assessing Department as of each January 1, and are due
in quarterly payments every August, November, February and May. Delinquent real estate and personal
property taxes are subject to a 14% per annum interest charge. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year in
which real estate taxes become delinquent, the City secures its lien for such taxes by taking legal title to all
delinquent properties, subject to the owners’ right of redemption. After this process, known as a “tax
taking,” is complete, interest accrues on outstanding amounts of delinquent real estate taxes at the rate of
16% per annum. If the taxes remain unpaid for a period of six months from the tax taking, the City may
petition the Land Court to foreclose the equity owner’s right of redemption. Upon foreclosure, the City may
then sell the property in order to liquidate the tax liability. The City estimates that the value of the
properties to which such tax titles are attached is substantially less than the amount of delinquent taxes,
charges, and interest owed.
Tax title receipts were $16.2 million, $17.1 million and $15.9 million, in fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014,
respectively.
Revenues from Chapter 121A Corporations
A local government in cooperation with its redevelopment authorities may suspend the imposition of
real property taxes at normal levels on properties determined to be “blighted” in order to encourage
redevelopment of such properties by special corporations organized under Chapter 121A (“Chapter 121A
Corporations”). The City receives two principal sources of revenue from Chapter 121A Corporations. The
first consists of excise PILOTs for each Chapter 121A Corporation that are collected by the
Commonwealth and distributed to the City. The second form of revenue is contract payments resulting
from agreements that may be entered into between the Chapter 121A Corporation and the City relating to
City services available to the development.
Revenues received by the City from Chapter 121A Corporations for the last five fiscal years are
shown in the following table.

State Aid
State aid from the Commonwealth comprises the second largest single revenue source to the City’s
General Fund after the Property Tax. Over the course of the previous decade, support to municipalities
from the Commonwealth has been consistently reduced.
The City experienced reductions in actual state aid revenue totaling $102.9 million or -20.8%
between fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, the trend of declining state aid revenue ended with an
increase of $12.8 million or 3.3%. Fiscal 2014 state aid also grew, increasing by $19.1 million or 4.7%.
Adjusting for the recent increases, the total loss in state aid revenue between fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2014
amounts to $70.9 million or -14.4%.
The State Treasurer is empowered to deduct “assessments” from state aid amounts appropriated to the
City. The largest of these assessments is now that for Charter School Tuition followed by that for MBTA.
Charter Schools are public schools, open to all students that apply, that are funded by “tuition,” 100% of
which is paid by the students’ home or “sending” school district. A recent increase in the legislatively
imposed cap on charter school enrollments has caused this cost to grow rapidly. Assessments also include
smaller charges for various state-provided services, which may include debt service paid by the
Commonwealth on “qualified bonds” and any sums allocable to the Boston Water and Sewer Commission
or the City that are due and unpaid on debt issued to the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust (“MCWT”),
formerly the Massachusetts Water Pollution Abatement Trust. The City has no “qualified bonds”
outstanding and has never been assessed for unpaid amounts due the MCWT.
“Net state aid” or, total state aid net of “assessments”, has declined more than state aid revenue due to
the rapidly increasing assessment for charter school tuition mentioned above. Between fiscal 2008 and
fiscal 2012, net state aid declined by $131.2 million or -35.9%. Fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014 have furthered
that decline by an additional $5.5 million for a total loss of state resources since fiscal 2008 of $136.7
million or -37.5%. State Assessments are expected to increase to $216.7 million in fiscal 2015, compared to
$194.1 million in fiscal 2014, $172.4 million in fiscal 2013, and $156.6 million in fiscal 2012.
Under the Massachusetts Constitution and state finance law, the State Treasurer has the authority to
delay the allotment of state aid appropriations under certain circumstances. In addition, the statute
governing the distribution of school aid provides that such payments are due only to the extent that
sufficient funds are available.
State School Building Assistance
Under its school building assistance program, the Commonwealth provides grants to cities, towns and
regional school districts for school construction projects. Until July 26, 2004, the State Board of Education
was responsible for approving grants for school projects and otherwise administering the program. Grant
amounts ranged from 50% to 90% of approved project costs. Municipalities generally issued bonds to
finance the entire project cost, and the Commonwealth disbursed the grants in equal annual installments
over the term of the related bonds. Approved project costs included the interest expense incurred on debt
issued by a municipality to finance the school project.
Due to demand for school building assistance grants far exceeding available funds, the state
legislature created the Massachusetts School Building Authority (“MSBA”) in 2004 to finance and
administer the school building assistance program. The MSBA has assumed all powers and obligations of
the State Board of Education with respect to the program. In addition to certain other amounts, the
legislation dedicates a portion of Commonwealth sales tax receipts to the MSBA to finance the program.

A-29

Projects previously approved for grants by the State Board of Education are entitled to receive grant
payments from the MSBA based on the approved project cost and reimbursement rate applicable under the
prior law. As of March 1, 2015, the City expects to receive $35.4 million in grant payments to offset its
outstanding debt service on school projects approved for grants under the prior law at a reimbursement rate
of 90% of approved project costs. The MSBA has paid and is expected to continue to pay the remaining
amounts of the grants for such projects in annual installments to reimburse debt service on bonds issued by
the City to finance such projects.
Projects on the State Board of Education’s project priority waiting list as of July 1, 2004 are also
entitled to receive grant payments from the MSBA based on the eligible project costs and reimbursement
rates applicable under the prior law. In 2005, the MSBA approved grants at a reimbursement rate of 90% of
approved project costs for three City projects on the priority waiting list as of July 1, 2004. In January
2009, the City and the MSBA executed a project funding agreement for Burke High School, the last City
school project on the priority waiting list as of July 1, 2004. The City has received approximately $40.7
million in Commonwealth support for the project.
The MSBA in 2008 promulgated regulations with respect to the application and approval process for
new projects. The range of reimbursement rates for such projects has been reduced to between 40% and
80% of approved project costs. In addition, the MSBA expects to pay grants for such projects as project
costs are incurred pursuant to a project funding agreement between the MSBA and the municipality. In
most cases, the receipt of these progress payments from the MSBA will eliminate the need for the
municipality to borrow on a temporary basis to finance the MSBA’s share of project costs. However, none
of the interest expense incurred on debt issued by municipalities to finance their portion of the costs of new
projects will be included in the approved project costs eligible for reimbursement.
Currently, one City school project is in the MSBA’s Feasibility Study phase to determine the most
appropriate, cost effective solution. Recently, the MSBA Board voted to invite the City to participate in its
so-called Eligibility Period for another school project. The Eligibility Period assists the MSBA with
managing its financial resources by identifying early in the process whether a School District is ready to
manage and fund a capital project. It will help determine a District’s financial and community readiness to
enter the capital pipeline. When the City completes the requirements of the Eligibility Period, the project
will move into the Feasibility Study phase. The ongoing analysis and consideration of the City’s project
proposal by the MSBA does not represent or imply a commitment by the MSBA to fund the project. The
MSBA’s financial commitment to a project is only determined through the project funding agreement after
careful analysis and the development of architectural and engineering documents. In 2014, the City entered
into a Project Funding Agreement for the construction of a new school in Roxbury. The City expects to
receive a grant totaling 75.34% of eligible project costs.
Excise Revenues
In addition to the major sources of revenue described above, the City receives various other types of
revenues. See “Financial Operations—Summary and Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary
Basis)—Fiscal 2011 to 2014 Actual Results and Fiscal 2015 Budget” above. In fiscal 2010 the City gained
one new significant excise revenue source (meals excise) and expanded an existing source (room
occupancy excise). The following is a description of those and other significant excise revenue sources of
the City.
Room Occupancy Excise
As is its option under state law approved in 1985, the City imposed a 4.0% local room occupancy
excise upon the transfer of occupancy of any room in a hotel, lodging house or motel. The Commonwealth
granted authority to municipalities in 2009 to increase the local option room occupancy excise up to 6.0%.
The City increased the local option room occupancy excise to 6.0%, effective October 1, 2009. The
Massachusetts Department of Revenue is responsible for collecting and remitting local option room
occupancy excise receipts to the City in arrears. The City’s room occupancy excise receipts totaled $60.1
million, $66.1 million and $71.1 million in fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Prior to fiscal 2012,
pursuant to Chapter 152 of the Acts of 1997, as amended (“Convention Center Act”), the City established
the City of Boston Room Occupancy Excise Fund (“Excise Fund”), to provide for the payment of the
principal and interest on indebtedness issued by the City to fund the City’s share of costs of the Boston
Convention and Exhibition Center Project (“BCEC Project”). The Convention Center Act authorizes the
City to retain in the Excise Fund any portion of room occupancy excise receipts not applied to such
principal and interest or to transfer all or a portion of such amount to the City’s General Fund (Vehicle
Rental Surcharge receipts below are also credited to this fund). The City transferred $30.0 million and

A-30

$34.5 million, in fiscal 2010 and 2011, respectively from the Excise Fund to the General Fund. All such
debt was refunded with general obligation debt issued in fiscal 2011. Accordingly, the Excise Fund has
been eliminated and since the beginning of fiscal 2012, all room occupancy excise receipts have been
credited directly to the General Fund.
Aircraft Fuel Excise
The City also assesses an aircraft fuel excise upon the sale of jet fuel. The Commonwealth collects
this tax and distributes it to the City. The City’s aircraft fuel excise receipts totaled $32.6 million, $36.6
million, and $37.1 million in fiscal 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively.
Motor Vehicle Excise
The Commonwealth assesses an excise on the registration of motor vehicles, the proceeds of which
are received by the municipality where the vehicle is principally garaged. The excise is a uniform rate of
$25 per $1,000 of vehicle valuation. The City’s annual motor vehicle excise receipts totaled $40.4 million,
$47.1 million, and $53.0 million in fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Meals Excise
The Commonwealth granted the option to municipalities in 2009 to levy a 0.75% excise on locally
sold prepared food and beverages. The Massachusetts Department of Revenue is responsible for collecting
and remitting meals excise receipts to the City. The City’s annual meals excise receipts totaled $22.0
million, $22.9 million, and $24.3 million in fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Vehicular Rental Surcharge
The Commonwealth imposes a $10 surcharge on each vehicular rental transaction contract in the
City. In fiscal 2011 and prior years, one dollar of each surcharge was paid to the City for deposit in the
City’s Excise Fund to provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on indebtedness issued by the
City to fund the City’s share of costs of the BCEC Project. The City’s annual share of vehicular rental
surcharges totaled $1.2 million, $1.4 million, and $1.1 million in fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Beginning in fiscal 2013, this revenue source is deposited in the General Fund due to the elimination of the
Excise Fund. See “City Indebtedness—Special Obligation Debt.”
Departmental Revenues
Several City departments generate significant revenues from fines, fees, charges and reimbursements.
Parking Fines
The City’s annual parking fine receipts totaled $61.0 million, $56.3 million, and $56.5 million in
fiscal 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively.
Building Permit Fees
The Inspectional Services Department performs a variety of functions for which fees are imposed
such as the granting of building permits. The City’s annual building permit fees totaled $32.6 million,
$29.2 million, and $40.1 million in fiscal 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively.
Municipal Medicaid Reimbursement
The Office of Budget Management oversees a vendor contract to collect federal reimbursements for
Medicaid eligible services provided through the Boston Public Schools. The City’s annual municipal
Medicaid reimbursement revenue totaled $8.1 million, $7.4 million, and $6.2 million in fiscal 2012, 2013,
and 2014, respectively.
Other Available Revenues
Under state law, proceeds of the sale of City facilities must be applied to the Surplus Property
Disposition Fund to be used to finance capital projects, unless the City Council, with the approval of the
Mayor, votes to credit to the General Fund the difference between the sale proceeds and the amount of debt
(both principal and interest) incurred in acquiring or improving the sold facility. As of June 30, 2014, there
was $9.9 million remaining in the Surplus Property Disposition Fund.

A-31

Grants
The City receives both federal and state grant funds, some of which are determined according to
formulas, and others that are awarded competitively. These monies are recorded in special revenue funds.
Federal Grants
Some major sources of federal grant funds in fiscal 2014 included: a Community Development Block
Grant (“CDBG”) Entitlement Program award of $16.8 million; a Home Investment Partnership Program
(“HOME”) award of $4.4 million; a Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (“HOPWA”)
award of $2.0 million and an Emergency Services Grant award of $1.2 million. The Department of
Neighborhood Development received an additional $37.2 million in federal competitive grants.
Major sources of federal grant funds for programs of the Boston Public Schools included: a Title I
Elementary & Secondary Education Act of 1965 award of $35.0 million; Special Education Entitlement
Grant awards of $18.6 million; School Lunch Program and Summer Food Program awards of $39.6
million; and Title II teacher quality award of $5.9 million. The Boston Public Schools were also awarded
$26.3 million from a variety of other federal grant sources during the 2014 fiscal year. Total federal aid to
Boston Public Schools in fiscal 2014 was $125.4 million compared to $124.5 million fiscal 2013.
State Grants
In addition to State Aid, the City also received state grants. In fiscal 2014, the Boston Police
Department received Community Services grant awards that totaled $5.0 million from the Massachusetts
Executive Office of Public Safety and Security.
Boston Public Schools were awarded approximately $6.7 million for early childhood, elementary and
secondary, and adult education. In addition, the state paid $14.1 million in Special Education
Reimbursement to the Boston school district.

CITY INDEBTEDNESS
Classification of City Debt
Direct general obligation debt of the City is debt for which the City’s full faith and credit are pledged
and for the payment of which all taxable property in the City is subject to ad valorem taxation without limit
as to rate or amount. General obligation bonds of the City may also be secured in certain circumstances by
a pledge of specific City revenues. The special obligation debt of the City is debt, which may be secured
solely by a pledge of specific revenues derived from a revenue-producing facility of the City or for the
payment of which the City’s obligation is subject to annual appropriation.
General Obligation Debt
On June 30, 2014, the City had outstanding approximately $1.20 billion of general obligation longterm bonds, all of which bear fixed rates of interest. On March 1, 2015, the City had approximately $1.14
billion of general obligation long-term bonds outstanding.
The City is authorized to secure any of its general obligation indebtedness by a pledge of all or any
part of any revenues of the City including, without limitation, any tax, such as real property taxes, any fees
payable to or for the account of the City, and certain receipts, distributions and reimbursements held or to
be received by the City from the Commonwealth. The City currently has no general obligation bonds or
notes outstanding secured by such a pledge.
Debt Limits
All debt of the City requires the authorization of the City Council and approval of the Mayor. If the
Mayor vetoes a loan order passed by the City Council, the charter of the City provides that the loan order is
void and may not be passed over the Mayor’s veto. Authorization of bonds under a loan order of the City
Council includes, unless otherwise provided, the authorization to issue temporary notes in anticipation of
such bonds.
The statutory debt limit for the City consists of a debt limit and a double debt limit. The debt limit is
5%, and the double debt limit is 10%, of the valuation of taxable property in the City as last equalized by
the State Department of Revenue. Biennially, prior to January 31st, the Commissioner of Revenue
establishes a final equalized valuation which is the basis for determining the debt limit for the following
two-year period or until another equalization has been established. The equalized valuation of taxable
property in the City established by the Commissioner of Revenue in January 2015 equals $110.81 billion.
Based on the current equalized valuation, the City’s debt limit equals approximately $5.54 billion, and its
double debt limit equals $11.08 billion as of March 1, 2015.
The City may authorize debt up to its debt limit without state approval. The City may authorize debt
over the debt limit up to the double debt limit with the approval of the Municipal Finance Oversight Board,
composed of the State Treasurer and Receiver-General, the State Auditor, the Attorney General and the
Director of Accounts. As of June 30, 2014, the City had outstanding debt of $1.04 billion subject to the
debt limit, and authorized but unissued debt subject to the debt limit of $551.0 million. As of March 1,
2015, the City had outstanding debt of $994.3 million subject to the debt limit, and authorized but unissued
debt subject to the debt limit of $837.5 million. Based on the City’s current debt limit of $5.54 billion, the
City had the capacity to authorize an additional $3.71 billion of debt as of March 1, 2015.

There are many categories of general obligation debt which are not subject to the debt limit and are
therefore not included in the Debt Incurring Capacity table above. Some such debt is, however, subject to
other debt limits, dollar limitations or state approval. As of March 1, 2015, the City had a total of $1.14
billion in long-term debt outstanding, of which $142.8 million was exempt from the debt limit. As of that
date the City also had $80.7 million of long-term debt that was authorized but unissued and exempt from
the debt limit.

Short-Term Borrowings
Although the City is authorized to borrow for operating purposes through the issuance of short-term
notes in anticipation of revenue receipts, it has not done so in several years. In addition, the City is
authorized to issue short-term debt obligations or Bond Anticipation Notes (“BANs”) in anticipation of the
issuance of long-term bonds. Currently, no BANs are outstanding.
Special Obligation Debt
In addition to general obligation indebtedness, the Bond Procedure Act of 1983 and various other
special acts authorize the City to incur indebtedness which is secured by and payable solely from certain
revenues of the City which are pledged for the payment of such indebtedness or which are subject to annual
appropriation by the City for such purpose. As of March 1, 2015, the City has no Special Obligation debt.
Debt of Agencies Related to the City
In addition to general obligation and special obligation indebtedness of the City, the City and certain
agencies related to the City are authorized to issue debt which is solely an obligation of the agency or
which, although issued by the City, are payable solely from revenues derived from projects financed by
such debt. Except as described below, such obligations do not constitute a debt of the City.
A-36

Boston Water and Sewer Commission
The Boston Water and Sewer Commission (“BWSC”) is an independent body politic and corporate
and a political subdivision of the Commonwealth created in July 1977. The BWSC, among its other
powers, is authorized to operate and maintain the water and sewer systems of the City, construct
improvements to the systems, collect user charges for its services, and finance its activities and its
borrowing through its revenues. The City is not obligated on debt issued by the BWSC. The BWSC’s user
charges, as required by statute, are designed to produce revenues to the BWSC sufficient to pay all of its
current operating expenses. These user charges are anticipated to increase moderately. The City’s property
tax base is not used to subsidize water and sewer services.
Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston
The Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston (“EDIC”) is a body politic and
corporate and an instrumentality of the Commonwealth with a board of five members, also appointed as the
members of the Boston Redevelopment Authority (“BRA”). EDIC has a variety of powers to assist
industrial development projects in the City including the power to issue special obligation revenue bonds to
finance economic development projects in the City, which are solely the obligation of EDIC, or the owner
or lessee of the financed project. The City is also authorized to appropriate or borrow monies in aid of
EDIC development projects within certain urban renewal debt limitations.
Boston Redevelopment Authority
The BRA is a public body politic and corporate constituting the City’s redevelopment authority. It
acts as the City’s planning board and exercises certain powers of the state Department of Housing and
Community Development. The BRA board consists of four members appointed by the Mayor, subject to
confirmation by the City Council, and one appointed by the state Department of Housing and Community
Development. The staff includes architects, economists, engineers, lawyers and urban planners, as well as
management personnel and administrative support. The BRA provides the planning support for major
construction, development and redevelopment activity in the City. Although the BRA is authorized to issue
revenue bonds and notes which would not constitute indebtedness of the City, BRA projects have
traditionally been financed through a combination of federal and state grants, the proceeds of general
obligation bonds issued by the City and revenues from the lease or sale of land.
Boston Public Health Commission
The Boston Public Health Commission (“BPHC”) is a body politic and corporate and a political
subdivision of the Commonwealth created in June 1996 as the successor to the City’s Department of Health
and Hospitals. See “The City—Principal Government Services—Public Health.” The BPHC is responsible
for the implementation of public health programs in the City and serves as the board of health of the City.
In addition to its other powers, the BPHC is authorized by its enabling act, with the approval of the City
Council and the Mayor, to borrow money for any of its corporate purposes from the City or from the
Massachusetts Health and Educational Facilities Authority. Debt of the BPHC is not a debt or other
obligation of the City. The BPHC has no debt currently outstanding.
The BPHC is also obligated to reimburse the City for debt service paid on all outstanding general
obligation bonds of the City issued for public health and hospital purposes, which was paid in full in fiscal
2015. The BPHC has required, and can be expected to continue to require, substantial financial support
from the City to maintain its public health mission and programs, including satisfaction of its obligations
described above.
Other Agencies and Corporations
Two other public bodies are empowered, either by themselves or through the City, to issue special
obligation revenue bonds. The Boston Housing Authority (“BHA”) is responsible for the construction,
financing and operation of residential housing for low-income persons. While the City provides certain
municipal services to BHA developments, and capital expenditures for City infrastructure related to those
developments, the City is not directly or indirectly liable for operating or debt service expenses of the
BHA. The City, acting by and through the Boston Industrial Development Financing Authority, is
authorized to issue revenue bonds to finance the construction of industrial, commercial and pollutioncontrol facilities. The City has also traditionally provided financial assistance to a number of nonprofit
corporations organized to provide and conduct civic and charitable functions for residents and visitors to
the City and to stimulate the economic development of the City.

A-37

In addition, two new nonprofit corporations, the Dudley Square Realty Corporation (“DSRC”) and
the Ferdinand Building Development Corporation (“FBDC”), were formed by the City in October 2011 in
order to make the Dudley Municipal Building Project — now substantially complete and named the Bruce
C. Bolling Building — eligible for New Market Tax Credit (“NMTC”) financing. DSRC and FBDC are
under the control of the City. The City’s capital budget and general obligation bond proceeds were still the
primary project funding source, but in order to reduce City general obligation funding for the building by
approximately $8 million, all funding flowed through the NMTC financing structure and until the time of
retirement of NMTC loans, ownership of the building is retained by DSRC, with FBDC as sublandlord to
the City (for the BPS occupied space) and to the limited amount of commercially leased space. Lease
payments due by the City for the BPS occupied space flow to DSRC, which utilizes the payments to pay
for the project’s NMTC qualified low-income community investment loans. The annual lease payment is
reflected in the City’s general obligation debt service requirements.
Major Contractual Obligations
In addition to its debt obligations, the City has substantial contractual obligations. Included in this
category are the City’s obligation for pension benefit payments to its contributory retirement system for
City employees and other post employment benefits which is included in the annual tax levy (see
“Employee Benefits”); agreements for the provision of sanitation, solid waste collection and disposal
services (see “The City—Principal Government Services—Public Works”); and agreements with BMCC
for the provision of operating assistance (see “City Indebtedness—Special Obligation Debt” and “Debt of
Agencies Related to the City—Boston Public Health Commission” above). The City has also executed
several equipment lease agreements in order to finance the acquisition of departmental equipment. As of
March 1, 2015, the amount outstanding under the lease agreements equals $67.1 million. Lease payments
are subject to annual appropriation and are not included in the City’s debt limit.
Capital Planning and Borrowing Program
Capital Planning Process
The capital planning process coincides with the annual budget cycle and provides an opportunity for
City departments to identify their facility, equipment, infrastructure, technology and planning needs in a
systematic manner and to forward their proposals to the Office of Budget Management (“OBM”) for
funding consideration. The first phase concludes with the release of an updated five-year capital plan
published as part of the City’s annual budget document. The process allows for a continuing reassessment
of capital needs. On April 9, 2014, the Mayor submitted his fiscal 2015 budget to the City Council and filed
$289.7 million in new capital authorizations which were subsequently approved by the City Council.
Capital Funding Plan
The City funds its capital plan primarily through general obligation bonds and external grants. The
City awards construction contracts and incurs capital outlay costs based upon appropriations to be funded
from bond proceeds and grant receipts. In circumstances where project expenditures occur prior to the
receipt of bond proceeds or grant reimbursements, the City temporarily pays such costs from available
funds.
Current Capital Investment Plans
The City’s fiscal 2015-2019 capital plan proposes long-term investments over the next five years. In
all, $1.8 billion from City and non-City sources are proposed to be spent on capital projects. These
expenditures will be used for improvements to schools, libraries, parks, community centers, roads, bridges,
street lights and other City-owned facilities and infrastructure.
The fiscal 2015-2019 capital plan includes projects that improve the physical condition of schools,
parks, community centers, libraries, public safety facilities and equipment across the City. Major
renovation work is underway on several school buildings. Significant investment in the City’s technology
infrastructure and business applications is evident with the implementation of a new computer-aideddispatch system for public safety departments, a new enterprise energy management system, and a major
upgrade to its Human Resources system.
In December 2014, substantial completion was achieved in the construction of the Bruce C. Bolling
Building—a 215,000-square-foot multi-story municipal office facility with street level retail and public
assembly space—which incorporates the facades of the historic Ferdinand Furniture Building and two other
late 19th century buildings and serves as the new administrative headquarters for Boston Public Schools

A-38

(“BPS”). The project represents the first major new construction of a City of Boston government office
facility since 1967, and shall extend relevant services in a location that is accessible, efficient, and iconic.
The maintenance of the City’s roadways and sidewalks is a significant part of the capital plan. In
fiscal 2014, 45.0 miles of roads were reconstructed or resurfaced and 18.3 miles of bike lanes were added.
The City continued replacing mercury and sodium vapor street lights with LED street lights, installing over
8,770 lights in fiscal 2014, with plans to continue to retrofit the City’s streetlights in fiscal 2015. In view of
the economic and social benefits of consistent, long-range capital planning, the City remains committed to
implementing its capital program.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Retirement Systems
Employees of the City of Boston are not participants in the Federal Social Security system; instead,
the City participates in a contributory defined benefit retirement system that is administered by the StateBoston Retirement System (“SBRS” or “system”). The SBRS is a governmental pension plan as defined by
federal law and is governed by the provisions of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32. The SBRS is
administered by a five member board: the City Auditor, who serves ex-officio; two individuals elected by
members of the system; an individual chosen by the Mayor; and an individual chosen by the other four
members or appointed by the Mayor if the other four members do not agree on a selection within 30 days
of a vacancy. Retirement payments are issued on a monthly basis and payments are funded through a
combination of mandatory deductions from current employees, employer contributions, Commonwealth
appropriations and investment earnings.
In addition to appropriation payments to cover current and future benefit payments of City employees
covered by the SBRS, the City funds noncontributory retirement benefits for pensioners whose
employment predates the SBRS, certain veterans who meet certain state law requirements, former
employees retired under Massachusetts Special Acts and families receiving killed-in-the-line-of-duty
benefits. As of January 2015, the City is providing such benefits to 82 pensioners; these benefits are funded
on a pay-as-you-go basis with monthly pension payments of approximately $298,000.
On December 4, 2008, the City, SBRS, the Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission
(“PERAC”), and the Commonwealth entered into a memorandum of agreement to transfer the direct
responsibility for funding the liability of Boston teachers’ pensions to the Commonwealth effective fiscal
2010; legislation mirroring this agreement was signed into law on May 22, 2010. Among the significant
transactions which took place shortly after passage of the legislation were: a) the SBRS transferred 27% of
the market value of its assets to the Pension Reserve Investment Trust (“PRIT”) Fund as the portion of
SBRS assets related to Boston teacher pension liability according to a valuation accepted by all parties in
the aforementioned memorandum of agreement, and b) the last reimbursement originally scheduled to go to
the City's General Fund, $126.9 million, was directly deposited with the SBRS to reduce the SBRS—
Excluding Teachers unfunded liability. The SBRS continues to administer pension services for all Boston
teacher employees, retirees and beneficiaries. The legislation eliminated the three-party
(SBRS/Commonwealth/City of Boston) transaction, based partly on outdated pay-as-you-go methodology,
and replaced it with a more financially sound two party (SBRS/Commonwealth) transaction that clarifies
ownership of the liability and is based upon current year, actuarially calculated funding.
Chapter 61 of the Acts of 2009, as amended, transferred approximately 1,000 employees of the
Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department to the Commonwealth effective January 1, 2010. All current and
future Suffolk County Sheriff employees became members of the State Retirement System and are now the
fiscal responsibility of the Commonwealth. Former employees of the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department,
who retired prior to January 1, 2010, remain members of the SBRS and their respective pension liability
remains the obligation of the City.
The following table reflects amounts expended or budgeted by the City for pension payments for
fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2014. These numbers include contributions for both contributory and noncontributory members.

City of Boston

The actuarial accrued liabilities of the SBRS exceed the actuarial value of the assets of the SBRS. As
part of the change in the funding of the Boston teachers’ pension liability described above, the last three
SBRS actuarial valuations include separate valuations for teachers and for all other SBRS members
(“SBRS—Excluding Teachers”), includes all non-teacher City of Boston employees and retirees plus
employees of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, BHA, Boston Public Health Commission and the
Boston Water and Sewer Commission. The City’s annual operating budget includes an amount to be
expended for pension liability payments by the Boston Public Health Commission; however, the City is not
responsible for such contributions for the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the Boston Housing Authority
and/or the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. The City’s annual pension contributions constitute its
share of the annual required contribution to SBRS—Excluding Teachers.
The following table summarizes the results of the last four actuarial valuations for SBRS—Excluding
Teachers. The information presented in the following table differs from that shown on page A-67 of the
City's audited financial statements attached hereto as Exhibit I to Appendix A because the information
shown on page A-67 includes assets and liabilities relating to teachers’ pensions, which are now an
obligation of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. See Note 11 d. to the City's audited financial statements
attached hereto as Exhibit I to Appendix A.

The most recent actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2014 is incorporated herein by reference and is
available at http://www.cityofboston.gov/retirement/investment.asp. The January 1, 2014 valuation
assumes a long-term rate of return of 7.75% for SBRS—Excluding Teachers assets. The long-term rate of
return assumption was lowered from 8.00% to 7.75% beginning with the January 1, 2012 valuation. The
actuarial valuation of assets is determined annually by recognizing 20% of gains or losses, and to the extent
necessary, by also recognizing any additional portion of gains or losses, which keeps the actuarial valuation
of assets between 80% and 120% of market value. The net effect is a smoother trend of annual pension
funding during volatile short-term periods of asset gains or losses. The following table shows the market
and actuarial value of the plan’s non-teacher assets.

As of December 31, 2014, the estimated market value of assets not held for teacher benefit payments
was approximately $4.11 billion. This amount is an estimate based upon then current market values of
certain assets held by SBRS and prior period values for certain other assets for which the current market
value is not readily ascertainable. This amount is unaudited and subject to change. It should be noted that
the annual required contribution of the City is based, in part, upon the actuarial value of assets, not market
values. This is commonly done in computing annual funding requirements in order to prevent extreme
fluctuations that might otherwise arise from temporary or cyclical economic and market conditions.
In accordance with Chapter 68 of the Acts of 2007, the state regulatory agency for pensions, PERAC,
annually reviews investment performance and funded ratio of systems as of January 1st. If a system is: (i)
less than 65% funded, and (ii) has trailed the investment performance of the PRIT fund by 2% or more on
an average annualized basis over the previous ten year period, PERAC will declare the system
underperforming and the system shall transfer its assets to the PRIT fund. For reasons unrelated to Chapter
68, the SBRS–Teachers assets are invested in the PRIT fund; the SBRS–All Other is currently funded at
70.2%.
For additional information concerning a comparison of the market value of assets and investment
return to the actuarial value of assets and investment return for the period 2004 through 2013, see Exhibit G
in Section 4 of the January 1, 2014 actuarial valuation referenced above. The City is currently committed to
a funding schedule for fiscal 2013, 2014, and 2015 that is based on the most recent actuarial valuation,
incorporating asset and liability data as of January 1, 2014. The funding schedule is calculated in
accordance with the entry age actuarial cost method and includes paying the current year’s present value of
benefits earned during the year (“normal cost”) and an annual contribution toward reducing the unfunded
liability of the SBRS 15 years ahead of the required deadline of 2040.
Many variables are in play with each new valuation, and the actuary’s recommendations and
consultation with the City are part of a careful planning process that precedes the SBRS final approval of
the valuation and funding schedule. The 2014 actuarial valuation adjusted the mortality tables to better
reflect longer life expectancies. Beginning in 2012, the SBRS lowered the investment long-term rate of
return assumption from 8.0% to 7.75%. In the 2012 valuation, assumptions were adjusted to reflect an
increase to the retiree Cost of Living Adjustment (“COLA”) base from $12,000 to $13,000 as of July 1,
2012 and an increase to the minimum annual pension allowance from $3,000 to $6,000 effective Dec. 21,
2012. The funding schedule also assumes a similar COLA will be approved in future years. Additional
adjustments were made for the 2012 valuation to increase the assumed rates of disability by 25% for public
safety officers and to decrease the assumed rates of disability by 50% for non-public safety officers; these
changes to the assumed rates of disability better reflect past experience and future expectations.
The City currently expects to fully amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability by June 30, 2025.
Chart 2-16 of the January 1, 2014 actuarial valuation sets forth the funding schedule from 2015 through
2025 for the SBRS, excluding teachers. The City’s share of the employer contributions shown in this
schedule is approximately 82%, down from a long-term average of approximately 90%, due to the direct
credit, amortized over the long-term, received by the City for extraordinary contributions and deposits
during fiscal 2011, and as part of the Boston Teacher Pension MOA and legislation. Accordingly, based
upon this schedule, which is subject to change as future circumstances change, the City’s contributions for
the amortization of the unfunded liability are estimated to increase from $172.5 million in fiscal 2015 to
$356.0 million in fiscal 2024. The City’s total employer contributions each year will also include the
normal costs for each year. This schedule is illustrative only of the currently expected funding schedule.
The actual funding schedule will be different due to the actual circumstances that will occur and that will
likely vary from the assumptions used in the January 1, 2014 valuation. The City’s current pension funding
schedule, with its conservative salary growth assumptions, is sufficient to absorb the long term impacts of
collective bargaining awards. The funding schedule assumes a 4.5% salary growth assumption for general
service employees, a 4.75% salary growth assumption for certain employees with hazardous occupations,
and a 5.0% salary growth assumption for public safety officers. The City’s pension liability is reevaluated
every two years and adjustments are made to the funding schedule, as needed.
In June 2012, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) issued GASB Statement No.
68, which sets forth new standards that will modify the accounting and financial reporting of the City’s
pension obligations. The new standard for governments that provide employee pension benefits will require
the City to report in its statement of net position a net pension liability, defined as the difference between
the total pension liability (the present value of projected benefit payments to employees based on their past
service) and the assets (mostly investments reported at fair value) set aside in a trust and restricted to
paying benefits to current employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. The new standard will require

A-41

immediate recognition of more pension expense than is currently required. The rate used to discount
projected benefit payments to their present value will be based on a single rate that reflects (a) the longterm expected rate of return on plan investments as long as the plan net position is projected under
specified conditions to be sufficient to pay pensions of current employees and retirees and the pension plan
assets are expected to be invested using a strategy to achieve that return and (b) a yield or index rate based
on tax-exempt 20-year AA or higher rated municipal bonds to the extent that the conditions for use of the
long-term expected rate of return are not met. The new standard will be effective for the City’s fiscal 2015.
The SBRS is committed to the transparency and accuracy of the fund. Therefore, the SBRS contracts
an outside audit firm to conduct an annual audit of the system. Additional information on the SBRS,
including the most recent actuarial valuation reports and audited financial statements can be found at
http://www.cityofboston.gov/retirement/investment.asp. See also Note 11 to the City’s fiscal 2014 audited
financial statements attached hereto as Exhibit I.
Other Postemployment Benefits
In addition to the pension benefits described above, the City provides postemployment health care
and life insurance benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis to approximately 14,900 City (including teachers) and
Boston Public Health Commission (“BPHC”) participating retirees and their beneficiaries. It is projected
that the City will pay benefits (net of retiree contributions) on behalf of current retired employees of
approximately $124 million in fiscal 2015, on a pay-as-you-go basis, as compared to $115 million in fiscal
2014.
GASB Statement No. 43, Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefit Plans Other Than Pension
Plans, and GASB Statement No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for
Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions, became effective June 30, 2007, and June 30, 2008,
respectively. These statements require the City to account for and report the value of its future other
postemployment benefit (“OPEB”) obligations.
In compliance with these reporting requirements, the City provides an independent actuarial
valuation. In fiscal 2008, the City began voluntary annual appropriations to reduce its OPEB liability.
Aggregate City appropriations since this time through fiscal 2014 total $215 million. The City appropriated
an additional $40 million in fiscal 2015. Annual appropriations are retained in an irrevocable Trust Fund,
which is authorized through the City’s acceptance of M.G.L. Chapter 32B section 20, and is under a Trust
Agreement between the City and the City’s Collector-Treasurer as trustee and custodian. A separate OPEB
trust fund has also been established by the BPHC and $7.0 million has been deposited through fiscal 2014.
The BPHC deposited an additional $2.25 million in fiscal 2015. The City has procured investment
consulting services in order to optimize investment of the OPEB Trust Funds. The aggregate amount on
deposit in the OPEB Trust Funds as of December 31, 2014 was $331 million.
An independent actuarial valuation of the City’s OPEB obligations at June 30, 2013, estimated that
the total OPEB unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the City and the BPHC as of that date on account of
then current retirees, beneficiaries, dependents and current active members was $2.14 billion, based on
current funding polices. In fiscal 2014, the City changed the manner in which the projected unit credit
actuarial cost method was applied to estimate the OPEB liability. The City currently accrues OPEB benefits
earned over the estimated working life of the employee (previously, benefits earned were accrued through
the date of initial benefit eligibility). Such change was made to achieve greater comparability with other
municipalities within the Commonwealth. The change in methodology was retroactively applied to past
actuarial valuations to re-estimate the net OPEB obligation of the City and the BPHC. As a result of this
revision, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability as of June 30, 2011 was restated from $3.06 billion to
$2.60 billion.
Even with the aforementioned change in actuarial method, the projected liability decreased
significantly from the last valuation, partially due to an increased discount rate from 7.25% to 7.50% for
the City. The BPHC discount rate remained at 5.75%. Additionally, the 2013 valuation was impacted due
to the decrease in per capita health insurance costs resulting from the passage of Massachusetts Municipal
Healthcare reform by the state legislature. This 2011 legislation revised Section 18A of Chapter 32B,
requiring all Medicare-eligible retirees enroll in Medicare plans, resulting in approximately 40% of retirees
switching from non-Medicare plans into lower-cost Medicare plans. In April 2011, the City and its unions
signed a four-year agreement through June 30, 2015, establishing a Public Employee Committee (“PEC”)
pursuant to MGL Chapter 32B, Section 19, also known as “coalition bargaining,” which brought the City
together with its unions and resulted in greater employee and retiree cost sharing of health care costs. The
PEC agreed to a phased-in 2.5% increase in contributions for active employees and non-Medicare retirees,
reduced the City’s premium share to 72.5% of Blue Cross/Blue Shield premiums and 82.5% of HMO
A-42

premiums, and agreed to plan design changes which increased member cost sharing, and a 1% increase in
the retiree contributions to Medicare plans effective at the expiration of the agreement. Overall health
insurance costs were also lowered due to moving almost 90% of claims costs to self-insurance, a
comprehensive enrollment audit, and competitively bidding all non-Medicare health plans. In January
2015, the City and its unions successfully signed a second five-year PEC agreement that builds on the
changes agreed to under the first agreement. The parties have agreed to a health insurance framework for
the next five years that will consolidate and modify the number of plan options for active and retired
employees and change plan copayments (phased-in 2% increase) and premium splits.
In fiscal 2015, the City and BPHC are projected to fund 98.8% of the $168.3 million annual required
contribution, through a $124.1 million payment for current retiree benefits, and a $42.3 million contribution
to the Trust Funds.
Additional information regarding the City’s OPEB obligations may be found in the “Actuarial
Valuation & Review of Other Postemployment Benefits (“OPEB”) as of June 30, 2013,” available at
http://www.cityofboston.gov/administrationfinance. This document, dated August 26, 2014, replaces the
original valuation report dated February 13, 2014, and reflects the change in methodology described above.
AVAILABILITY OF OTHER INFORMATION
The City’s Auditing Department prepares a Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (“CAFR”) with
respect to each fiscal year ended June 30 which generally becomes available in December of the following
fiscal year. The CAFR is presented in three sections: (1) an Introductory Section which includes general
information about the City and summarizes financial activity for the fiscal year; (2) a Financial Section

Independent Auditors’ Report

To the Honorable Mayor and City Council
City of Boston, Massachusetts:
Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the aggregate
discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of
the City of Boston, Massachusetts (the City), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2014, and the related
notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements as listed
in the table of contents.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation,
and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We did not audit
the financial statements of the Dudley Square Realty Corporation, the Ferdinand Building Development
Corporation, and the City’s Permanent Funds, which represent 5.8% and .4% of the assets and revenues of
the governmental activities, respectively, and 1.5% and .8% of the assets and revenues of the aggregate
remaining fund information, respectively. We also did not audit the financial statements of the StateBoston Retirement System and the City’s OPEB Trust Fund and Private-Purpose Trust Funds, which
represent 96.6% and 80.6% of the assets and revenues of the aggregate remaining fund information,
respectively. Further, we did not audit the financial statements of the Trustees of the Public Library of the
City of Boston and the Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston, which represent
28.4% and 20.9% of the assets and revenues of the aggregate discretely presented component units,
respectively. Those financial statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to
us, and our opinions, insofar as they relate to the amounts included for those entities, is based solely on the
reports of the other auditors. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in
Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal
control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of

(“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity.

A-2 • City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinions.
Opinions
In our opinion, based on our audit and the reports of the other auditors, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental
activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate
remaining fund information of the City, as of June 30, 2014, and the respective changes in financial
position, and where applicable, cash flows thereof and the budgetary comparison for the City’s General
Fund for the year then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Emphasis of Matters
Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement
As discussed in Note 2n to the financial statements, in 2014, the City adopted Governmental Accounting
Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities. Our
opinions are not modified with respect to this matter.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 2n to the financial statements, the City has elected to change its application of the
actuarial cost method used in its accounting and financial reporting of other post-employment benefits in
2014. Our opinions are not modified with respect to this matter.
Other Matters
Prior-Year Comparative Information
The financial statements include partial prior-year comparative information related to the budgetary
comparison for the City’s General Fund. Such information does not include all of the information required
for a presentation in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, such
information should be read in conjunction with the City’s financial statements for the year ended June 30,
2013, from which such partial information was derived.
Required Supplementary Information
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that the management’s discussion and analysis and
the schedules of funding progress and employer contributions, as listed in the table of contents, be
presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic
financial statements, is required by the GASB who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting
for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We
and other auditors have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of
inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information
for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other
knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or
provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient
evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

Independent Auditors’ Report • A-3

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated December 23,
2014 on our consideration of the City’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters.
The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting
and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over
financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance
with Government Auditing Standards in considering the City’s internal control over financial reporting and
compliance.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
(Unaudited)
The City of Boston (the City) provides this Management’s Discussion and Analysis to present additional information to
the readers of the City’s basic financial statements. This narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the
City is for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. Readers are encouraged to consider this information in conjunction with
the additional information that is furnished in the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR).

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the City’s financial statements. The City’s basic
financial statements include three components: 1) Government-wide Financial Statements, 2) Fund Financial
Statements, and 3) Notes to the Financial Statements. This report also contains required supplementary information
regarding historical pension information and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plan information. The components
of the financial statements are described in the following sections.
Basic Financial Statements
The basic financial statements include two types of financial statements that present different views of the City – the
Government-wide Financial Statements and the Fund Financial Statements. The Notes to the Basic Financial Statements
supplement the financial statement information and clarify line items that are part of the financial statements.
Government-wide Financial Statements
The Government-wide Financial Statements provide a broad view of the City’s operations in a manner similar to a private
sector business. The statements provide both short-term and long-term information about the City’s financial position,
which assists in assessing the City’s economic condition at the end of the fiscal year. These are prepared using the
economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. This basically means they follow methods
that are similar to those used by most businesses. They take into account all revenues and expenses connected with the
fiscal year even if cash involved has not been received or paid. The Government-wide Financial Statements include two
statements:
•
The Statement of Net Position presents all of the government’s assets and liabilities, with the difference
between the two reported as net position. Over time, increases or decreases in the City’s net position may serve as a
useful indicator of whether the financial position of the City is improving or deteriorating.
•
The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the government’s net position changed during
the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the
change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this
statement for some items that will not result in cash flows until future fiscal periods (such as uncollected taxes and
earned but unused vacation leave). This statement also presents a comparison between direct expenses and program
revenues for each function of the City.
Both the above financial statements present two separate sections as described below.

Management’s Discussion & Analysis • A-5

•
Governmental Activities – The activities in this section are mostly supported by taxes and intergovernmental
revenues (federal and state grants). Most services normally associated with city government fall into this category,
including general government, human services, public safety, public works, property and development, parks and
recreation, library, schools, public health programs, state and district assessments, and debt service.
•
Discretely Presented Component Units – These are legally separate entities for which the City has financial
accountability but function independent of the City. For the most part, these entities operate similar to private sector
businesses. The City’s four discretely presented component units are the Boston Public Health Commission, the Boston
Redevelopment Authority, the Economic Development Industrial Corporation, and the Trustees of the Boston Public
Library.
Complete financial statements of the individual component units can be obtained from their respective administrative
offices. Additional information about the City’s component units is presented in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
The Government-wide Financial Statements can be found immediately following this discussion and analysis.
Fund Financial Statements
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for
specific activities or objectives. The City, like other local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate
compliance with finance-related legal requirements.
The Fund Financial Statements focus on individual parts of the City government, reporting the City’s operations in more
detail than the Government-wide Financial Statements. All of the funds of the City can be divided into three categories.
It is important to note that these fund categories use different accounting approaches and should be interpreted
differently. The three categories of funds are:
Governmental Funds – Most of the basic services provided by the City are financed through governmental funds.
Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in the
Government-wide Financial Statements. However, unlike the Government-wide Financial Statements, the Governmental
Fund Financial Statements focus on near term inflows and outflows of spendable resources. They also focus on the
balances of spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in evaluating the
government’s near term financing requirements. This approach is known as using the flow of current financial resources
measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this approach, revenues are recorded when
cash is received or when susceptible to accrual (i.e., measurable and available to liquidate liabilities of the current
period). Expenditures are generally recorded when liabilities are incurred, except for those related to long-term
liabilities, which are recorded when due and payable. These statements provide a detailed short term view of the City’s
finances to assist in determining whether there will be adequate financial resources available to meet the current needs
of the City.
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the Government-wide Financial Statements, it is
useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for
governmental activities in the Government-wide Financial Statements. By doing so, readers may better understand the
long term impact of the government’s near term financing decisions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the
governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to

A-6 • City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and the governmental activities. These reconciliations are
presented on the page immediately following each governmental fund financial statement.
The City presents four columns in the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of
revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances. The City’s three major governmental funds are the General Fund,
the Special Revenue Fund, and the Capital Projects Fund. All non-major governmental funds are combined in the “Other
Governmental Funds” column on these statements. The Governmental Fund Financial Statements can be found
immediately following the Government-wide Financial Statements.
Of the City’s governmental funds, the General Fund is the only fund for which a budget is legally adopted. The Statement
of Revenues and Expenditures – Budgetary Basis is presented after the governmental fund financial statements. This
statement provides a comparison of the General Fund original and final budget and the actual expenditures for the
current and prior year on a budgetary basis.
In accordance with state law and regulations, the City’s legally adopted General Fund budget is prepared on a
“budgetary” basis instead of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Among the key differences between
these two sets of accounting principles are that “budgetary” records property tax as it is levied, while GAAP records it as
it becomes susceptible to accrual, “budgetary” records certain activities and transactions in the General Fund that GAAP
records in separate funds, and “budgetary” records any amount raised that covers a prior year deficit as an expenditure
and any available funds raised from prior year surpluses as a revenue, while GAAP ignores these impacts from prior
years. The difference in accounting principles inevitably leads to varying results in excess or deficiency of revenues over
expenditures. Additional information and a reconciliation of “budgetary” to GAAP statements is provided in note 4 to
the Financial Statements.
Proprietary Funds – These funds are used to show activities that operate more like those of commercial enterprises.
Like the Government-wide Financial Statements, Proprietary Fund Financial Statements use the economic resources
measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting. There are two types of proprietary funds – enterprise funds and
internal service funds. Enterprise funds charge fees for services provided to outside customers including local
governments. Enterprise Funds provide the same type of information as the business-type activities of the Governmentwide Financial Statements within governmental activities, only in more detail. Currently, the City does not have any
enterprise funds. The Internal Service Fund provides health insurance services predominantly to other funds,
departments or agencies of the City. Therefore, its activities are included in the Government-wide financial statements
within governmental activities. The Proprietary Funds Financial Statements can be found immediately following the
Governmental Fund Financial Statements.
Fiduciary Funds– These funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the City
government. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the Government-wide Financial Statements because the resources of
these funds are not available to support the City’s own programs. The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much like
that used for proprietary funds. They use the economic resources measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting.
The City’s fiduciary funds are the Employee Retirement Fund (the State-Boston Retirement System), which accounts for
the transactions, assets, liabilities, and net position of the City employees’ pension plan; the OPEB Trust Fund, which is
an irrevocable trust established for the accumulation of assets to reduce the unfunded actuarial liability associated with

Management’s Discussion & Analysis • A-7

the City’s obligation for other postemployment benefits; and the Private Purpose Trust and Agency Funds, which include
money held and administered by the City on behalf of third parties.
The Fiduciary Funds Financial Statements can be found immediately following the Proprietary Fund Financial
Statements.
Notes to the Financial Statements
The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the
Government-wide and the Fund Financial Statements. The Notes to the Financial Statements can be found immediately
following the Fiduciary Funds Financial Statements.
Required Supplementary Information
The basic financial statements are followed by a section of required supplementary information, which includes a
schedule of funding progress and a schedule of employer contributions for the State-Boston Retirement System and the
OPEB Trust Fund.

CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL IMPACTS
•

The City of Boston’s OPEB obligation significantly impacts the government-wide financial results. Each year, the City
is required to recognize an additional portion of its unfunded actuarial accrued liability. The most recent valuation of
the City’s OPEB obligations as of June 30, 2013, estimated that the total OPEB unfunded actuarial accrued liability of
the City decreased by $860.0 million to $2.05 billion. This decrease was largely as a result of changes to the discount
rate based on the City’s funding policy and a result of a change in the application of the Projected Unit Credit cost
method to allocate benefits through an employee’s expected retirement age. Refer to note 2n of the Financial
Statements for more information.

 In fiscal year 2014, the City’s contribution to the OPEB Trust Fund ($153.6 million) for retiree health benefits
includes $40.0 million in advance funding toward reducing the unfunded actuarial accrued liability and also met the
annual required contribution (ARC) of $153.5 million. In fiscal year 2015, the City has also appropriated $40.0 million
in advance funding toward reducing the unfunded actuarial accrued liability.

GOVERNMENT-WIDE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
This analysis is based on the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities found directly after
Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
Government-wide Highlights
Net Position – Primary Government – The total assets of the City exceeded its liabilities at fiscal year ended June 30,
2014 by $603.1 million (presented as net position). At year end, the City had a surplus in governmental activities
unrestricted net position in the amount of $82.6 million.
Changes in Net Position – Primary Government – The City’s total net position increased by $2.8 million from fiscal year
2013, which includes a $15.0 million decrease from changes in accounting principles.

A-8 • City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

Net Position
As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government’s financial position. The City’s
net position totaled $603.1 million at the end of 2014, compared to $600.3 million at the end of the previous year.
The components of net position comprise the following: the investment in capital assets such as land, buildings,
equipment, and infrastructure (road, bridges, and other immovable assets), less any related debt used to acquire those
assets that are still outstanding – this amount is $457.8 million indicating that the net book value of the City’s capital
assets exceeds the amount of related capital debt outstanding. The City uses these capital assets to provide services to
citizens; consequentially, these assets are not available for future spending. Although the City’s investment in its capital
assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided
from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.
A portion of the City’s governmental activities net position, $62.7 million or 10.4%, represents restricted net position, or
resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used. Internally imposed designations of
resources are not presented as restricted net assets. Unrestricted net position increased $8.5 million from 2013.

Governmental Activities
The City’s governmental activities net position increased by $2.8 million over the prior fiscal year. The following net
changes occurred during the course of operations in fiscal year 2014: In the assets accounts, cash and investments
increased by $80.0 million, receivables decreased by $62.6 million, and capital assets increased by $118.0 million. In the
liability accounts, there was a decrease in warrants and accounts payable of $4.3 million and an increase in accrued
liabilities of $28.9 million. Additionally, an increase of $16.6 million was recorded relative to the City’s other
postemployment benefit obligation in 2014.
During fiscal year 2014, the City’s revenues increased by 3.5%. The City’s largest sources of revenues were property
taxes, excise taxes, and payment in lieu of taxes of $2.06 billion (67.0% of total revenues) and $798.7 million of program
revenues (25.9% of total revenues). Taxes increased by $86.1 million from the previous year. Program revenues
increased by $5.9 million for fiscal year 2014. This is largely due to increases in parking meter revenues and increases in
operating grant reimbursements. The City’s expenses cover a range of services. The largest expenses were for schools
($1.55 billion), public safety ($821.2 million), general government ($162.0 million), public works ($157.5 million),
property and development ($118.8 million), public health programs ($69.9 million), and human services ($49.3 million).
In 2014, governmental activities expenses exceeded program revenues (i.e., user charges, operating grants, and capital
grants) by $2.27 billion. This shortfall was covered primarily through taxes ($2.06 billion) and unrestricted grants and
contributions ($199.0 million).
Comparative data on these revenues and expenses is itemized in the reporting of the Changes in Net Position – Primary
Government earlier in this Management Discussion and Analysis.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE CITY’S FUND STATEMENTS
This analysis is based on the Governmental and Proprietary Fund Financial Statements. As noted earlier, the City uses
fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance related legal requirements.
Fund Highlights
Governmental Funds – Fund Balances – as of the close of fiscal year 2014, the City’s governmental funds reported a
combined ending fund balance of $1.14 billion, an increase of $87.3 million from the prior year. Of this total amount,
$532.9 million represents the unassigned fund balance. The increase in fund balance is largely due to an increase in
property and excise taxes and a $59.5 million change in beginning fund balance related to the elimination of Section 108
receivables from deferred revenue from the implementation of GASB 65. Please refer to note 2n to the Financial
Statements.
Governmental Funds
The focus of the City’s governmental funds is to provide information on near term inflows, outflows, and balances of
spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the City’s financial requirements. In particular, unassigned
fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government’s financial position at the end of the fiscal year.
General Fund – Fund Balance – The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the City. The City’s General Fund – Fund
Balance Policy states in part to maintain a GAAP unassigned fund balance in the General Fund that is 15%, or higher, of
GAAP General Fund operating expenditures for the fiscal year. The GAAP unassigned fund balance at the end of fiscal
year 2014 was $532.9 million, which represents approximately 19.4% of GAAP General Fund operating expenditures.

Management’s Discussion & Analysis • A-13

However, because the City is required to follow the statutory basis of accounting rather than GAAP for determining the
amount of unassigned fund balance that can be appropriated, it is the statutory (not the GAAP) fund balance that is used
to calculate “free cash.” Free cash is the amount of statutory fund balance in the General Fund, as certified by the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ Department of Revenue, which is available for appropriation and is generated when
actual revenues, on a cash basis, exceed budgeted amounts and encumbrances are less than appropriations, or both.
The City has established the General Fund-Fund Balance Policy to ensure that the City maintains adequate levels of fund
balance to mitigate current and future risks (i.e., revenue shortfalls and unanticipated expenditures). The policy in full
states that the City shall maintain a GAAP Unassigned Fund Balance in the General Fund that is 15% or higher than the
current fiscal year’s GAAP General Fund Operating Expenditures. The City shall only consider the certification of Free
Cash (as defined by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ Department of Revenue) in years where the appropriation of
Free Cash shall not cause the fiscal year’s GAAP Unassigned Fund Balance to go below 15% of the fiscal year’s GAAP
General Fund Operating Expenditures, while maintaining a Budgetary Unassigned Fund Balance at 10% or higher of
Budgetary Operating Expenditures. The City shall only consider the appropriation of Certified Free Cash to offset: (1)
certain fixed costs such as pension contributions and related post-retirement health benefits; and/or (2) to fund
extraordinary and non-recurring events as determined and certified by the City Auditor.
Special Revenue Fund – Fund Balance – The Special Revenue Fund accounts for the proceeds of specific revenue
sources that are restricted or committed to expenditures for predefined purposes. The fiscal year 2014 Special Revenue
Fund balance is reported at $214.7 million, a $81.8 million increase from fiscal year 2013. This increase is due to an
increase in intergovernmental revenues from reimbursable grants as well as a $59.5 million change in beginning fund
balance related to the elimination of Section 108 receivables from deferred revenue from the implementation of GASB
65.
Capital Projects Fund – Fund Balance – The Capital Projects Fund accounts for financial resources to be used for the
acquisition or construction of major capital facilities, other than those financed by proprietary funds and trust funds. The
fiscal year 2014 Capital Projects Fund balance is $68.4 million, a $27.2 million decrease from fiscal year 2013.
Other Governmental Funds – Fund Balance – Other Governmental Funds account for assets held by the City in
permanent trust funds, as well as the activities related to DSRC and FBDC. The fiscal year 2014 Other Governmental
Funds fund balance is $76.3 million, a $132 thousand decrease from fiscal year 2013.
Internal Service Fund
The City’s Internal Service Fund accounts for the City’s self-insurance program for health benefits provided by Blue Cross
Blue Shield and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care for City employees, their dependents, and retirees. The Internal Service
Fund is included as part of the governmental activities in the government-wide statements.
Budgetary Highlights
General Fund budgetary highlights include ending fiscal year 2014 with a $9.5 million surplus. This represents the City’s
29th consecutive year with a balanced budget. There were no material variances between the original budget and final
budget amounts. Significant unfavorable variances from the final budget to actual results were in the areas of judgments
and claims, public safety, public works, and snow removal. Public safety saw an unfavorable variance of $20.7 million
due to an increase in overtime expenditures in the Police Department. Also, public works saw an unfavorable variance of
$4.3 million in snow removal.

A-14 • City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

Favorable results were reported for General Fund revenue sources, including $18.7 million in licenses and permits, $16.9
million in departmental and other revenue, $13.2 million in Commonwealth of Massachusetts funds and $38.0 million in
excises, predominantly in motor vehicle and room occupancy excise taxes. Other available funds shows a revenue deficit
of $57.3 million, however, this is a result of not transferring $16.5 million of parking meter receipts from the special
revenue fund, $807 thousand of cemetery funds and $40.0 million of free cash from the general fund.

CAPITAL ASSETS AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS
Capital Assets
The City’s investment in capital assets for its governmental activities, as of June 30, 2014, has a net book value of
$1.75 billion, made up of costs totaling $3.40 billion less accumulated depreciation of $1.65 billion. This investment in
capital assets includes land, buildings, improvements, equipment, infrastructure, and construction in progress.
Infrastructure assets are items that are normally immovable and have value only to the City, such as roads, bridges,
streets, sidewalks, drainage systems, lighting systems, and similar items.
The total increase in the City’s investment in capital assets for the current fiscal year was approximately $118.0 million in
terms of net book value. However, actual expenditures to purchase or construct capital assets were $219.4 million for
the fiscal year. Most of this amount was used for the purpose of constructing or reconstructing buildings and building
improvements. Depreciation charges for the year totaled $101.5 million. Additional information on the City’s capital
assets can be found in note 8 to the Financial Statements.
Long Term Obligations
Debt Administration – The authority of the City to incur debt is governed by federal and state laws that restrict the
amounts and purposes for which a municipality can incur debt. At year end, the City had $1.19 billion in General
Obligations Bonds principal outstanding – an increase of $49.3 million over last year.
There was one bond issuance that took place in fiscal year 2014. The March 12, 2014 $153.0 million Series A general
obligation bond issuance, used to finance various capital projects in the City. In March 2014, in conjunction with the
City’s annual bond offering, the rating service bureau Moody’s Investors Service reaffirmed the City’s bond ratings at
Aaa and the rating service bureau Standard & Poor’s increase the bond rating to a AAA. General Obligation Bonds are
backed by the full faith and credit of the City, including the City’s power to levy additional taxes to ensure repayment of
the debt. Accordingly, all general obligation debt currently outstanding has been approved by a vote of the City Council.
Notes and Leases Payable and Other Long Term Obligations – The City’s general long term notes and leases and other
long term obligations increased $34.9 million, or 3.09%, during the current fiscal year. Key factors for this increase are
the increase in the net OPEB obligation of $16.6 million and an increase in the workers’ compensation liability of $13.6
million.
Additional information on the City’s long term debt obligations can be found in note 10 to the Financial Statements.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The GASB has issued Statement No. 65, "Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities." This Statement specifies
items that were previously reported as assets and liabilities that should now be reported as deferred outflows of
resources, deferred inflows of resources, outflows of resources, or inflows of resources. The requirements of this

Management’s Discussion & Analysis • A-15

Statement were implemented effective July 1, 2013 for financial statements resulting in a restatement of beginning
equity for the governmental activities and special revenue fund and the reclassification of certain items reported within
liabilities as deferred inflows of resources and deferred outflows of resources. Refer to note 2n to the Financial
Statements for more information.

FUTURE PRONOUNCEMENTS
The GASB has issued Statement No. 67, "Financial Reporting for Pension Plans; an amendment of GASB Statement No.
25." This Statement replaces the requirements of Statements No. 25 and No. 50 related to pension plans that are
administered through trusts or equivalent arrangements. The requirements of Statements No. 25 and No. 50 remain
applicable to pension plans that are not administered through trust or equivalent arrangements. The requirements of
this Statement are effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2013.
The GASB has issued Statement No. 68, "Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions; an amendment of GASB
Statement No. 27." This Statement replaces the requirements of Statements No. 27 and No. 50 for employers’ provision
of pension benefits related to pension plans that are administered through trusts or equivalent arrangements. The
requirements of Statements No. 27 and No. 50 remain applicable for pensions that are not administered as trusts or
equivalent arrangements. The requirements of this Statement are effective for financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2014.
The GASB has issued Statement No. 71, “Pension Transition for Contributions Made Subsequent to the Measurement
Date – An Amendment of GASB Statement No. 68.” The objective of this Statement is to address an issue regarding
application of the transition provisions of Statement No. 68, “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions”. The
issue relates to amounts associated with contributions, if any, made by a state or local government employer or nonemployer contributing entity to a defined benefit pension plan after the measurement date of the government’s
beginning net pension liability. The provisions of this Statement should be applied simultaneously with the provisions of
Statement 68.

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of activities are different because:
Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. In the statement
of activities, the cost of those assets is depreciated over their estimated useful
lives. Capital outlays ($219,438) and gain on disposals ($109)
exceeded depreciation expense ($101,544)...................................................................................................

Issuances of long-term debt ($175,244) and notes ($3,200) increase long-term liabilities in the
statement of net position, but are included in the operating statement of the
governmental funds. Repayment of bond, note, and lease principal ($123,499)
are expenditures in the governmental funds, but reduce long-term liabilities in the statement
of net position. This is the amount by which issuances exceed repayments and
escrow payments..........................................................................................................................................
Bond premiums net ($7,577) increase the long-term liabilities in the statement of

(54,945)

net position, but are included in the operating statement of the governmental
funds. Deferred loss on refunding, net ($1,635) increase deferred outflows, net

Certain intergovernmental revenues decrease receivables on the statement of net position,
but are included in the operating statement of governmental funds..............................................................

(8,571)

Some expenses reported in the statement of activities do not require the use of
current financial resources and therefore are not reported as expenditures in the
governmental funds. This amount represents the increase in liabilities for
compensated absences ($9,086), other postemployment benefits ($16,610)
workers compensation ($13,613), and interest payable ($7,854) offset by a decrease in liabilities
for landfill closure and post closure costs ($167) and judgments and claims ($20,042)....................................

A-30 • City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2014
1. The Financial Reporting Entity
a. Primary Government
The City of Boston (the City), incorporated as a town in 1630 and as a city in 1822, now exists under
Chapter 486 of the Act of 1909 and Chapter 452 of the Acts of 1948 of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts (the Commonwealth), which, as amended, constitute the City’s Charter. The Mayor is
elected to a four-year term and serves as chief executive officer of the City. The Mayor has general
supervision of and control over the City’s boards, commissions, officers, and departments. The
legislative body of the City is the City Council, which consists of 13 elected members serving two-year
terms.
The accompanying basic financial statements present the City and its component units. The component
units discussed below are included in the City’s reporting entity because of the significance of their
operational or financial relationships with the City.
b. Blended Component Units Disclosure
i. The State-Boston Retirement System (SBRS) is a defined benefit contributory retirement system
created under state statute. It is administered by a Retirement Board comprising five members: the
City Auditor, who serves ex officio; two individuals elected by participants in the system; a fourth
member appointed by the Mayor; and a fifth member chosen by the other members. The SBRS
provides pension benefits to retired City, Boston Redevelopment Authority, Boston Housing
Authority, Boston Water and Sewer Commission, and the Boston Public Health Commission
employees. Although legally separate, the SBRS provides services entirely, or almost entirely, to the
City and thus has been reported as a blended component unit among the City’s fiduciary funds. The
financial statements of SBRS are included for its fiscal year end which is December 31, 2013.
ii. Dudley Square Realty Corporation (DSRC) and Ferdinand Building Development Corporation
(FBDC) – The DSRC is a Qualified Active Low-Income Community Business, and is the owner and
developer of the Dudley Municipal Center property. FBDC is the leverage lender of the Dudley
Municipal Center property. Upon completion of the Dudley Municipal Center, FBDC will lease the
property from DSRC and the City will sublease the property from FBDC. The DSRC and FBDC are
non-profit organizations qualified as tax-exempt entities under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code. Both entities are instrumentalities of the City, as the Mayor has full control of
appointments to their boards of directors. Although legally separate, both DSRC and FBDC provide
services entirely, or almost entirely, to the City and thus have been reported as blended
component units. These funds are presented as non-major funds within the other governmental
funds as of their fiscal year end, which is June 30, 2014.

Notes to the Basic Financial Statements • A-31

c. Discretely Presented Component Units Disclosure
These component units are reported in a separate column to emphasize that they are legally separate
from the City but are included because the City is financially accountable for the organizations, meaning
it appoints, at a minimum, a voting majority of the board of directors of the organization and is able to
impose its will on the organizations or has a financial benefit or burden relationship with the
organizations. Unless otherwise indicated, the Notes to the Financial Statements pertain only to the
primary government because certain disclosures of the component units are not significant relative to
the total component units and to the primary government. A description of the component units,
criteria for inclusion, and their relationship with the City are as follows:
i. Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) – The BRA is a public body politic and corporate
constituting the City’s redevelopment authority and exercising the powers of a planning board for
the City. The BRA is governed by a five-member board, four of whom are appointed by the Mayor.
Its purpose is to provide planning support for major construction and redevelopment activity in the
City.
ii. Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston (EDIC) – The EDIC is a body politic
and corporate and an instrumentality of the Commonwealth. It is governed by the same persons
appointed as members of the BRA board. The EDIC has various powers to assist industrial
development projects in the City and, together with the BRA, assists the City with its economic
development function.
iii. Boston Public Health Commission (PHC) – The PHC is a body politic and corporate and public
instrumentality of the Commonwealth, established by Chapter 147 of the Acts of 1995. PHC is
governed by a seven-member board, six of whom are appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by
the City Council, and one of whom is the chief executive officer of the Boston Medical Center
(BMC). The PHC is responsible for the implementation of public health programs in the City.
iv. Trustees of the Public Library of the City of Boston (TPL) – The TPL is a nonprofit organization
qualified as a tax-exempt entity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Trustees of
TPL are appointed by the Mayor. The TPL was established to benefit the public library system of the
City.
The financial statements of the discretely presented component units are included for their respective
fiscal year ends, which is June 30, 2014.
Complete financial statements of these discretely presented component units can be obtained through
the City Auditor’s office, Room M-4, City Hall Plaza, Boston, Massachusetts 02201. In addition,
condensed financial statements for the discretely presented component units are included in note 20.
d. Related Organizations
The Mayor is also responsible for appointing members of the governing bodies of the Boston Housing
Authority, Boston Industrial Development Finance Authority, and Boston Water and Sewer Commission;
however, the City’s accountability for these organizations does not extend beyond making these
appointments.

A-32 • City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies of the City conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as applicable to
governmental units as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The following is
a summary of the more significant policies followed by the City:
a. Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements
The Government-wide Financial Statements (i.e., the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of
Activities) report information on all of the nonfiduciary activities of the primary government and its
component units. For the most part, the effect of interfund activity has been removed from these
statements. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes and intergovernmental
revenues, are reported separately from any business-type activities, which rely to a significant extent on
fees and charges for support. The City currently reports no business-type activities. Likewise, the
primary government is reported separately from certain legally separate component units for which the
primary government is financially accountable.
The Statement of Activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function or
segment is offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a
specific function or segment. Program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants who
purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function or
segment and 2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital
requirements of a particular function or segment. Taxes and other items not properly included among
program revenues are reported instead as general revenues.
Separate financial statements are provided for Governmental Funds, Proprietary Funds, and Fiduciary
Funds, even though the latter are excluded from the Government-wide Financial Statements. Major
individual Governmental Funds are reported as separate columns in the Fund Financial Statements.
b. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation
i. Government-wide Financial Statements
The Government-wide Financial Statements are reported using the economic resources
measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the Proprietary Fund and Fiduciary
Fund Financial Statements. The Agency Fund within the Fiduciary Fund Financial Statements has no
measurement of results. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a
liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as
revenues in the year for which they are levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue
as soon as all eligibility requirements for recognition have been met.
ii. Governmental Fund Financial Statements
Governmental Fund Financial Statements are reported using the current financial resources
measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon
as they are “susceptible to accrual” (i.e., both measurable and available). Revenues not considered
to be available are recorded as deferred inflows of resources.

Notes to the Basic Financial Statements • A-33

The City applies the susceptible to accrual criteria to property and other taxes and
intergovernmental revenues. In applying the susceptible to accrual concept to intergovernmental
revenues, there are essentially two types of revenues. In one, resources must be expended on the
specific purpose or project before any amounts will be reimbursed to the City; therefore, revenues
are recognized based upon the amount of expenditures incurred subject to availability
requirements. In the other, resources are virtually unrestricted and are usually revocable by the
grantor only for failure to comply with prescribed compliance requirements. These resources are
reflected as revenues at the time of receipt or earlier if the susceptible to accrual criteria are met.
Property and other taxes are recognized as revenue in the year for which taxes have been levied or
earned, provided they are collected within 60 days after year-end. Generally, intergovernmental
revenues are recognized as revenue provided they are earned during the year and collected within
one year after year-end, except for Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) and Chapter
90 receivables which are considered available when received.
Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred. However, debt service
expenditures, as well as expenditures related to long-term liabilities including compensated
absences, other postemployment benefits, workers’ compensation and judgments and claims, are
recorded only when payment is mature and due.
iii. Proprietary Fund Financial Statements
Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from nonoperating items.
Operating revenues and expenses generally result from the provision of services. The principal
operating revenues of the City’s Internal Service Funds are receipts from employer and employees
for health insurance premiums. Operating expenses for the Internal Service Fund include
administrative expenses, vendor payments, and health benefits. Any revenues and expenses not
meeting this definition are reported as nonoperating revenues and expenses.
iv. Description of Major Funds
Governmental funds – The City reports the following major governmental funds:
1. The General Fund is the City’s primary operating fund. It accounts for all financial resources
of the general government, except those required to be accounted for in another fund.
2. The Special Revenue Fund accounts principally for the activities funded by federal and state
grant revenue sources and certain other revenues that are legally restricted to expenditures
for specified purposes.
3. The Capital Projects Fund accounts for bond proceeds and grant revenues used for the
acquisition or construction of the City’s capital facilities.
Proprietary fund –The City reports the following proprietary fund:
4. The City uses an internal service fund to account for its self-insured health costs. Although
the fund is presented in a separate column in the accompanying proprietary fund financial
statements, it is not considered a major fund.
Fiduciary Funds – The City reports the following fiduciary fund types:
5. The Private-Purpose Trust Funds are used to account for resources legally held in trust for
the benefit of individuals, private organizations, or other governments. The City operates
four pools used for the improvement of the City’s parks and cemeteries, educational
scholarships and sporting equipment, creation of public utility and beauty, and co-mingled
nontestamentary trusts.

A-34 • City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

6. The Pension Trust Fund accounts principally for the activities of the State-Boston Retirement
System, a blended component unit, which accumulates resources for pension benefit
payments to retired employees of the City and other entities.
7. The OPEB Trust Fund is an irrevocable trust fund established for other postemployment
benefits. The assets are appropriated from the General Fund and accumulate to reduce the
unfunded actuarial liability for health care and other postemployment benefits. The assets
of the trust are currently not used for direct payments of benefits.
8. The Agency Funds are used to report funds held by the City in a purely custodial capacity.
The City currently operates a drug evidence account for proceeds of property seized from
illegal drug-related activities. These funds are then used to offset the costs of technical
equipment or expertise and investigations.

c. Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, investments with original maturities of three months or
less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.
d. Basis of Investment Valuation
Investments are presented in the accompanying basic financial statements at fair value. Where
applicable, fair values are based on quotations from national securities exchanges, except for certain
investments of SBRS, which are described in notes 5 and 11. Further, income from investments is
recognized in the same fund as the related investments.
The City invests in the Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust (MMDT), which is an external
investment pool and is not SEC-registered. The fund is state-regulated and is valued at current share
price.
e. Interfund Receivables and Payables
Activity between funds that are representative of lending/borrowing arrangements outstanding at the
end of the fiscal year are referred to as either “due to/from other funds” (i.e., the current portion of
interfund loans) or “advances to/from other funds” (i.e., the noncurrent portion of interfund loans). All
other outstanding balances between funds are reported as “due to/from other funds.”
f.

Uncollectible Tax and Other Receivables
All receivables are shown net of an allowance for uncollectibles. Amounts considered to be uncollectible
are based on the type and age of the related receivable.

g. Capital Assets
Capital assets include property, plant, equipment, and infrastructure assets (e.g., roads, bridges,
sidewalks, and similar items), and intangible assets such as easements, land use rights, computer
software, trademarks and patents. Capital assets are reported in the governmental activities column in
the Government-wide Financial Statements. Capital assets are defined by the City as assets with an
initial, individual cost of more than $25,000 and an estimated useful life in excess of one year. Such
assets are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical cost if purchased or constructed. Donated
capital assets are recorded at estimated fair market value at the date of donation. Any significant
construction commitments are encumbered at year-end in the City’s Capital Projects Fund.

Notes to the Basic Financial Statements • A-35

The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially
extend assets’ useful lives are not capitalized.
Capital assets of the primary government are depreciated using the straight-line method over the
following estimated useful lives:
Assets
Years
Buildings
Building improvements
Infrastructure
Land improvements – major
Land improvements – playgrounds
Computer upgrades
Equipment and machinery

h. Compensated Absences
Employees are granted sick and vacation leave in varying amounts. Upon retirement, termination, or
death, certain employees are compensated for unused sick and vacation leave (subject to certain
limitations) at their then current rates of pay. The portion of the liability related to unused sick and
vacation time that has matured or is due as of June 30, 2014 is recorded in the Governmental Fund
Financial Statements. The entire amount of the liability is reported in governmental activities in the
Government-wide Financial Statements. The liability for vacation leave is based on the amount earned
but not used; for sick leave, it is based on the amount accumulated at the balance sheet date that would
be paid upon termination (vesting method). The liability for both amounts is calculated based on the pay
or salary rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
i.

Long-Term Obligations and Related Costs
Long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the governmental activities
Statement of Net Position. Bond premiums and discounts are capitalized and amortized over the life of
the bonds using the straight line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The
unamortized portion is presented in the Government-wide Statement of Net Position as a component of
bonds payable. Bond issuance costs are reported as expenses when incurred.
The Governmental Fund Financial Statements recognize bond premiums and discounts, as well as bond
issuance costs, during the period incurred. The face amount of debt issued is reported as other financing
sources. Premiums received on debt issuances are reported as other financing sources while discounts
on debt issuances are reported as other financing uses. Issuance costs, whether or not withheld from
the actual debt proceeds received, are reported as debt service expenditures.

j.

Net Position and Fund Balance
In the Government-wide and Proprietary Fund Financial Statements, net position is reported in the
following categories:
Net investment in capital assets: Capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, and outstanding
principal balances of debt attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those
assets.

A-36 • City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

Restricted: Net position the use of which is subject to constraints imposed by external parties,
including creditors, grantors, and laws and regulations of other governments, or imposed by City
Charter or enabling legislation. Nonexpendable amounts are required to remain intact under such
constraints.
Unrestricted: Remaining net position not considered net investment in capital assets or restricted.
For purposes of net position classification, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are available
for use, it is the City’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are
needed.
In the Governmental Fund Financial Statements, fund balance is reported in the following categories:
Nonspendable: Amounts that cannot be spent because they are either not in spendable form or
they are legally or contractually required to remain intact.
Restricted: Amounts the use of which is subject to constraints imposed by external parties, including
creditors, grantors, and laws and regulations of other governments, or imposed by City Charter or
enabling legislation.
Committed: Amounts that can only be used for specific purposes pursuant to constraints imposed
by formal action of the government’s highest level of decision-making authority. For the City, this
formal action takes the form of statutes which are passed by the City Council and approved by the
Mayor.
Assigned: Amounts that are constrained by the City’s intent for use for specific purposes, but are
considered neither restricted or committed. Under M.G.L. Chapter 190, Acts of 1982, the City
Auditor has the authority to assign amounts to be used for specific purposes on behalf of the City.
Unassigned: Amounts in the general fund that are not otherwise constrained for a specific purpose
more narrow than the general operations of the City. The City maintains a formal policy that
unassigned fund balance in the General Fund be at least 15 percent of the current year’s General
Fund GAAP basis operating expenditures.
For purposes of fund balance classification, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are
available for use, it is the City’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as
they are needed. When unrestricted resources are used, committed resources are used first, followed
by assigned and unassigned resources, respectively.
k. Tax Abatement Refunds
Matured tax abatement refunds that are due and payable at June 30 have been recorded as a liability in
the General Fund. A liability for estimated future tax abatement refunds have been recorded in the
Government-wide Statement of Net Position.

Notes to the Basic Financial Statements • A-37

l.

Landfill Closure and Postclosure Care Costs
State and federal regulations require the City to place a final cover on its Gardner Street landfill site
when it stops accepting waste and to perform certain maintenance and monitoring functions at the site
for 30 years after closure. At June 30, 2014, 100% of the Gardner Street landfill site had been used and
has not accepted solid waste for several years. While most of the landfill closure construction was
completed in prior years, there still remains 12 acres of the landfill to be capped as of June 30, 2014.
The total current cost of landfill closure and postclosure care is an estimate, subject to changes resulting
from inflation, deflation, technology, or other changes in applicable laws or regulations. Such costs are
recognized as expenditures in the General Fund to the extent that they are due or matured and are
expected to be paid with expendable available financial resources. The total liability is reported in the
Government-wide Statement of Net Position. Expenditures related to the Gardner Street landfill site
postclosure care in fiscal year 2014 were $167 thousand.

m. Use of Estimates
The preparation of the accompanying basic financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
n.

n. Restatements
Implementation of GASB Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities
Effective July 1, 2013, the City adopted GASB Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and
Liabilities. This statement requires reclassification, as deferred outflows of resources or deferred inflows
of resources, of certain items that were previously reported as assets and liabilities and recognition, as
current period outflows of resources or inflows of resources, of certain items that were previously
reported as assets or liabilities. The City has restated net position of the governmental activities at July
1, 2013 to reflect the retrospective recognition of bond issuance costs as outflows of resources that
were previously reported as other assets and restated beginning fund balance of the Special Revenue
Fund at July 1, 2013 to reflect the elimination of loans receivable from deferred revenue.
Change in Accounting Principle
In fiscal 2014, as part of the June 30, 2013 actuarial valuation, the City changed the manner in which the
projected unit credit actuarial cost method was applied to estimate the other postemployment benefit
(OPEB) liability. Under the current application, the City accrues OPEB benefits earned over the estimated
working life of the employee. Previously, the benefits earned were accrued through the date of initial
benefit eligibility. Such change was made to achieve greater comparability with other municipalities
within the Commonwealth. The change in methodology was retroactively applied to past actuarial
valuations to re-estimate the net OPEB obligation of the City and PHC, a participating employer in the
OPEB plan, at June 30, 2013. The net positions of the governmental activities and PHC (aggregate
discretely presented component units) at July 1, 2013 have been restated to reflect this change.
The following represents the effect of the restatements described above (in thousands):

3. Short-Term Debt
During fiscal year 2014, the City had no short-term debt issued or outstanding.
4. Budgetary Data
The General Fund is the only fund for which a budget is legally adopted. The budgets for all departments
included in the General Fund of the City, except the School Department, are prepared under the direction of
the Mayor and City Council. The School Department budget is prepared under the direction of the School
Committee.
Original and supplemental appropriations are submitted by the Mayor, approved by the City Council, and
lapse at year-end unless encumbered. The legal level of control over appropriations is at the department
level. Amendments to the original budget must be approved by the City Council, except for a reallocation of
appropriations of up to $3.0 million, which the Mayor may approve. Further, the City Auditor, with the
approval of the Mayor, may make transfers from any appropriation to any other appropriation for purposes
of eliminating deficits before closing the books for the fiscal year. After the close of the fiscal year, the City
Auditor may, with the approval of the Mayor, apply any income, taxes, and funds not disposed of and make
transfers from any appropriation to any other appropriation for the purpose of closing the accounts for the
fiscal year.
The City must establish its property tax rate each year so that the resulting property tax levy will comply
with the limits required by Proposition 2-1/2 (note 6). The tax levy must equal the sum of (a) the aggregate
of all annual appropriations for expenditures; plus (b) the reserve accounts described in the following
paragraph; plus (c) provision for the prior fiscal years’ deficits, if any; less (d) the aggregate of all
nonproperty tax revenues projected to be received by the City, including available funds, in amounts
certified or approved by the Commonwealth for tax rate purposes.
In accordance with the 1986 amendments to the Funding Loan Act of 1982, the City has established two
reserve funds. The first is a budget reserve fund, which is required to be funded in stages to a final level of
2-1/2% of the prior year’s overall departmental appropriations, except the School Department, by the
beginning of fiscal year 1990. It is available to be applied to extraordinary and unforeseen expenditures. The
second is a separate reserve fund of 1% to 2-1/2% of the current year appropriation of the School
Department to be applied to over expenditures in that department.

Notes to the Basic Financial Statements • A-39

The City’s General Fund budget is prepared on a basis other than accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (GAAP). The “actual” results column in the Statement of Revenues and
Expenditures – Budgetary Basis – General Fund is presented on a “budgetary basis” to provide a meaningful
comparison of actual results with the budget. The major differences between the budget and GAAP basis,
where applicable, are that:
i. Revenues are recorded when cash is received, except for real estate and personal property taxes,
which are recorded as revenue when levied (budget), as opposed to when susceptible to accrual
(GAAP).
ii. Encumbrances and continuing appropriations are recorded as the equivalent of expenditures
(budget) but have no effect on GAAP expenditures.
iii. Certain activities and transactions are presented in separate funds (GAAP), rather than as
components of the General Fund (budget).
iv. Amounts raised for the prior years’ deficits and available funds from prior years’ surpluses are
recorded as revenue items (budget), but have no effect on GAAP revenues.
In addition, there are certain differences in classifications between revenues, expenditures, and transfers.
The following reconciliation summarizes the differences between budgetary and GAAP basis accounting
principles for the year ended June 30, 2014 (in thousands):

5. Deposits and Investments
State and local statutes place certain limitations on the nature of deposits and investments available to the
City. Deposits, including demand deposits, money markets, and certificates of deposit in any one financial
institution, may not exceed 60% of the capital and surplus of such institution unless collateralized by the
financial institution involved. Investments from operating cash in the general fund may be made in
unconditionally guaranteed U.S. government obligations having maturities of a year or less from the date of
purchase, or through repurchase agreements with maturities of no greater than 90 days in which the
underlying securities consist of such obligations. Other allowable investments include authorized bonds of
all states, bankers’ acceptances, commercial paper rated within the three highest classifications established
by rating agencies, and units in the MMDT. The highest commercial paper classifications for Moody’s and
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) are as follows:
Commercial Paper Credit Ratings
Moody's
S&P
Superior
P1
A1+ or A1
Satisfactory
P2
A2
Adequate
P3
A3

The Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts oversees the financial management of the MMDT, a
local investment pool for cities, towns, and other state and local agencies within the Commonwealth. The
City’s fair value of its investment in the MMDT represents the value of the pool’s shares.
Primary Government (except the pension trust fund)
a. Custodial Credit Risk
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of bank failure, the City’s deposits or investments may
not be returned. The City carries deposits that are fully insured by FDIC insurance or collateralized in the
City’s name. As of June 30, 2014, there are no uncollateralized or uninsured cash accounts. All of the
City’s investments are held by third parties in the City’s name.
b. Investment Policy
The City’s primary concern in connection with its investment activities is a concern shared by all
municipal governments: the preservation of capital. The City’s investment policy establishes a discipline
in which all of the City’s investment activities may be safely conducted while it strives to use its capital
resources as efficiently as possible. The foundation of that discipline is fixed by Massachusetts General
Laws (M.G.L.) c. 44, sec. 55, which prohibits Massachusetts communities from investing in certain
categories of high-risk investments; limits the amount of the City’s bank deposits in any one financial
institution; and establishes qualifying criteria for banking institutions. Further, all investments held by
third parties are to be held in the City’s name.

Notes to the Basic Financial Statements • A-41

c. Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an
investment. It is the City of Boston Trust Funds’ policy to limit the average duration of an actively
managed fixed income portfolio to no more than seven years. The following is a listing of the City’s fixed
income investments (in thousands) and related maturity schedule (in years) as of June 30, 2014:

c. 44, sec. 55 contains several restrictions limiting where and under what circumstances the City may
deposit its funds. No investments in a single issuer exceeded 5% of the City’s investment portfolio.
f.

Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of an
investment or a deposit. As of June 30, 2014 the City of Boston Trust Funds held international equity
mutual funds valued at $46.6 million. Although this investment is not denominated in a foreign
currency, the underlying securities are denominated in various foreign currencies.

State-Boston Retirement System (SBRS or the System)
a. Custodial Credit Risk
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of bank failure, the System’s deposits may not be
returned. The System carries deposits that are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) insurance or collateralized with securities held by the System or the System’s agent
in the System’s name. As of December 31, 2013, all of the System’s deposits were insured or
collateralized.

A-42 • City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

b. Investment Policy
The provisions of M.G.L. C. 32, Sec 23(2) govern the System’s investment practice. Diversification is
attained through varied investment management styles that comply with Massachusetts state law. This
is accomplished through the retention of investment managers that adhere to M.G.L. C. 32, Sec. 3(3),
the “Prudent Person” rule.
The System has retained an investment consultant to work with the Retirement Board in a fiduciary
capacity to assure that strategic investment diversification is attained, to employ investment managers
with expertise in their respective asset classes, and to closely monitor the implementation and
performance of the respective investment strategies.
The System is currently invested in stocks (domestic and foreign), fixed income securities (domestic and
foreign), real estate, private equity, PRIT and hedge funds.

The System’s guidelines do not specifically address limits on maturities as a means of managing its
exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. The manager of each fixed income
portfolio is responsible for determining the maturity and commensurate returns of their portfolio.
The collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) held by the System as of December 31, 2013 are highly
sensitive to changes in interest rates.
d. Credit Risk
The System allows investment managers to apply discretion under the “Prudent Person” rule.
Investments are made, as a prudent person would be expected to act with discretion and intelligence, to
seek reasonable income, preserve capital, and, in general, avoid speculative investments.

U.S. government.
e. Concentration Risk
The System has no investments, at fair value, except for pooled funds, that exceed 5% of the System’s
total investments as of December 31, 2013.
The System adheres to the provisions of M.G.L. c. 32, sec. 23(2) when managing concentration risk.
f.

Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of an
investment or a deposit. Similar to the investments in domestic equities, the System employs or
encourages its investment advisor to employ diversification, asset allocation, and quality strategies.
Risk of loss arises from changes in currency exchange rates. The System’s exposure to foreign currency
risk is presented on the following table (in thousands).

g. PRIT Pooled Fund
The Commonwealth enacted Chapter 112, Section 17 of the Acts of 2010 that requires the System to
invest all assets, current and future, related to Boston Teachers in the Pension Reserves Investment
Trust (PRIT) fund. The PRIT fund is an external investment pool that is not registered with the Securities
Exchange Commission.
The fair value of the PRIT fund is based on unit value as reported by management of the PRIT fund. The
PRIT fund issues separately available audited financial statements with a year end of June 30.
As of December 31, 2013, the System had $1.4 billion invested in the PRIT pooled fund.
h. Derivatives
The System trades financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of its investing
activities to assist in managing exposure to market risks. The System uses forward foreign currency
contracts to hedge against the risk of future foreign currency fluctuations.

Notes to the Basic Financial Statements • A-45

6. Property Taxes
Real and personal property taxes are based on values assessed as of each January 1. By law, all taxable
property must be assessed at 100% of fair cash value. Also by law, property taxes must be levied at least
30 days prior to their due date. Once levied, these taxes are recorded as receivables, net of estimated
uncollectible balances. Property tax revenues have been recorded using the accrual and modified accrual
basis of accounting as described in note 2.
The City bills and collects its property taxes on a quarterly basis following the January 1 assessment. The due
dates for those quarterly tax billings are August 1, November 1, February 1, and May 1. Property taxes that
remain unpaid after the respective due dates are subject to penalties and interest charges.
Based on the City’s experience, most property taxes are collected during the year in which they are
assessed. Liening of properties on which taxes remain unpaid occurs annually. On December 10, 2013, all
properties with unpaid fiscal year 2013 property taxes were liened. The City ultimately has the right to
foreclose on all properties where the taxes remain unpaid.
A statewide property tax limitation known as “Proposition 2-1/2” limits the amount of increase in the
property tax levy in any fiscal year. Generally, Proposition 2-1/2 limits the total levy to an amount not
greater than 2-1/2% of the total assessed value of all taxable property within the City. Secondly, the tax levy
cannot increase by more than 2-1/2% of the prior year’s levy plus the taxes on property newly added to the
tax rolls. Certain provisions of Proposition 2-1/2 can be overridden by a citywide referendum.

a. Long-Term Receivable
The City participates in the Commonwealth’s school building assistance program, which is administered
by the MSBA. The MSBA provides financial assistance (up to 80% of total costs) to the City to build and/or
renovate schools. As of June 30, 2014, under this program, the City was due funds totaling $36.5 million.

b. Notes Receivable
Section 108 is the loan guarantee provision of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
program. Section 108 provides communities with a source of financing for economic development,
housing rehabilitation, public facilities, and large-scale physical development projects. Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) provides grants or loans to local governments, which in turn provides loans to
developers. As of June 30, 2014, under this program, the City determined that $60.0 million was
collectible. This amount is recorded in the City’s Special Revenue fund.

On March 12, 2014, the City issued $153.0 million of general obligation bonds, including $119.1 million
for various municipal capital projects and $33.9 million for the Dudley Municipal Center. Interest on the
bonds are payable semiannually each March 1 and September 1 until maturity in fiscal year 2034.
The City has entered into various capital lease agreements for equipment acquisition. Payments under
these agreements are subject to annual appropriation and, by statute, are not included in the City’s debt

Notes to the Basic Financial Statements • A-51

limit calculations. The gross amount of assets acquired under the equipment lease agreements totals
$45.9 million as of June 30, 2014. The City’s operating lease with DSRC is described in note 19.
No Obligation Debt
The City has outstanding industrial, commercial, and housing development bonds payable solely from
revenues of the respective enterprises that do not constitute an indebtedness of the City and are not
charged against its general credit. This aggregate amount is immaterial to the financial statements.
Defeased Debt
The principal amount of debt refunded through in-substance defeasance transactions for governmental
activities and still outstanding at June 30, 2014 was approximately $180.7 million.
Debt Capacity
The City is subject to a dual general debt limit: the normal debt limit and the double debt limit. Such
limits are equal to 5% and 10%, respectively, of the valuation of taxable property in the City as last
equalized by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. Debt may be authorized up to the normal debt
limit without state approval. Authorizations under the double debt limit, however, require the approval
of the Commonwealth’s Secretary of Administration and Finance. Additionally, there are many
categories of general obligation debt, which are exempt from the debt limit but are subject to other
limitations.
As of June 30, 2014, the City may issue $3.6 billion of additional general obligation debt under the debt
limit. General obligation debt of $551.0 million, subject to the debt limit, and $80.7 million, exempt from
the debt limit, are authorized but unissued as of June 30, 2014.
11. Retirement Plans
a. Plan Description
The City contributes to the SBRS, a cost sharing multiple employer defined benefit pension plan. The
System provides retirement, disability, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries of the
following government units:
(1) City of Boston
(2) Boston Redevelopment Authority
(3) Boston Housing Authority
(4) Boston Water and Sewer Commission
(5) Boston Public Health Commission
(6) Sheriff of Suffolk County (Retirees as of December 31, 2009, funded by the City)
Chapter 32 of the M.G.L. assigns authority to establish and amend benefit provisions of the plan to the
state legislature.
The System is administered by a five person Board of Retirement consisting of the City Auditor, who
serves as a member ex officio, two members who are elected by the participants, in or retired from the
service of the System, a fourth member appointed by the Mayor, and a fifth member chosen by the
other members. A complete set of financial statements for SBRS for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2013 can be obtained through the SBRS, Boston City Hall, Room 816, Boston, MA 02201.

A-52 • City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

Participation in the System is mandatory for all permanent, full time employees immediately upon the
commencement of employment. Participants who resign from employment and who are not eligible to
receive a retirement allowance or who are under the age of 55 are entitled to request a refund of their
accumulated total deductions. In addition, depending on the number of years of creditable service, such
participants are entitled to receive either none, 50%, or 100% of the regular interest which has accrued
on those deductions.
Employees with 10 or more years of service are entitled to pension benefits beginning at retirement age
55; an earlier retirement is allowed upon completion of 20 years of service. The System provides for
retirement allowance benefits up to a maximum of 80% of a participant’s highest consecutive three year
average annual rate of regular compensation. Benefit payments are based upon a participant’s age,
length of creditable service, level of compensation, and group classification. Participants become vested
after 10 years of creditable service. Effective July 1, 1998, Chapter 32 of the M.G.L. assigns to the local
retirement boards authority to establish and amend benefit provisions of the Plan and grant cost of
living increases.
If a member in service dies, the surviving spouse and/or surviving dependent children may receive
benefits, either in a lump sum or in the form of an annuity based on the length of service, contributions,
age, and the cause of death. In the event there are no spouse and/or dependent children named, other
beneficiaries may be entitled to a lump sum distribution. Participants who become permanently and
totally disabled from further duty may be eligible to receive a disability retirement allowance. The
amount of benefits to be received in such cases is dependent upon several factors, including whether or
not the disability is work related, the participant’s age, years of creditable service, level of
compensation, veteran status, and group classification.
b. Basis of Accounting
The System’s financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Plan member
contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are due. Employer contributions to
the plan are recognized when due and the employer has made a formal commitment to provide the
contributions. Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms
of the plan.
Investments are reported at fair value. Fair values of securities held directly are based on quotations
from national securities exchanges, except for pooled funds, alternative investments, and real estate, for
which fair values are estimated as detailed below:
(1) Pooled funds – the fair value of shares in managed investment pools is based on unit values reported
by the funds.
(2) Alternative investments are carried at the limited partnership interest or redemption value, the
equivalent of net asset value, which approximates fair value.
(3) Real estate investments consist of interests in commercial properties held by various partnerships
and other limited liability entities, some of which utilize debt financing. Fair values of such holdings are
reported based on the net asset values of the entities, which are estimated using third-party appraisals
and other information provided by property managers.

d. Contributions
Plan members are required to contribute to the System. Depending on their employment date, active
members must contribute a range of 5% – 11% of their regular gross compensation. Non-teacher
members hired after January 1, 1979 must contribute an additional 2% of regular compensation in
excess of $30,000. Participating employers are required to pay into the System their share of the
remaining System-wide actuarially determined contribution, which is apportioned among the employers
based on active covered payroll. The contributions of plan members and the participating employers are
governed by Chapter 32 of the M.G.L. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the System was due
$288.5 million from all employers and the Commonwealth and received $288.5 million in these
contributions. For the years ended June 30, 2012, 2013 and 2014, exclusive of contributions related to
the City’s teachers, the City’s required and actual contributions were $123.6 million, $137.0 million and
$153.0 million, respectively.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is statutorily required to fund the employer contributions
required for the City’s teachers. For the years ended June 30, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the
Commonwealth’s required and actual contributions were $90.4 million, $94.8 million and $99.5 million,
respectively. The 2014 amount is reported as intergovernmental revenue and retirement cost
expenditures in the General Fund.

f.

Securities Lending
The Public Employment Retirement Administration Commission of Massachusetts (PERAC) has issued
supplemental regulations that permit the System to engage in securities lending transactions. These
transactions are conducted by the System’s custodian, which lends certain securities owned by the
System to other broker dealers and banks pursuant to a form of loan agreement. The System and the
borrowers maintain the right to terminate all securities lending transactions on demand.
At the System’s direction, the custodian lends the System’s securities and receives cash (including both
U.S. and foreign currency), U.S. government securities, sovereign debt of foreign countries, and
irrevocable bank letters of credit as collateral. The custodian does not have the ability to pledge or sell
collateral unless the borrower defaults. Borrowers are required to deliver cash collateral in amounts
equal to not less than 100% of the market value of the loaned securities.
The System does not impose any restrictions on the amount of securities lent on its behalf by the
custodian. There were no failures by any borrowers to return loaned securities or pay distributions
thereon and there were no losses from a default of the borrowers or the custodian for the year ended
December 31, 2013. The cash collateral received by the custodian on each loan was invested, together
with the cash collateral of other qualified tax-exempt plan lenders, in a collective investment pool. The
relationship between the average maturities of the investment pool and loans was affected by the
maturities of the loans made by other plans that invested cash collateral in the collective investment
pool, which the System could not determine. At December 31, 2013, the System had no credit risk
exposure to borrowers because the amounts the System owed the borrowers exceeded the amounts
owed to the System.
At December 31, 2013, the fair value of securities loaned by the System amounted to $197.3 million,
against which was held collateral of $202.7 million as follows (in thousands):

funding to private equity funds, and $53.7 million to real estate funds.

In the January 1, 2013 actuarial valuation, the individual entry age normal actuarial cost method was
used. The actuarial assumptions included an 7.75% investment rate of return (8.25% for Boston
teachers) projected salary increases of 5.0% (variable rate for Boston Teachers), and cost-of-living
adjustments of 3.0% up to $13,000 annually. The actuarial value of assets was determined using the fair
value of investments. The System’s unfunded actuarial accrued liability is being amortized as a level
percentage of pay on an open basis. The remaining amortization period at January 1, 2013 was 13 years
(28 years for Boston Teachers).
The schedule of funding progress, presented as Required Supplementary Information (RSI) following the
notes to the financial statements, presents multiyear trend information about whether the actuarial
value of plan assets are increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued liability for
benefits. Actuarial calculations reflect a long-term perspective and are based on the benefits provided
under the Commonwealth Statues in effect at the time of each valuation and also consider the pattern
of the sharing of costs between the employee and members at that point in time. The projection of
benefits for financial reporting purposes does not explicitly incorporate the potential effects of legal or
contractual funding limitations or the pattern of cost sharing between the employee and members in
the future.
12. Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB)
GASB Statement No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits
Other Than Pensions, requires governments to account for OPEB, primarily healthcare, on an accrual basis.
The effect is the recognition of an actuarially required contribution as an expense on the Government-wide
Statement of Activities when a future retiree earns their postemployment benefit. To the extent that an
entity does not fund their actuarially required contribution, a postemployment benefit liability is recognized
on the Government-wide Statement of Net Position over time. OPEB benefits are reported as expenditures
on a pay-as-you-go basis in the governmental funds.
In addition to the pension benefits described in note 11, the City provides postemployment healthcare and
life insurance benefits, in accordance with state statute and City ordinance, to participating retirees and
their beneficiaries. Participating retirees are City retirees. As of June 30, 2013, the most recent actuarial
valuation date, approximately 14,700 retirees and 14,400 active members meet the eligibility requirements
as put forth in Chapter 32B of M.G.L. The City sponsors and participates in an agent multi-employer defined
benefit OPEB plan. The Boston Public Health Commission, a discretely presented component unit, also

A-56 • City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

participates and contributes to the plan. The OPEB plan is administered by the City and does not issue a
stand-alone financial report.
Medical and prescription drug benefits are provided to all eligible retirees not enrolled in Medicare through
a variety of plans offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, and
Neighborhood Health Plan. Medical and prescription drug benefits are provided to retirees enrolled in
Medicare through supplemental and Medicare Advantage plans offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, and Tufts Health Plan.
Groups 1 and 2 retirees, including teachers, with at least 10 years or 20 years of creditable service are
eligible at age 55 or any age, respectively. Group 4 retirees with at least 10 years or 20 years of creditable
service are eligible at age 45 or any age, respectively. Retirees on accidental disability retirement are eligible
at any age, while ordinary disability requires 10 years of creditable service. The surviving spouse is eligible to
receive pre and postretirement death benefits, as well as medical and prescription drug coverage.
a. Funding Policy
Employer and employee contribution rates are governed by the respective collective bargaining
agreements. The OPEB Plan is currently funded on a pay-as-you-go basis plus periodic advance funding
contributions as amounts are available. The employers and plan members share the cost of benefits. As
of June 30, 2013, the valuation date, the plan members contribute 10% to 26.25% of the monthly
premium cost, depending on the plan in which they are enrolled. The City contributes the balance of the
premium cost.
b. Basis of Accounting
The OPEB Trust Fund is prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Employer contributions to the
plan are recognized when made. Benefits are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the
terms of each plan.
Investments are reported at fair value. Fair value of securities held directly are based on quotations from
national securities exchanges.

Notes to the Basic Financial Statements • A-57

c. Annual OPEB Cost and Net OPEB Obligation
The City’s annual OPEB expense is calculated based on the annual required contribution of the employer
(ARC), an amount actuarially determined in accordance with the parameters of GASB Statement No. 45.
The ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is projected to cover the normal
cost each year and amortize any unfunded actuarial liability over a period of 30 years. The following
table shows the components of the City’s annual OPEB cost for the year ended June 30, 2014, the
amount actually contributed to the plan, and the change in the City’s net OPEB obligation based on an
actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2013 (in thousands):

Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and
assumptions about the probability of occurrence of events far into the future. Examples include

A-58 • City of Boston Basic Financial Statements

assumptions about future employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts determined
regarding the funded status of the plan and the annual required contributions of the City are subject to
continual revision as actual results are compared with past expectations and new estimates are made
about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as required supplementary information
following the Notes to Financial Statements, presents multiyear trend information that shows whether
the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued
liabilities for benefits.
e. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions
Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the substantive plan (the plan as
understood by the City and plan members) and include the types of benefits provided at the time of
each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing of benefit costs between the City and plan members
to that point. The actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are designed to
reduce short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent
with the long-term perspective of the calculations.
The most recent actuarial valuation was performed as of June 30, 2013. The projected unit credit cost
method was used. The actuarial assumptions included a 7.50% investment rate of return, an inflation
rate of 4.5% and an annual healthcare cost trend rate of 7.5% initially, reduced by decrements to an
ultimate rate of 5.0% after 5 – 6 years. The actuarial value of assets was determined using the fair value
of investments. The healthcare cost trend rate differs between the master medical and other healthcare
plans. The City’s UAAL is being amortized as a level percentage of pay on an open basis. The remaining
amortization period at July 1, 2013 was 30 years.

16. Commitments and Contingencies
The City has committed $97.1 million in encumbrances for purchase orders, contracts, and judgments and
claims in the General Fund, $27.8 million in the Special Revenue Fund, $137.4 million in the Capital Projects
Fund, and $309 thousand in Other Governmental Funds.
17. Public Health System
Effective July 1, 1996, the City’s Department of Health and Hospitals and Trustees of Health and Hospitals
were abolished. Substantially all their assets and liabilities, including title to the City’s two hospitals, BCH
and Boston Specialty and Rehabilitation Hospital (BSRH), were transferred to and assumed by PHC.
Also effective July 1, 1996, the operations of BCH and BSRH were consolidated with the operations of the
Boston University Medical Center under the licensure and control of the BMC.

Notes to the Basic Financial Statements • A-61

The PHC receives the majority of its funding from federal and state grants, and a City appropriation. During
fiscal year 2014, the City appropriated $66.8 million to the PHC. As described below, the PHC uses the
appropriation to pay debt service on certain general obligation bonds, for administrative purposes and to
support the various public health programs run by the PHC. The City has budgeted $67.6 million for the PHC
for fiscal year 2015.
Due from PHC/BMC
General obligation bonds issued by the City between December 1967 and October 1995 for which PHC is
responsible for repayment total $0.8 million as of June 30, 2014. These bonds pertain to the property and
operations of the BCH Campus, South Block Campus, BSRH Campus, Emergency Medical Services
Operations, and the Long Island Campus.
In addition, the PHC is also responsible for reimbursing the City for health insurance, equipment lease
payments, workers’ compensation, and other miscellaneous expenses paid for by the City.
18. Risk Management
The Risk Management Program focuses on a planned strategy of self-insurance, supported by strong
prevention and cost reduction efforts, financial reserves and catastrophic insurance. The City is self-insured
in most areas of risk including general liability, property and casualty, workers’ compensation, certain
employee health care costs and unemployment compensation.
The City’s legal liabilities are capped per M.G.L. Chapter 258, and Corporation Counsel defends the City in
any lawsuits that arise from the normal course of operations. For workers’ compensation, the City is exempt
from state insurance requirements per M.G.L. Chapter 152 Section 25B. The City’s Workers’ Compensation
Division, as well as the Police and Fire Departments, manage employee injury claims internally. The City
budgets for and funds legal claims and employee injury costs through the General Fund, charging specific
departments for their share of costs in order to promote awareness and prevention efforts.
The City provides health insurance coverage for employees and retirees through a variety of insured and
self-insured plans. The City budgets for and funds the premium costs for all plans through the General Fund.
Self-insured plans are financially managed through the Internal Service Fund established in compliance with
M.G.L. Chapter 32B, Section 3A. In fiscal year 2013, a guiding policy for the more prudent management of
the City of Boston Health Claims Trust Fund was established. This policy states that accounting for the fund
will be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and will ensure that all contributions
and actual costs are shared between employers and their subscribers according to predetermined ratios.
For unexpected large losses, the City maintains a catastrophic risk reserve, which has an available balance of
$26.1 million at the end of fiscal 2014. To further protect the City’s assets and finances from adverse loss,
commercial insurance is purchased strategically for certain exposures. A catastrophic property insurance
policy provides $100.0 million for all risk protection after a $10.0 million deductible. Boiler and machinery
losses are insured up to $25.0 million per incident, after a $50 thousand deductible.

The liabilities above have not been discounted to their present value. Incurred claims represent the total of
a provision for events of the current fiscal year and any change in the provision for events of the prior fiscal
years.
There are numerous pending matters and lawsuits in which the City is involved. The City attorneys’ estimate
that the potential claims against the City not recorded in the accompanying basic financial statements
resulting from such litigation would not materially affect the basic financial statements.
19. Dudley Square Realty Corporation (DSRC) and Ferdinand Building Development Corporation (FBDC)
As described in note 1, the DSRC is a Qualified Active Low-Income Community Business, and is the owner and
developer of the Dudley Municipal Center property. FBDC is the leverage lender of the Dudley Municipal
Center property. During the year ended June 30, 2014, the City granted DSRC $59.8 million. This is a grant for
funding the project and there is no obligation for any payments back to the City regarding this grant. As the
project sponsor during fiscal year 2013, the City authorized and issued $28.9 million in general obligation
bonds and transferred proceeds to FBDC. FBDC, utilizing these bond proceeds, made loans totaling $29.3
million to two investment funds. As of June 30, 2014 $29.3 million is due to FBDC on such loans. The
investment funds made these proceeds and funds from additional investments available to eight leverage
lenders that made loans in the aggregate amount of $40.8 million to DSRC to finance the Dudley Municipal
Center project. This amount is recorded in the City’s Notes and Leases Payable line of note 10. Upon
completion of the Dudley Municipal Center project, FBDC will be the master tenant and will lease the project
from DSRC.

SELECTED DEMOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION
The following report has been prepared by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (the “BRA”) for inclusion in
the Official Statement. The report describes the principal components of the economy of the City of Boston (the
“City” or “Boston”) and presents major economic, demographic and market indicators, and historical, statistical and
other information.
This report contains forecasts, projections and estimates that are based on expectations and assumptions which
existed at the time such forecasts, projections and estimates were prepared. In light of the important factors that may
materially affect economic conditions of the City, the inclusion in this report of such forecasts, projections and
estimates should not be regarded as a representation of the BRA or the City that such forecasts, projections and
estimates will occur.
The information contained herein has been furnished by the BRA and certain information has been obtained
from other sources which are believed to be reliable, but is not guaranteed as to accuracy or completeness, and is not
to be construed as a representation of the underwriters of the Bonds or, as to information from other sources, of the
BRA or the City.

THE BOSTON ECONOMY
Boston is the twenty-fourth largest city, in terms of population, in the United States and the economic hub
of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Commonwealth”). It is a center for professional, business, financial,
technology, research and development, higher educational and medical services, as well as for transportation,
communications, export, cultural and entertainment activities. Boston is the capital of the Commonwealth and is
host to several federal regional offices.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (“ACS”) Boston’s population for
2013 was 644,710. The Boston Redevelopment Authority Research Division estimates there are 698,875 payroll and
non-payroll jobs in Boston as of 2013 based on data provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (“BEA”) and
Massachusetts Department of Workforce Development (“DWD”). Boston’s jobs represent 16.2% of the total
statewide jobs.
Overview of Recent Economic Conditions
Boston’s economy, on average, outperformed both Massachusetts and the nation in terms of job growth
from 2004 through 2014. During that period Boston’s average annual job growth was 1.2%. Following the start of
the Great Recession in December 2007, the national economy began to experience rising unemployment and
deteriorating economic conditions. In late 2008 Boston’s economy began to show signs of a weakening labor
market, and economic conditions worsened from late 2008 until February 2010, when positive job growth returned.
Payroll jobs grew in Boston at an average annual rate of 1.4% from 2010 through 2014, exceeding the national
recovery. Boston’s unemployment rate for 2014 was 5.8%, which was almost half a percentage point less than the
national rate.
Similar to the job market, Boston’s office real estate market experienced a downward shift beginning in the
last half of 2008 through mid-2010. The housing market in Boston, also hurt by the recession’s rising foreclosures
and the tight lending market, saw reductions in sales volumes and small to moderate drops in prices. Boston’s
experience during the recession was milder than conditions experienced in many other large markets across the U.S.
Following the recession, Boston’s economic growth continued through 2014 with lower unemployment rates and
improvements to the real estate market. The 2014 monthly median house price in Boston exceeded $450,000.
Statistical Data
Statistical data relating to population, employment and income are derived primarily from four separate
sources: the U.S. Census Bureau; the Bureau of Economic Analysis (the “BEA”); the U.S. Department of Labor,
Bureau of Labor Statistics (the “Bureau of Labor Statistics”); and the City of Boston and the Boston Redevelopment
Authority (the “BRA”), each of which is described below.
The Census Bureau publishes information about population, housing and the economy. The most recent
decennial Census data is from the 2010 Census. In addition, some monthly, quarterly and annual data are available
through December 2014 on certain topics for the region, the Commonwealth, and Metropolitan Boston 1. The Census
Bureau also publishes the American Community Survey (“ACS”) which provides data through 2013 on a citywide
basis and by census tract.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis publishes quarterly and annual statistics on income and employment.
The most recent annual figures for the nation, Massachusetts and for Metropolitan Boston are for 2013. The City
accounts for approximately 85% of Suffolk County’s population and approximately 96% of its employment. The
Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes data and reports about the workforce and related subjects including
unemployment rates, area wages, and cost-of-living adjustments. The most recent monthly data are for November
2014.

Federal data sources have three prevailing definitions of the Boston Metropolitan Area. Each table with Metropolitan data explains whether
Metropolitan Boston refers to: the Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”), the New England City and Town Area (“NECTA”), or Combined
Statistical Area (“CSA”).

2

The City and the BRA prepare reports and compile data on the population and economy of the City and its
neighborhoods. The BRA also analyses and reports on local, regional, state and national trends obtained from public
and private sources on the following topics: employment, occupations, large employers, City schools, universities
and colleges, medical institutions, tourism and lodging, transportation, office and industrial markets, housing,
building activity, urban redevelopment, and infrastructure projects.
The statistical data contained in this report represent the latest published data available. While the City
believes that it has used the most recent available data in this report, the data contained herein may not reflect
current conditions or trends because of publication lags resulting from time required to collect, tabulate, and publish
the data. Moreover, statistical data are approximations and generalizations subject to various sources of error
inherent in the statistical process, and may be revised on the basis of additional data. The statistical data contained
herein describes past activity and are not presented in order to suggest the continuation of any trend, or to predict
future economic activity either in particular categories or in general.

The 2010 Census showed that Boston’s racial composition was: White, Non-Hispanic 47.0%; Black, NonHispanic 22.4%; Hispanic 17.5%; Asian/Pacific Islander 8.9%; Multi-racial 2.4%; other single race 1.6%; and
Native American 0.2%. Changes between 2000 and 2010 shows population growth for Hispanic (27%) and Asian
(28%) populations and flat to marginal decreases in white, non-Hispanic (-0.4%) and black, non-Hispanic (-1.6%)
populations. All other categories combined (American Indian, Alaskan, Hawaiian, Other single race and Multiracial), totaling 26,446 persons is 6.1% lower than in 2000.
According to the 2010 Census, Boston continues to be a city of young adults due to the large number of
students and young professionals living and working in the City. Thirty-five percent of all persons in Boston in 2010
were between 20 and 34 years old compared to 33% in 2000. Between 2000 and 2010, the largest growth of an age
group in Boston was individuals between 55 and 64, which saw a 26.7% increase. This is consistent with national
trends and the aging of the baby boomer population. Boston’s elderly population (aged 65 and over) grew slightly to
62,337 people but now represent a smaller share of the total population. Boston also saw a decline in children ages 5
to 14, which in 2010 represented 8.6% of the total population, as compared to 11.6% in 2000.
The 2013 ACS shows that the trend toward fewer families (related people living together) and to more nonfamily households (comprised of single persons and roommates) continued in Boston from 2010 to 2013. The total

3

number of households in Boston for 2013 was 251,757, with 48% of those being families, while the share of nonfamily households (mainly roommates and single people) was 52%. Group quarters population continued to increase
both for the institutionalized and non-institutionalized populations, the majority of which are the nursing home and
student dormitory population groups. Household size increased from 2.26 persons in 2010 to 2.38 persons in 2013
while average family size also showed a gain from 3.08 to 3.18 persons.
In 2013, Massachusetts had a population of approximately 6.7 million people and 4.3 million jobs,
according to BEA annual data. Massachusetts personal income grew at an average annual rate of 2.8% from 2008
through 2013, exceeding the national income growth over the same period by one-tenth of a percentage point.
Between 2012 and 2013 Massachusetts jobs grew by 2.3%.
Metropolitan Boston had 4.7 million people and 3.2 million jobs in 2013. Total personal income for the
MSA from 2008 through 2013 grew at an average annual rate of 2.9%, exceeding the national rate during that
period. From 2008 through 2013, Metropolitan Boston experienced an average annual growth in jobs of 0.6%.

Employment Structure, Employment Trends and Occupational Changes
The economy of Metropolitan Boston rests primarily on high technology, finance, professional and
business services, defense, and educational and medical institutions. The City’s economy is more specialized in the
financial, governmental, business and professional services, and educational and medical sectors than the suburban
economy, which is more specialized in high technology and the defense industry.
The table below shows Boston’s employment growth by industry category for 2010 through 2013. The
industry categories are in the North American Industrial Classification System (“NAICS”) format, which the Bureau
of Economic Analysis began using in 2001. Suffolk County data is mathematically reduced to the Boston geography
using unemployment insurance coverage data (Employment Security, ES-202, for cities and towns from the
Massachusetts Department of Workforce Development, “DWD”,).
Following the Great Recession, positive job growth returned in February 2010, however, it was not until
later in 2011 when total jobs returned to prerecession levels. Between 2010 and 2011, 17,806 total jobs were added,
an increase of 2.7%. This was followed by another 1.6% increase in 2012, or 10,922 new jobs. The top five
industries adding the most jobs between 2010 and 2013 in order are: professional, scientific and technical services;
health care and social assistance; accommodation and food services; construction; and education. Most of the other
major industries showed either reasonable gains or marginal losses.

Source: The employment figures are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis Series for Suffolk County, pro-rated to the City’s geographical
boundary using data from DWD. See the footnote above. Due to use of pro-rating factors, minor discrepancies of 1 to 3 units between
totals and employment categories may result.

Preliminary estimates for November 2014 indicate that Boston has added 24,574 jobs, since November
2013. This represents a 3.5% rate of annual job growth, which if sustained through the end of the year would
represent the highest year of job growth since 2007.
The following table indicates that, as of 2013, 68% of employed City residents were white-collar workers
and 32% were blue-collar and service workers, as compared to 1970 when the shares for the same categories were
55% and 45% respectively. Between 2000 and 2013, the proportion of white collar workers in the City actually
declined slightly while the blue-collar jobs share has risen primarily due to the growth in blue-collar services
occupations, such as food services and accommodation.

Analysis. Estimates reflect most recent available data.

In addition to private employers, the public sector has large numbers of employees in the City. According
to a preliminary estimate by the BRA, using a series consistent with the Bureau of Economic Analysis, there were an
estimated 76,145 federal, state and local government workers in the City in 2013. Certain large state government
offices, federal regional offices, U.S. Postal Service facilities, state-chartered authorities and commissions (such as
the Massachusetts Port Authority and the Boston Water and Sewer Commission), and the City’s local government
agencies and departments, are located within Boston.
Labor Force and Education
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the City’s resident labor force has been steadily increasing from 1980
through 2010. Since 1980, the increase in the number and age of the population have combined with the rising labor
force participation of women, minorities, youth and the elderly to produce a larger labor force overall. Census data
show that by 1990, the City’s population had increased by 2.0% compared to 1980, while the City’s employed
resident workforce increased by 10.6%. During the 1990s, Boston’s population continued to rise, posting a 2.6%
increase while the number of workers (aged 16+) grew by 3.2%. From 2000 through 2010 Boston’s population rose
by 3.1% and the employed resident workforce grew by 5.0%. Boston’s population grew by 4.4% to 644,710 from
2010 to 2013, of which the employed resident workforce consists of 348,181 people for 2013.

7

General improvement in the educational attainment of residents (aged 25 and over) continued throughout the
1980-2013 period. The percentage of this population that had completed four or more years of college more than
doubled during this period from 20.3% to 45.2%. Improving educational attainment levels and shifting occupational
patterns suggest a concurrent transformation of the City’s workforce as the City’s economy has moved to a service
and knowledge dominated employment base.
The City supports a wide-range of workforce development activities for adults and youth including the
following: adult basic education; English for Speakers of Other Languages; English for Employment; Adult
Diploma Program; GED (General Equivalency Degree – High School Diploma); Bridges to College preparation;
occupational skills training; transitional job experience; and support services such as counseling and case
management. In 2012, the Jobs and Community Services division (“JCS”) of the BRA, the City’s workforce
development agency, provided job training to more than 500 adults through multiple public funding sources and
employed over 5,000 youth in publicly-supported summer jobs. Additionally, nearly 5,000 adults received adult
literacy services through Boston’s Adult Literacy Initiative and English for New Bostonians. Linkage contributions
paid into the Neighborhood Jobs Trust provide supplemental sources of funding for job training and adult education
programs. For a full discussion of the City’s jobs linkage program as well as the housing linkage program see “The
Linkage Program,” later in this section.

Community Survey, 2013” one-year estimates.

Income, Wages, and Cost of Living
Per capita personal income for Suffolk County was $57,660 in 2013, 29% above the national per capita
personal income of $44,766, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. City residents constitute approximately
85% of the County’s population. An historical summary of per capita income shows that from 1980 through 2013
Suffolk County’s per capita income grew at a rate greater than that of the nation. The City’s median household
income (in current year dollars), based on Census data from the 2013 ACS, rose from $39,629 in 2000 to $53,601 in
2013. The figures in this paragraph and the chart on the next page reflect earned income of persons residing in the
named areas plus rents, interest and other unearned income and transfer payments from governmental entities. As
such, these figures take into account certain income sources not included in the survey of average annual wages in
the following paragraph, which reflects earned income of persons who work (but do not necessarily reside) in the
named areas.

Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis indicate that the average annual wage and salary disbursement
per job for 1980 through 2013 by place of work have been consistently higher over time in Suffolk County than in
Metropolitan Boston and the Commonwealth. In 2013, Suffolk County’s average wage per job ($79,697) was 21.5%
greater than that in the Boston metropolitan area ($65,599) and 32% greater than the state ($60,307).

Medical and Higher Educational Institutions
Boston’s medical and educational institutions are an important component of its economy, providing
employment opportunities for residents of the City and Metropolitan Boston. Expenditures by these institutions as
well as their employees, patients, students and visitors stimulate the City’s trade and service sectors.
There are twenty-one in-patient hospitals located within the City with a combined total of 6,161 beds in
2012. The largest of these are: Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, Tufts New England Medical Center, and Boston Medical
Center. The City is also the home of the medical, dental, and public health schools of Harvard, Tufts and Boston
University, and of 25 public neighborhood health clinics, as well as private health maintenance organizations and
membership clinics.
Three hospital projects were completed in 2013, adding a total of 229,800 square footage, with a total
investment of $257 million. These projects were St. Elizabeth’s Hospital Emergency Department addition, Boston
Children’s Hospital Main Building Expansion, and the Dana Faber Cancer Institute Garage infill project. In 2013
and 2014, five major projects were under construction for a total of 580,600 square feet. These projects were the
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Bowdoin Street Health Center, Brigham and Women Hospital (BWH) Green
Street Garage, BWH Mental Health Center, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) 125 Nashua Street, and
Longwood Center. This represents an approximate $659 million in new construction activity. Lastly, there is
another 1.4 million square feet of hospital and research development that was approved in 2013.
For 19 consecutive years Boston has received more National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding than any
other city in the nation. Boston’s total NIH awards received for fiscal year 2013 was $1.72 billion. In 2013, eight
organizations in Boston received over $100 million in NIH funding, representing 62.5% of all NIH funding for
hospitals in the nation. Massachusetts is home to five of the top Universities that anchor those hospitals: Harvard,
the University of Massachusetts, Boston University, MIT and Tufts University. Cambridge is the core life sciences
cluster but Boston is gaining in size and strength with growth in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area
(“LMAA”), the Innovation District in the South Boston Waterfront and other emerging areas such as the South End
Boston Medical Center-Albany Street area and the former Charlestown Navy Yard. The Massachusetts
Biotechnology Council (MassBio) states that the Massachusetts biopharma industry has grown by 42% in
employment over the past ten years.
In 2014, the Vertex Pharmaceuticals and the Longwood Center projects were completed, which are the first
and third largest lab facilities in Massachusetts. Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ 1.1 million square feet of space recently

10

opened. Nearly 1,300 employees are expected to work in the headquarters, and 500 more jobs are expected to be
added. Longwood Center is the $350 million project located in the heart of the LMAA. The Longwood Center
development added 350,000 square feet of R&D space in Boston’s strongest life sciences cluster. One-third of
Longwood Center has already been leased to Dana Farber and the developer is in active negotiations with other life
sciences lessees. In 2013, six new life sciences companies moved to Boston contributing approximately 50 jobs to
the Boston economy, and five companies expanded their presence in Boston adding 33 new jobs.
As of academic year 2013-2014, data from the City of Boston’s University Accountability Ordinance report
and the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, indicate that the City’s 35
universities, colleges, and community colleges had a combined enrollment of 145,471 full- and part-time students.
These numbers include some of the professional and graduate schools of Harvard and Tufts, whose principal
campuses are in Cambridge and Medford, respectively. Based on total graduate, undergraduate, and professional
school enrollment, Boston University was the largest university in Boston in the fall of 2013, with 32,411 students.
Boston, with nearly 10% of the state’s population, has about one third of the statewide college student enrollment.
From 2006 through 2013 major higher education academic projects and college housing were completed in
Boston, including projects for: Berklee College of Music, Boston College, Boston University, Emerson College,
Emmanuel College, Harvard University, the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, Massachusetts College of
Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Simmons College, Suffolk University, Wentworth Institute
of Technology, and Wheelock College.
As of January 2014, five college or university academic building projects were under construction and six
other projects had been approved by the BRA Board. The buildings now under construction include: the Boston
Conservatory academic and practice facility, the Boston University School of Law renovation and addition, Suffolk
University’s 20 Somerset Street academic building, Harvard University’s Chao Center executive education building;
Northeastern University’s Integrated Science and Engineering Building. Emerson College’s 1-3 Boylston Place
dormitory was approved, and will begin construction soon, while Emerson’s Little Building is under review. There
are five projects related to the University of Massachusetts system located in Boston, two projects at the
Massachusetts College of Art and Design (MCAD): gallery renovations and ad Design and Media Center, and two
projects at UMass-Boston: an Integrated Science Complex and a General Academic Building. Construction
continues on the Kennedy Institute for the U.S. Senate at Columbia Point, which is on the UMass-Boston campus,
though technically not part of the university.
College dormitory construction has also been undertaken. Between 2000 and 2013, 33 dormitories with
12,199 dormitory beds (11,233 undergraduate and 958 graduate) opened to house Boston’s college students.
Completed projects include: Northeastern University’s GrandMarc dormitory, Wentworth Institute of Technology’s
525 Huntington Avenue dormitory, and Boston College’s St. Thomas More Hall dormitory. Another dorm at the
New England Conservatory has been approved but has yet not begun construction. As college enrollment grows,
completion of new student residences is taking students out of neighborhood housing which will eventually reduce
market housing costs and ameliorate a currently tight housing vacancy rate.
Tourism and Culture
Boston ranks among the top ten destinations in North America for conventions, meetings, and trade shows,
based on the number and quality of the shows booked. Boston currently has three main convention sites—the John
B. Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center (“Hynes”), the Seaport World Trade Center, and the 2.1 million
square-foot Boston Convention & Exhibition Center (“BCEC”), the largest building in New England and capable of
hosting large national and international events. In 2014 the Hynes and the BCEC hosted a combined total of 241
events with an aggregate of 845,000 attendees. This resulted in approximately 630,000 hotel room nights and
generated an overall economic impact of approximately $590 million, according to the Massachusetts Convention
Center Authority (“MCCA”). For 2015, it is anticipated that the two convention centers will generate 615,000 room
nights, and will host nine events generating over 19,000 room nights each. In 2014, the MCCA received legislative
authorization for a 1.3 million square foot expansion of the BCEC.
Since 2007, several cultural facilities have opened, starting with the Boston Children’s Museum $47
million construction project adding 23,000 square feet of new facilities in addition to a 50,000 square-foot

11

renovation in April. The Emerson College renovation of the Paramount Theater opened in 2009. The Suffolk
University renovation of The Modern Theater was finished in 2010. In 2011, The Museum of Fine Arts completed
and opened its “Art of the Americas” wing, a 462,400 square-foot multi-phase expansion. In January 2012, the
Gardner Museum completed its $114 million expansion adding 70,000 square feet of new building space. The
19,000 square-foot Tea Party Shipyard Museum and the $28 million project, opened in July 2012.
On January 8, 2015, the United States Olympic Committee (“USOC”) announced that Boston was selected
as the United States applicant city for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. According to the USOC, the
International Olympic Committee deadline for the 2024 submission is September 15, 2015, with the host city to be
determined in 2017. The City began hosting public meetings for the 2024 Olympic bid in January 2015.
Hotel Market
Between 2000 and 2009, 25 hotels opened in the City, making up one-third of the current hotel stock.
Boston’s favorable hotel market and the decision to build the BCEC stimulated considerable new development over
this period. Two hotels opened in 2009: the 114-room Ames Hotel, an adaptive reuse of an historic office building
near Government Center, and the 235-room “W” Hotel in the Theater District. Two additional hotels completed
construction and opened in 2013. A 175 room Marriott Residence Inn was built in the Fenway/Kenmore district and
another 120 room Marriott Residence Inn was developed through the adaptive reuse of the Stillings Building in
South Boston, near the BCEC convention center. Currently, Boston has 73 hotels, with 70% rated as upper midscale
or above. As of December 2014, there were a total of 18,658 hotel rooms in establishments of fifty or more rooms in
Boston.
The average occupancy rate of hotels in Boston was 75.5% over the past 20 years, according to the latest
data from the Pinnacle Perspective Monthly Report. In the 1990s, this rate climbed steadily and remained around
79.0%, as shown in the table below. The occupancy rate in the 2000s did not exceed 77% throughout the decade due
to the 2001 recession and new hotel construction expanding Boston’s hotel capacity. In 2009, the occupancy rate
plummeted to 70.5% due to the Great Recession that stemmed from the financial crisis of 2008. However, the
occupancy rate soon recovered, growing at an average annual rate of 2.5% from 2009, and reached 81.6% in 2014,
the highest rate since 1990. Excluding the recession years, these statistics suggest that Boston is a robust hotel
market.
The City’s Average Daily Rate (“ADR”) represents the average rate paid per rooms sold over a given
period of time. The ADR is highly correlated with the occupancy rate, which follows the same trend but on a lagged
basis. The ADR from 1990 to 2013 grew 18.6% from $118.72 in 1990 to $238.55 in 2014. This growth is significant
as the hotel room inventory was smaller in 1990 than today. The table below shows the room supply, occupancy
rate, ADR, and revenue per available room for Boston for the years 1990, 2000, and 2005 through 2014. The rise in
ADR can be attributed to a number of sources including: the new hotels built after the 1990s added to the upper
scale inventory with higher daily rates and increased demand for hotel stays. The hotel industry provided 10,787
direct jobs in Boston for 2012, accounting for 1.9% of Boston’s total payroll jobs, and 32.4% of Massachusetts’
hotel industry employment.

Transportation
The City is a major national and international air terminus, a seaport, and the center of New England’s rail,
truck and bus service. The City is served by three limited-access interstate highways which connect it to the national
highway system: U.S. 90 (the “Massachusetts Turnpike”), which leads westward from downtown Boston 138 miles
to the New York State border; U.S. 95, the East Coast’s principal north-south highway, which connects Boston to
Portland, Maine to the north and New York City and Washington, D.C. to the south; and U.S. 93, another northsouth interstate highway, that extends from just south of the City north to New Hampshire. The City is also served
by the following freight railroad carriers: CSX, Conrail (a regional rail carrier), Boston and Maine (a subsidiary of
Guilford Transportation Industries); and Bay Colony (a local carrier).
Transportation planning includes both major highway and mass transit programs. The Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority (“MBTA”) provides commuter rail, subway, local bus and express bus services to 175
cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts, offering public transit to a population of almost 4.7 million people in an
area of 3,200 square miles. The MBTA, the fifth largest mass transit system in the nation as determined by ridership,
currently serves about 1.1 million passengers per day.
The MBTA Draft Capital Investment Program FY 2015-FY 2019 (CIP) includes $6.2 billion in capital
spending. The CIP consists of seven major programmatic areas: (i) infrastructure investment ($2.38 billion); (ii)
accessibility improvements ($222 million); (iii) system enhancement ($387 million); (iv) system expansion efforts
($24 million); (v) statewide transportation improvements ($77.4 million); (vi) state of good repair ($3.1 billion); and
(vii) stimulus projects ($44.6 million). The major infrastructure projects include: vehicles ($1.07 billion); station
modernization ($173.3 million); rail signaling systems ($140.3 million); track/right-of-way ($61.1 million); bridges
($440.3 million); technology, other ($28.5 million); power ($229.7 million); maintenance facilities, including rail
car houses and bus garages ($89.1 million); fare equipment ($18.3 million); administration facilities ($119.4
million); and communications ($6.7 million).
Boston’s South Station, one of three major high speed rail terminals on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor
(NEC), currently hosts high speed intercity passenger rail (HSIPR), including Amtrak Acela Express and Northeast
Regional services. It is also the terminus for Amtrak’s Lake Shore Limited service between Boston and Chicago.
The MBTA also operates commuter rail, subway, and guideway bus services at the station. The station’s Bus
Terminal is the hub for private intercity and regional motor coach carriers in eastern Massachusetts.
The State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) is a federally mandated prioritized listing of
highway, bridge, intermodal and transit projects expected to be undertaken during the next four federal fiscal years.
The document is a compilation of those state, regional and local transportation priorities funded by the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and must be financially-

13

constrained to the federal amounts allocated to Massachusetts. The project lists are updated annually and include
projects programmed by the state’s ten metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) and the three non-MPOs. There
are several Boston-based projects listed in the fiscal 2015 through FY2018 STIP including improvements along Blue
Hill Avenue, Gainsborough Street, St. Botolph Street, reconstruction of Melnea Cass Boulevard, repairs to the North
Washington Street Bridge, Commonwealth Avenue reconstruction (Amory Street to Alcorn Street), and utility
relocation for the Massachusetts Avenue Bridge. MBTA capital improvements within Boston for 2015 through 2018
include the following projects: the Fairmount Line Improvements; State Street and Orient Heights Station
accessibility improvements, reconstruction and accessibility changes to the Government Center Station; and new
vehicles for the Red and Orange subway lines.
Seaport and Airport
The Massachusetts Port Authority (“Massport”) was created by the state legislature to develop and manage
the City’s major air and sea transportation centers. Massport is financially independent, and the City is not
responsible for any debt or other obligations incurred by Massport. Heavy use of Boston Logan International Airport
(“Logan Airport”) and the Port of Boston have compelled significant expansion of both facilities. Massport’s net
investment in Boston facilities for ongoing and proposed projects, according to its fiscal year 2014 through 2018
Capital Program, is projected to be $932.2 million in airport projects and $140.8 million invested in maritime
development and other capital projects.
The Port of Boston serves the six-state New England region as a natural deep-water port supporting import
and export of containerized bulk and general cargo. The port also provides ship repair supply services, customs and
international freight forwarding services, intermodal cargo warehouse facilities, and other maritime support services.
Massport’s Conley Container Terminal provides containerized freight water access to other container terminals
across the world. The Port of Boston is also a major cruise port. The total number of cruise passengers in 2014
(316,851), a decrease of 17.2% compared to 2013. The cruise port mainly operates in the months of May through
November.
The Port of Boston ranked as the 12th largest container port on the U.S. Atlantic Coast by container
volume. The Port handled 214,243 boxed containers including imports, exports, and empties. The port also handled
60,048 automobiles in 2014, an increase of 15.5% from 2013. Additionally, the port handled 962,488 bulk metric
tons in 2013, which is a 2% increase from 2012’s bulk tonnage.
In 2014, Logan Airport served a total of 31.6 million domestic and international passengers, a 4.7%
increase from the 30.2 million passengers served in 2013. Logan Airport also plays an important role as a center for
processing domestic and international air cargo. In 2014, total combined cargo and mail volume was 265,560 metric
tons, an 8.8% decrease from the 244,120 metric tons handled in 2013.
Construction Activity
The following table sets forth construction activity in the City for fiscal years 2004 to 2014. It should be
noted that the issuance of a building permit and payment of a fee do not necessarily result in construction activity.
The estimated revenue from building permit fees during fiscal 2014 indicated that total construction activity is
projected to total $4.71 billion compared with an estimate of $3.49 billion for fiscal 2013. Between 2013 and 2014,
building permit revenue increased 37%, exceeding revenues for the past ten years.

Large Public Sector Projects
Boston has witnessed several other major public sector projects in recent years including the original BCEC
Project 2, the Central Artery/Tunnel (“CA/T”), the downtown highway tunnel through the City including the Ted
Williams tunnel under Boston Harbor, and the Callahan Tunnel Rehabilitation Project.
The Callahan Tunnel Rehabilitation Project was designed to totally rehabilitate the Callahan Tunnel which
connects the North End and Logan International Airport as well as Route 1A in East Boston. After fourteen months
of construction, only two and a half months of which the tunnel was closed, the tunnel reopened on March 10, 2014.
The CA/T Project included: the Ted Williams Tunnel, connecting Logan Airport and the North Shore to
Downtown Boston and the western suburbs, the Leverett Circle Connector Bridge, a four-lane bridge over the
Charles River carrying traffic between Leverett Circle in downtown Boston and U.S. 93 in Charlestown, the
extension of U.S. 90 under Fort Point Channel to South Boston connecting with the highway with the Ted Williams
Tunnel and Logan Airport in East Boston, and the Central Artery and the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge over
the Charles River. The CA/T Project, with an estimated total cost of $14.63 billion, was funded in part by the federal
government while the remainder was the responsibility of the Commonwealth.
In 2014, the MBTA was awarded a $20 million Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery
(“TIGER”) discretionary grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The project will bring major
improvements to Ruggles Station by construction a new platform to allow for more inbound commuter trains and
increasing accessibility. The total project cost is $30 million.
The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (“MWRA”), an independent state authority has also spent
over $7.8 billion on capital improvements, including the Boston Harbor Project, since its inception. The MWRA’s
FY2015 Capital Improvements Program enumerates five major initiatives that have been completed, the Boston
Harbor Program, the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel, the Carroll Water Treatment Plant, the Combined Sewer
Overflow Control Plan, and Covered Storage facilities. To date the MWRA has spent $6.0 billion on these five
initiatives, with the Boston Harbor project being the most expensive, costing $3.8 billion.

The City prepares a 5-7 year Capital Plan. These capital investments represent improvements to schools,
libraries, parks and recreation sites, roads and bridges, and other City properties. See “City Indebtedness—Capital
Planning and Borrowing Program” in the City’s Information Statement dated as of March 1, 2015.
Office Market and New Development
The City and its inner neighborhoods currently have approximately 63.1 million square feet of office space.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, Boston’s direct vacancy rate according to realty firm Colliers Meredith & Grew
was 10.9%. Boston had an annual absorption of 1.77 million square feet. However, in 2014 Jones Lang LaSalle,
another realty firm, reports a total net absorption for Boston of 655,080 square feet. The discrepancy between the
two figures can be attributed to a difference in collection methods. Colliers Meredith & Grew calculates absorption
based on the physical movements of tenants. Jones Lang LaSalle measures positive and negative absorption as soon
as a space is listed as available to the public (negative) or as soon as a lease is signed to fill the space (positive),
regardless of whether the tenant has physically left or entered the space at the time. Colliers Meredith & Grew use
the method most common in the industry.

As of January 2015, four major office space permits were issued totaling 1.3 million square feet. North
Andover, MA-based sneaker giant Converse will relocate their headquarters to 186,525 square feet of space in the
Hoffman Building, one of the structures on Boston’s Lovejoy Wharf. The Beal Companies is in the process of an
upgrade and is expanding the existing 11-story Hoffman Building located at 160 North Washington Street into a
241,000 square-foot office structure. Converse will occupy all but one floor in the Hoffman Building. The move to
downtown Boston followed an extensive search for a new company headquarters in the greater Boston metropolitan
area. The new office space will be developed as part of the revitalized Lovejoy Wharf project led by Related
Companies and The Beal Companies, and will also include a residential component in the next phase. The
investment supports Converse’s long-term business growth and commitment to Boston and the Commonwealth.
Skanska USA Commercial Development Inc. is investing $210 million in a 440,000 square foot office
building in the South Boston Waterfront's Innovation District that will be occupied primarily by
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). Construction on the 17-story office building in Seaport Square began in 2013 and
is anticipated to be ready for occupancy in late 2015. PwC, the professional services firm and one of downtown
Boston’s largest employers, signed a 15-year lease for 333,000 square feet in the building. The firm expects to move
about 3,000 employees to the custom-designed workplace. PwC currently has more than 2,500 partners and staff
working at 125 High Street in Boston.
The Burnham Building will contain approximately 100,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor
and first basement level, and at least one upper floor. Above the retail floors will be approximately 185,000 square
feet of office space. Construction is currently already underway with Arnold Worldwide and its sister agency Havas
Media signed as major tenants in the building.

The Boston Landing project proposes to redevelop underutilized property in Allston-Brighton along Guest
Street, adjacent to the existing New Balance Headquarters to create a new vibrant health and wellness district. The
project calls for a 1.43 million square foot development: 250,000 square foot new world headquarters building for
New Balance, a 350,000 square-foot sports complex, a 140,000 square foot boutique hotel, three office buildings
totaling 650,000 square feet, and 65,000 square feet of retail/restaurant uses. The project will add to the
transformation of the Brighton/Guest Street Planning Area in Brighton from a former light industrial area into a
mixed-use economic engine for the City.
Retail Market
For 2013, from the table in a previous section in this Appendix titled “Employment Structure, Employment
Trends and Occupational Changes”, it is estimated that there are about 89,651 employees in retail stores, and food
service and eating and drinking establishments in the City, with 32,186 in retail, and 57,465 in food service,
accommodation, and eating and drinking. In 2007, according to the Census of Retail Trade, about 2,157 retail
establishments were located in the City with estimated total sales of $6.81 billion. The food service and eating and
drinking establishment industry in Boston (restaurants and bars) consists of an additional 1,986 establishments with
$2.35 billion in sales. The retail sector is also complemented by an estimated 14,000 employees in the personal
services businesses, which includes such services as repair and maintenance, hair and nail care, and laundry and dry
cleaning service. The 2007 Census of Retail Trade data was released in January of 2010 and is only done once every
five years. The 2012 Census of Retail Trade data for the U.S. was released in 2014, however, state, county, and city
retail data is still unavailable from the 2012 Economic Census. Therefore more recent information for the following
table is not yet available.

There are now 20 neighborhood business districts operating within the City’s Main Streets Program. This
program is a public-private initiative of the City established in 1995 to revitalize neighborhood commercial districts
through locally established organizations. In fiscal year 2013, 103 new businesses opened in Main Streets districts,
creating 663 new jobs. Technical assistance was provided to 1,856 small businesses. 393 special district events
generated over 31,000 volunteer hours and the local Main Streets Programs has kept its storefront occupancy rates at
an average of 95%.
The retail market in 2014 was strong. According to CoStar, Boston’s vacancy rate for 2014 was 2.1%.
Retail rents were strong, particularly in the Downtown core and immediate surrounding areas. Quoted retail rental
rates were $24.83 per square foot for 2014. National and world retailers have taken note and are entering to serve
Boston’s growing urban population. Fashion outlet Nordstrom Rack and neighborhood retailer Walgreen’s have
opened with a combined 60,000 square foot retail space. High-end retailers are also making a larger footprint into
the Boston market with the addition of the 40,000 square foot Restoration Hardware and Chanel Inc.’s retail store
moving from a 3,000 square foot to a 10,000 square-foot building.
Also of importance are the supermarket developments that have taken place throughout Boston’s
neighborhoods. Twenty-four new or expanded supermarkets have opened in Boston’s neighborhoods since 1992. A

17

Whole Foods Market opened in the South End on the second week of January 2015. There are currently 42
supermarkets in Boston, with several more projects underway. New stores are planned for the North and South
Ends, as well as Jamaica Plain. The City has also announced plans to bring a Wegmans Food Market to Fenway, and
a Roche Brothers in Downtown Crossing is expected to open in 2015.
Industrial Market and Recent Developments
The Boston/Suffolk County sub-market has approximately 20.32 million square feet of industrial space and
6.18 million square feet of flex space according to CoStar. The vacancy rates at the end of 2014 were approximately
8.6% for industrial and 3.6% for flex. The average asking rent for industrial was $9.05 per square foot NNN (“NetNet-Net”, or net property tax, insurance, and maintenance), and $14.27 per square foot NNN for flex. Since 2013,
rental rates for industrial have increased 6.5% and flex increased by 9.8%.
The Boston Marine Industrial Park consists of over three million square feet of developed real estate.
Kavanagh Advisory Services has been awarded conditional development rights for the development of 360,000
square feet of research and development space on a four acre parcel. Kavanagh expects to secure financing and
tenant procurement in 2014. Construction should commence in 2015. Cargo Ventures is expected to begin
construction of a 120,000 square foot cold storage facility on the North Jetty in 2014 as well. Several acres of
maritime and industrial parcels are available with multiple suitors in conversation with EDIC.

Housing Stock, Housing Values, and Development
There were 272,481 housing units in Boston according to the 2010 Census. Of the 252,699 occupied units,
32.2% were owner-occupied and 67.8% were renter-occupied. Vacant housing units totaled 19,782 while the
homeowner unit vacancy rate was 2.2% and the rental unit vacancy rate was 5.2%. The 2013 ACS results showed
that the median monthly cost for home owners with a mortgage was $2,147 and the gross monthly rent (for existing
renters rather than advertised rents) was $1,263. Gross rents are what tenants pay out of their pocket and the
availability of public and subsidized housing makes this value much lower than advertised market rents for newly
available units.
Preliminary data for 2014 real estate trends was provided by the City’s Department of Neighborhood
Development, which shows that the median rent for an apartment in Boston in 2014 as advertised by the Multiple
Listing Service (MLS) was $2,400 per month for all apartment sizes and types. The citywide median advertised
rents in this sample did not change between 2013 and 2014, but there were some major changes in Fenway, Central
planning district (Downtown), and Roxbury. Median rents for an apartment in Boston’s neighborhoods ranged from
a high of $2,750 in the South End to a low of $1,475 in Hyde Park.

Condominium sales volume and prices also showed variability across the neighborhoods of Boston in 2013
and 2014. The three most expensive neighborhoods for condominiums were the Central neighborhood (comprising
Downtown, the North End, the West End, and the Waterfront), Back Bay/Beacon Hill, and the South End
neighborhood, which together form the core residential pockets closest to downtown. Four neighborhoods had
moderately expensive condominiums (median price between $401,000 and $525,000): Charlestown, South Boston,
Jamaica Plain and Fenway/Kenmore. The median citywide condominium price as of calendar year 2014 was
$470,500, a 7.2% price increase from calendar year 2013, while the sales volume decreased 19.1%.

When housing prices began to fall and sales volume slackened following 2005, foreclosure deeds rose
through 2008, peaking at 1,215, while petitions to foreclose (the first step in the foreclosure process) peaked at 2,432
in 2007. By 2014 foreclosure deeds increased to 99 from 94 in 2013, however, foreclosure deeds remained
significantly lower than the peak in 2007 and 2008. Petitions to foreclose rose by 56% from 2013 to 2014, a change
from 232 to 362.
Since 1999, 24,458 new units with a total value of $8.4 billion have been permitted in Boston, 85%
(20,488) of these housing units have been completed and occupied with 3,970 units now currently in construction.
Ten large housing developments (mainly private rental apartments but some with assisted units) now in construction
have over 2,700 (more than two-thirds) of these housing units being built as of February 2013: Pier 4, the
Kensington, the Victor, West Square, 120 Kingston Street, Waterside Place, Millennium Phase 3 at Hayward Place,
Avalon/Exeter Residences, and 319 A Street (Boston Wharf Tower). Since 1999, of the total housing units permitted
for construction (complete and under construction) 18,333 were in private-sector, market rate housing while 6,125
have been publicly-assisted through various federal, state or local funding sources.

The Boston Housing Authority (“BHA”) is a public agency that provides subsidized housing to low- and
moderate-income individuals and families. The BHA administers two distinct housing programs. First, the Authority
manages conventional public housing within the City of Boston. The Authority owns 60 developments, a few of
which have both state and federal components and has also participated in the mixed-finance redevelopment of
seven of its developments. The BHA owns and manages some scattered site properties throughout the City of
Boston as well. Of the 60 developments, 36 are designated as elderly/disabled developments and 24 are designated
as family developments. Two of the 24 family developments have elderly/disabled housing on site and one of the
elderly developments has designated units for families. The BHA currently owns and/or oversees approximately
14,000 units of public housing in Boston and houses about 27,000 people under this program. In addition, the BHA
administers approximately 14,500 tenant-based and project-based rental assistance vouchers, along with some
moderate rehabilitation programs that allow families and individuals to either rent in the private market and apply a
subsidy to their rent or to live in subsidized affordable housing in the city. Through this assistance, residents are able
to pay approximately 30-40 percent of their income toward rent and the BHA pays the remainder. The BHA helps
provide housing to approximately 33,000 people under these programs.
The BHA between 1997 and 2013 completed major revitalization initiatives at seven public housing
developments: Mission Main, in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston; Orchard Gardens, in Roxbury; West
Broadway in South Boston; Franklin Hill in Dorchester; Maverick Gardens in East Boston; Washington Beech in
Roslindale; and Old Colony in South Boston, which is currently in its second phase of redevelopment. The BHA
was able to undertake revitalization of five of these developments through the use of HOPE VI grants awarded from
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”). The grants, totaling $157 million, were used to
implement a new approach to public housing financing, incorporating innovative partnerships with public and
private entities that leveraged additional development funds. The initiatives not only revitalized the BHA sites, but
the surrounding neighborhoods as well. West Broadway, a State funded public housing development, was
redeveloped through the use of a public/private partnership that included State and City funding. In addition, the
BHA completed redevelopment of the Franklin Hill public housing development in 2009 through a fifth
public/private partnership and recently completed redevelopment of the Washington Beech housing development in
Roslindale under a partnership that includes HOPE VI and federal stimulus funding. Additional federal stimulus
funding recently awarded to the BHA, as well a subsequent HOPE VI grant, led to the redevelopment efforts at the
Old Colony development in South Boston. In addition, some building renovations at both the Cathedral development
in the South End and the Heath Street development in Jamaica Plain were recently completed as a result of Recovery
Act funding. BHA is also in the midst of implementing an energy performance contract project that will bring about
$63 million in energy efficient/infrastructure improvements to 13 BHA developments throughout the City.
The Linkage Program
The City implemented its development linkage program in 1983 in order to direct some of the benefits of
downtown investment to the building of affordable housing in its neighborhoods through the Neighborhood Housing
Trust (NHT). The linkage program also funds job training for City residents through the Neighborhood Jobs Trust
(NJT). Under the linkage program, which was amended in 1986, 2001, and again in 2013, real estate developers
seeking approval of large scale commercial or institutional developments are required to enter into agreements
obligating them to pay exactions in the amount of $10.01 per square-foot of construction over 100,000 square feet,
of which $1.67 per square-foot goes to the job training fund and $8.34 per square-foot goes for affordable housing
purposes. The fee was last adjusted as of October 17, 2013.
Linkage payments to the NHT are amortized over a period of either seven or twelve years, depending on
the date of the initial agreement. Under NHT policy, current agreements provide for a seven-year payment period.
The seven-member NHT board holds public hearings and has the authority to approve linkage grants and enter into
Housing Payment Agreements for selected projects or to recommend approval of Housing Creation Proposals by the
BRA. Since the inception of the linkage program through December 2014, the NHT has awarded approximately
$148 million in grant funds to 206 various affordable housing developments in the City of Boston. The NHT
funding contributed to the construction, pending construction, or renovation of 12,568 housing units of which
10,751 units are affordable. The NHT funding represents 5% of the combined development cost of all assisted
projects. NHT grant awards are allocated to fund low and moderate-income housing through the renovation of old
buildings and schools and the construction of new housing. Projects have included rental developments of familysized units, single room occupancy units, units set aside for homeless or formerly homeless households, elderly

24

housing units, and units exclusively for other special needs populations. In addition, the NHT grants support the
development of housing ownership opportunities in condominiums, housing cooperatives, and single-family homes.
Between fiscal years 1988 and 2014, over $29 million of funds were received into the NJT through the City’s
linkage program, and approximately $27 million of funds had been awarded to a broad range of community-based
job training and adult education programs. Services funded under this program include: model program designs for
entry-level job training, adult education, English for Speakers of Other Languages, and transitional employment.
The NJT is particularly interested in supporting innovative education and training activities which result in highwage employment, new or non-traditional employment opportunities, and community-based projects that respond to
specific neighborhoods’ documented education and training needs. The NJT is committed to providing appropriate
services to the residents of neighborhoods where, or adjacent to where, a given development project is located, while
also ensuring that residents throughout the City have access to new jobs resulting from development.

2015 Series A and 2015 Series B Bonds

APPENDIX B

________, 2015

David Sweeney, Chief Financial Officer
and Collector-Treasurer
City of Boston
Boston, Massachusetts

Re: City of Boston, Massachusetts
General Obligation Bonds, 2015 Series __
We have acted as Bond Counsel to the City of Boston, Massachusetts (the “City”), in connection
with the issuance by the City of $___________ General Obligation Bonds, 2015 Series __ (the
“Bonds”), dated the date hereof. In such capacity, we have examined the law and such certified
proceedings and other papers as we have deemed necessary to render this opinion.
As to questions of fact material to our opinion we have relied upon representations and
covenants of the City contained in the certified proceedings and other certifications of public
officials furnished to us, without undertaking to verify the same by independent investigation.
Based on this examination, we are of the opinion, under existing law, as follows:
(1)
The Bonds are valid and binding general obligations of the City and, except to the
extent they are paid from other sources, the principal of and interest on the Bonds are payable
from taxes which may be levied without limitation as to rate or amount upon all taxable property
in the City.
(2)
Interest on the Bonds is excluded from the gross income of the owners of the
Bonds for federal income tax purposes. In addition, interest on the Bonds is not a specific
preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes.
However, such interest is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate
alternative minimum taxable income. In rendering the opinions set forth in this paragraph, we
have assumed compliance by the City with all requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 that must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that interest thereon
be, and continue to be, excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The City
has covenanted to comply with all such requirements. Failure by the City to comply with certain
of such requirements may cause the interest on the Bonds to become included in gross income
for federal income tax purposes retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds. We express no
