The above-captioned Series 2008 Bonds (the “Series 2008 Bonds”) will be issuable as fully registered bonds without coupons and, when issued, will
be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). DTC will act as securities depository of the Series 2008
Bonds. Individual purchases of beneﬁcial interests may be made in book-entry form only, in the denominations of $5,000 and integral multiples thereof.
Purchasers will not receive certiﬁcates representing their interest in the Series 2008 Bonds purchased. Principal of and interest on the Series 2008 Bonds
will be paid by U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), to DTC, which will in turn remit such principal and interest payments to its
participants for subsequent disbursements to the beneﬁcial owners of the Series 2008 Bonds as described herein. See “APPENDIX E - DTC AND BOOK
ENTRY.”
Interest on the Series 2008 Bonds is payable semiannually on each April 1 and October 1, with the ﬁrst interest payment date being October 1,
2008. The Series 2008 Bonds are subject to redemption prior to maturity as described in this Ofﬁcial Statement. The Series 2008 Bonds are being issued
to provide funds to the Boston Housing Authority (the “Authority”) to (i) ﬁnance accelerated renovations and repairs of public housing developments

The Series 2008 Bonds are repayable from payments of Capital Fund Program moneys (“Capital Funds”) received by the Authority from HUD and

to an ACC Financing Amendment between the Authority and HUD (the “ACC Financing Amendment”), that HUD will make payments of Capital Funds
the Authority would have received under its Annual Contributions Contract (“ACC”) directly to the Trustee, rather than to the Authority, in an amount
sufﬁcient to pay debt service on the Series 2008 Bonds.
The scheduled payment of principal of and interest on the Series 2008 Bonds when due will be guaranteed under a municipal bond insurance policy
and a municipal bond insurance debt service reserve policy (collectively, the “Policies”) to be issued concurrently with the delivery of the Series 2008 Bonds

BOSTON HOUSING AUTHORITY
CAPITAL PROGRAM REVENUE BONDS, SERIES 2008
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this Official Statement is to furnish certain information in connection with the
sale by the Boston Housing Authority (the “Authority”) of its Capital Program Revenue Bonds, Series
2008 (the “Series 2008 Bonds”). The Series 2008 Bonds will be issued under the Master Trust Indenture,
dated as of April 1, 2008 (the “Master Indenture”), by and between the Authority and U.S. Bank National
Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), as supplemented and amended by the First Supplemental Trust
Indenture, dated as of April 1, 2008 (the “Supplemental Indenture” and together with the Master
Indenture, the “Indenture”), by and between the Authority and the Trustee. Certain terms used herein are
defined in APPENDIX A.
The Series 2008 Bonds are being issued to provide funds to the Authority to (i) finance the
renovations and repairs at various Authority developments, as follows: (a) as to the Charlestown
development: (1) plumbing and bathroom upgrades and repairs; (2) masonry repairs; (3) installation of
video surveillance systems; (b) as to the Mary Ellen McCormack development: (1) plumbing and
bathroom upgrades and repairs; (2) masonry repairs; (3) replacement of underground storm and sewer
lines; (c) as to the Old Colony development: (1) plumbing and bathroom upgrades and repairs; (2)
masonry repairs; (3) replacement of underground storm and sewer lines; (4) replacement of HVAC and
domestic hot water systems; (d) the upgrade of fire alarm and safety systems at 13 elderly and 2 family
properties; (e) the repair or replacement of elevators at 9 elderly properties; and (f) the repair or
replacement of portions of heating systems that will be upgraded as part of an Energy Service Contract
(ESCO) project, all pursuant to its Capital Fund Program (as described herein); (ii) pay capitalized
interest; and (iii) pay certain costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds. See
“THE AUTHORITY - Capital Plan of the Authority” and “ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS.”
The Series 2008 Bonds are Senior Obligations under the Indenture and are payable from the
Revenues pledged for payment of Senior Obligations under the terms of the Indenture. Under the
Indenture “Revenues” consist primarily of amounts paid to or for the benefit of the Authority by the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) pursuant to the “Capital Fund
Program” administered by HUD and received by the Trustee for deposit (other than into the Program
Expense Fund) pursuant to the Indenture. The Capital Fund Program provides capital funds to public
housing authorities (“PHAs”) to enable such authorities to construct, modernize, renovate or rehabilitate
public housing developments. Amounts payable to or for the benefit of the Authority pursuant to the
Capital Fund Program are subject to the availability of annual appropriations for such purposes by the
Congress of the United States of America. See “SECURITY FOR THE SERIES 2008 BONDS,” “CAPITAL
FUND PROGRAM” and “RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE SERIES 2008 BONDS.”
HUD has approved the issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds and has authorized the Authority to
pledge and assign the Capital Fund Program moneys (“Capital Funds”) pursuant to the Indenture to the
payment of the Series 2008 Bonds, pursuant to a letter from HUD to the Authority (the “HUD Approval
Letter”), the form of which is attached hereto as APPENDIX B. The Authority traditionally receives
funding from HUD pursuant to an Annual Contributions Contract (the “ACC”). Additionally, HUD and
the Authority have entered into a CFF Amendment to the ACC (the “ACC Financing Amendment”) that
provides generally for the use of Capital Funds to pay principal of and interest on the Series 2008 Bonds
1

(“Bond Debt Service”). The form of ACC Financing Amendment is attached hereto as APPENDIX C.
See “CAPITAL FUND PROGRAM - HUD Approval Letter and ACC Financing Amendment.”
THE BONDS ARE LIMITED, NOT GENERAL, OBLIGATIONS OF THE AUTHORITY
PAYABLE SOLELY FROM THE TRUST ESTATE, INCLUDING ALL REVENUES AND MONEYS
AND SECURITIES ON DEPOSIT IN ANY OF THE ACCOUNTS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE
INDENTURE (OTHER THAN THE PROGRAM EXPENSE FUND OR ANY REBATE FUND),
INCLUDING THE INVESTMENTS, IF ANY, THEREOF (OTHER THAN EARNINGS AND
INCOME DERIVED FROM AMOUNTS ON DEPOSIT IN THE PROGRAM EXPENSE FUND OR
ANY REBATE FUND), SUBJECT TO THE APPLICATION THEREOF TO THE PURPOSES AND
ON THE CONDITIONS PERMITTED BY THE INDENTURE. THE BONDS, INCLUDING THE
INTEREST THEREON, ARE PAYABLE SOLELY BY THE AUTHORITY FROM THE REVENUES
PLEDGED FOR THE PAYMENT THEREOF. THE BONDS ARE NOT A DEBT OF, AND DO NOT
PLEDGE THE FAITH, CREDIT, OR TAXING POWER OF, THE STATE, THE AUTHORITY OR
ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION NOR IN ANY EVENT SHALL THE BONDS BE PAYABLE BY
THE AUTHORITY OUT OF ANY FUNDS OR PROPERTIES OTHER THAN THOSE OF THE
AUTHORITY PLEDGED PURSUANT TO THE INDENTURE.
The Series 2008 Bonds are not a debt or liability of, or guaranteed by, the United States of
America or HUD. The full faith and credit of the United States of America is not pledged to the payment
of debt service on the Series 2008 Bonds. The payment of debt service on the Series 2008 Bonds is not
guaranteed by the United States of America or HUD.
The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), New York, New York, will act as securities depository
for the Series 2008 Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds will be issued as fully registered securities registered
in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s nominee). One fully registered Series 2008 Bond certificate will be
issued for each maturity of the Series 2008 Bonds, each in a principal amount equal to the aggregate
principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC. Individual purchases may be made
in book-entry form only, in the denominations of $5,000 and integral multiples thereof. See APPENDIX E
“ DTC AND BOOK ENTRY.”
Brief descriptions of the security for the Series 2008 Bonds, the Authority and HUD’s Capital
Fund Program are included in this Official Statement. The descriptions of the Series 2008 Bonds and
other documents are qualified in their entirety by reference to them. Copies of the Indenture and certain
other documents are available from the Authority upon request. The order and placement of materials in
this Official Statement, including the Appendices, are not to be deemed to be a determination of
relevance, materiality or relative importance, and this Official Statement, including the Appendices,
which are integral parts of this Official Statement, must be considered in its entirety. All capitalized terms
used in this Official Statement that are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to
them in APPENDIX A, which also contains summaries of certain provisions of the Indenture.
THE SERIES 2008 BONDS
The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Series 2008 Bonds. Reference is made to

qualified by such references.

General
The Series 2008 Bonds will be issued as fully registered bonds in the denominations of $5,000
and each authorized integral multiple thereof and will be dated the date of their delivery (the “Delivery
Date”). The Series 2008 Bonds will bear interest from the later of the Delivery Date or the most recent
interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until paid, payable
semiannually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, with the first interest payment date being October 1,
2008. The Series 2008 Bonds will bear interest at the rates per annum, and will mature in the principal
amounts on October 1 of each year, as set forth on the cover page of this Official Statement. Interest on
the Series 2008 Bonds will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
months. Each Series 2008 Bond shall bear interest on overdue principal and premium and, to the extent
permitted by law, on overdue interest, at the stated rate of interest borne by such Series 2008 Bond.
Principal of, and premium, if any, on the Series 2008 Bonds are payable upon presentation and
surrender thereof at the designated corporate trust office of the Trustee, or any alternate Paying Agent
named in such Series 2008 Bonds or subsequently appointed or at such other location as directed by the
Trustee. Interest on the Bonds will be paid by check or draft drawn upon the Trustee and mailed to
registered owners of the Series 2008 Bonds as of the Record Date at the addresses shown on the
registration books maintained by the Registrar, provided, that at the written request of the registered
owner of at least $1,000,000 principal amount of the Series 2008 Bonds, interest will be paid by wire
transfer or other method of transfer of immediately available funds acceptable to the Trustee and the
Authority. Payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Series 2008 Bonds will be made
in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for
the payment of public and private debts.
Redemption of Series 2008 Bonds
Optional Redemption. The Series 2008 Bonds maturing on or after April 1, 2019, are subject to
redemption prior to maturity at the option of the Authority as a whole, or in part, in integral multiples of
$5,000 in any order of their maturity as determined by the Authority (less than all of the Series 2008
Bonds of a single maturity to be selected by lot by the Trustee), on April 1, 2018, and on any date
thereafter, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of Series 2008 Bonds to be redeemed plus
accrued interest to the redemption date.
Special Optional Redemption.
The Series 2008 Bonds are subject to redemption prior to
maturity in part at any time, at a redemption price equal to the sum of the present value of the remaining
payments of principal and interest on such Series 2008 Bond discounted to the date of such redemption on
a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using the yield of the
Series 2008 Bond to be redeemed stated on the cover hereof assuming (i) for a Series 2008 Bond
originally priced greater than 100% of par, that principal is received at the earlier of the scheduled
maturity or the first optional redemption date, or (ii) for a Series 2008 Bond originally priced at par or less
than par, the principal is received at maturity, plus accrued interest to the redemption date at the direction
of HUD or the Authority in the event that HUD imposes administrative sanctions on the Authority which
would have the effect of reducing the payment of Capital Funds to the Authority in any year by at least
20%. In such case, HUD or the Authority may direct the redemption of Series 2008 Bonds from and in
the amount of the unexpended proceeds of the Series 2008 Bonds, less amounts already obligated or
encumbered for the payment of project costs or required for a debt service reserve or other structural
purposes of the issue, as determined by HUD, to be applied at the earliest permissible date, to redeem
outstanding Series 2008 Bonds. In the event of such a special optional redemption, the amount to be
applied to the redemption of each maturity of Series 2008 Bonds shall be proportionate to the ratio of the

3

amount of outstanding Series 2008 Bonds of such maturity to the total amount of Series 2008 Bonds
outstanding.
In the event the Authority determines to reduce the number of public housing units owned or
managed by it and as a result of which the level of Capital Grant Funds available to the Authority would
be reduced to a level that would result in a ratio of annual Capital Grant Funds reasonably anticipated to
be allocated in any Federal fiscal year to the Authority for Bond Debt Service being less than 3:1, the
Series 2008 Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity, at the option of the Authority, on any
date, as a whole or in part in integral multiples of $5,000 and pro-rata by maturity (less than all of the
Series 2008 Bonds of a single maturity to be selected by lot by the Trustee), at the redemption price of par
plus accrued interest to the redemption date.
Extraordinary Redemption. The Series 2008 Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to
maturity at the option of the Authority on any date as a whole, from amounts on deposit in the Project
Fund or amounts received or to be received pursuant to the Capital Fund Program, or in part in integral
multiples of $5,000 and pro-rata by maturity (less than all of the Series 2008 Bonds of a single maturity to
be selected by lot by the Trustee) to the extent amounts on deposit in the Project Fund or amounts
received or to be received pursuant to the Capital Fund Program are insufficient to permit redemption as a
whole, but only to the extent that (i) as a result of any changes in the Capital Fund Program the amount of
revenues expected to be received by the Authority relating to the Capital Fund Program are or will be in
the future insufficient to pay annual debt service on the Series 2008 Bonds, and (ii) at least one Rating
Agency has downgraded the rating on the Series 2008 Bonds to a classification below the four (4) highest
general classifications established by such Rating Agency. Such redemption shall (i) if made from
amounts received or to be received pursuant to the Capital Fund Program or other funds made available
by HUD for such purpose, be at a price of par plus accrued interest to the redemption date or (ii) if made
from amounts on deposit in the Project Fund, be at a redemption price equal to the sum of the present
value of the remaining payments of principal and interest on such Series 2008 Bond discounted to the
date of such redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
months) using the yield of the Series 2008 Bond to be redeemed stated on the cover hereof assuming (i)
for a Series 2008 Bond originally priced greater than 100% of par, that principal is received at the earlier
of the scheduled maturity or the first optional redemption date, or (ii) for a Series 2008 Bond originally
priced at par or less than par, the principal is received at maturity.
Mandatory Redemption
The Series 2008 Bonds shall be redeemed:
(i)
in whole or in part, on any date, at a redemption price of par plus accrued interest
to the redemption date from the proceeds of any insurance or condemnation award in an amount not to
exceed such award, in the event that: (A) public housing units owned by the Authority are substantially
damaged or destroyed by casualty or taken by eminent domain, (B) the proceeds of any insurance or
condemnation awards with respect thereto are not applied towards the repair, rebuilding or replacement of
such units (which, pursuant to the ACC would require HUD approval), and (C) any Rating Agency
determines, after written notice of such damage or condemnation, that the failure to apply such proceeds
to the redemption of the Series 2008 Bonds would result in a reduction or withdrawal of the underlying
rating on the Series 2008 Bonds;
(ii)
as soon as notice of redemption may be given under the Indenture, if the
Authority fails to deliver to the Trustee a written Certification that it has obligated at least 90% of the
proceeds of the Series 2008 Bonds by the second anniversary of the Closing Date, at a redemption price
equal to the sum of the present value of the remaining payments of principal and interest on such Series
4

2008 Bond discounted to the date of such redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months) using the yield of the Series 2008 Bond to be redeemed stated on the
cover hereof assuming (i) for a Series 2008 Bond originally priced greater than 100% of par, that
principal is received at the earlier of the scheduled maturity or the first optional redemption date, or (ii)
for a Series 2008 Bond originally priced at par or less than par, the principal is received at maturity.; and
(iii)
as soon as notice of redemption may be given, if unobligated proceeds of the
Bonds remain in the Project Fund 35 days prior to the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, at a
redemption price equal to the sum of the present value of the remaining payments of principal and interest
on such Series 2008 Bond discounted to the date of such redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a
360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using the yield of the Series 2008 Bond to be redeemed
stated on the cover hereof assuming (i) for a Series 2008 Bond originally priced greater than 100% of par,
that principal is received at the earlier of the scheduled maturity or the first optional redemption date, or
(ii) for a Series 2008 Bond originally priced at par or less than par, the principal is received at maturity..
With respect to the redemptions described in subparagraph (ii) above, the amount redeemed shall
equal the unexpended proceeds, less (i) amounts obligated or encumbered for the payment of Eligible
Costs, (ii) amounts required to be deposited in the Reserve Fund in order to meet the Reserve Fund
Requirement, and (iii) an amount equal to 10% of the original par amount of the Bonds on the Closing
Date. With respect to the redemptions described in subparagraph (iii) above, the amount redeemed shall
equal the unexpended proceeds less (i) amounts obligated or encumbered for the payment of Eligible
Costs, and (ii) amounts required to be deposited in the Reserve in order to meet the Reserve Fund
Requirement.
The Series 2008 Bonds shall be redeemed only in the principal amount of $5,000 and integral
multiples thereof. In the event less than all of the Series 2008 Bonds are to be redeemed, the amount to
be applied to the redemption of each maturity of the Series 2008 Bonds shall be proportionate to the ratio
of the amount of outstanding Series 2008 Bonds of such maturity to the total amount of Series 2008
Bonds outstanding. For purposes of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding Series 2008 Bonds
of a single maturity, the particular Series 2008 Bonds or portions of Series 2008 Bonds to be redeemed
shall be selected by lot not more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date by the Trustee, by such
method of lottery as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate; provided that such lottery shall provide
for the selection for redemption of Series 2008 Bonds or portions of Series 2008 Bonds in principal
amounts of $5,000 and integral multiples thereof.
With respect to any optional redemption of Series 2008 Bonds, unless moneys sufficient to pay
the redemption price of the Series 2008 Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee
prior to the giving of the notice of redemption, such notice may, at the option of the Authority, state that
such redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the
date fixed for redemption. If such moneys are not received, such notice shall be of no force and effect,
the Authority shall not redeem such Series 2008 Bonds, and the Trustee shall give notice, in the same
manner in which the notice of redemption shall have been given, that such moneys were not so received
and that such Series 2008 Bonds will not be redeemed.
Notice of Redemption
Unless waived in writing by any holder of Series 2008 Bonds to be redeemed, notice of the call
for any such redemption shall be given by the Trustee on behalf of the Authority by mailing the
redemption notice by first class mail or registered or certified mail, return receipt requested (such delivery
method to be determined by the Trustee) at least thirty (30) days and not more than sixty (60) days prior
to the date fixed for redemption to the registered owner of the Series 2008 Bond or Series 2008 Bonds to
5

be redeemed at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such other address as is furnished in writing
by such registered owner to the Trustee.
The failure to give proper notice with respect to a redemption of certain Series 2008 Bonds shall
not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of Series 2008 Bonds with respect to which
no such failure occurred.
Transfer and Exchange
Upon surrender for transfer of any Series 2008 Bond at the designated corporate trust office of the
Trustee, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Trustee and duly executed by, the registered owner or his attorney duly authorized in
writing, the Authority will execute and the Trustee will authenticate, date and deliver in the name of the
transferee or transferees a new fully registered Series 2008 Bond or Series 2008 Bonds of the same
maturity of authorized denominations, for a like aggregate principal amount. Any fully registered Series
2008 Bond or Series 2008 Bonds may be exchanged at said office of the Trustee for a like aggregate
principal amount of Series 2008 Bond or Series 2008 Bonds of the same maturity of other authorized
denominations. The Trustee shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Series 2008 Bond during
the period beginning at the close of business on the 15th day of the month next preceding any interest
payment date on such Series 2008 Bond and ending on such interest payment date nor to transfer or
exchange any Series 2008 Bond after notice calling such Series 2008 Bond for redemption has been
mailed, nor during a period of 15 days next preceding mailing of a notice of redemption of any Series
2008 Bond.
SECURITY FOR THE SERIES 2008 BONDS
General. Pursuant to the Indenture, the Authority has assigned and pledged to the Trustee the
Trust Estate, consisting of (i) all Revenues, subject, with respect to Capital Grant funds, to the availability
of annual appropriations by the United States Government of such amounts for such purpose, and (ii) all
moneys and securities from time to time held by the Trustee under the terms of the Indenture (excluding
the Program Expense Fund and any Rebate Fund and any amounts owing as rebate to the U.S. Treasury,
subject to use and application in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
The Series 2008 Bonds and all other Senior Obligations issued under the Indenture are limited,
not general, obligations of the Authority, payable solely from the Trust Estate, including all Revenues and
moneys and securities on deposit in any of the accounts established under the Indenture (other than the
Program Expense Fund and the Rebate Fund), including the investments, if any, thereof (other than
earnings and income derived from amounts on deposit in the Program Expense Fund), subject to the
application of such funds to the purposes and on the conditions permitted by the Indenture. The Series
2008 Bonds are not secured by a mortgage or security interest on any of the Authority’s assets or
properties (other than those pledged under the Indenture). See “CAPITAL FUND PROGRAM” and “RISK
FACTORS RELATING TO THE SERIES 2008 BONDS.”
The Authority will provide to HUD a schedule that sets forth the semiannual payments of
principal and interest on the Series 2008 Bonds (unless otherwise paid from Capitalized Interest). HUD
has agreed, pursuant to the ACC Financing Amendment and HUD Approval Letter, to pay directly to the
Trustee from Capital Funds available to the Authority an amount needed to pay debt service in
accordance with the schedule provided by the Authority. In order to permit such payments to be made,
the Authority shall execute and deliver each year, and present to HUD for execution and delivery, an
amendment to the ACC (the “Annual CFP Amendment to the ACC”) directing HUD to pay to the Trustee
from Capital Funds available to the Authority in the current or any prior Federal fiscal year in at least an
6

amount sufficient, together with interest earnings on amounts on deposit in the Reserve Fund, to pay the
aggregate of the deposits and bond payments required to be made by the Authority pursuant to the
Indenture from such Federal fiscal year’s Capital Funds (plus any previously unpaid amounts and/or any
amounts required to restore the Reserve Fund to the Reserve Fund Requirement) not later than 75 days
prior to the first date for the first payment of Debt Service scheduled to be made from Capital Funds
pursuant to such Annual CFP Amendment to the ACC (or the earliest date on which such Amendment
may be executed under the rules and regulations of HUD, if such date is later). The Authority further
covenants and agrees that if an Annual CFP Amendment to the ACC and/or Annual Plan (as defined
below) has not been approved by HUD with respect to all activities expected to be conducted by the
Authority pursuant to the Capital Fund Program for any particular Federal fiscal year by the later of: (i)
October 1 of the first year following the end of the applicable Federal fiscal year with respect to which
such funds were appropriated, or (ii) the earliest date upon which such Annual Plan and/or Annual CFP
Amendment to the ACC may be executed and approved under the rules and regulations of HUD, it will
submit to HUD an Annual CFP Amendment to the ACC and/or Annual Plan, as required, providing only
for payment of the deposits and payments set forth in the Indenture for the twelve month period with
respect to which payment of such amounts is to be made from Capital Funds pursuant to such Annual
CFP Amendment to the ACC plus any previously unpaid amounts due under the Indenture and/or any
amounts required to restore the Reserve Fund to the Reserve Fund Requirement (together with such other
activities that HUD agrees will not prevent or delay its approval of such plan) in order promptly to obtain
HUD’s approval of such Annual CFP Amendment to the ACC or Annual Plan, as applicable. The
Authority shall promptly provide to the Trustee copies of Annual Plans, five-year plans and Annual CFP
Amendment to the ACCs submitted to HUD.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Indenture and in no way in derogation of the
foregoing, the Authority agrees in the Indenture to requisition Capital Funds from HUD at such times and
in such manner so as to assure the timely payment of amounts due Holders of Bonds. To the extent
amounts scheduled to be received from HUD will be insufficient to pay principal, interest and Program
Expenses, due to a loss of earnings on funds held in the Reserve Fund, or for any other reason, the
Authority will take such actions as may be required to request that HUD expeditiously pay an amount
sufficient to pay such shortfall, including amending its applicable Annual CFP Amendment to the ACC or
Annual Plan to the extent required under the Capital Fund Program. See “CAPITAL FUND PROGRAM HUD Approval Letter and ACC Financing Amendment.”
Pursuant to the Indenture, the Trustee shall receive from HUD for deposit in the Revenue Fund,
from or on account of the Capital Fund Program, moneys sufficient, together with any earnings deposited
into the Revenue Fund resulting from the investment of funds in the Reserve Fund, (i) to pay the
principal, Redemption Price and interest to become due on all Outstanding Senior Obligations on each
Bond Payment Date, (ii) to replenish any deficiency in the Reserve Fund, (iii) to pay necessary and
appropriate Program Expenses due and payable for each semi-annual period next succeeding each Bond
Payment Date, and (iv) to make any deposit required to be made into the Subordinate Obligation Debt
Service Fund. Such moneys requested by the Authority (other than amounts requested to pay Program
Expenses) shall, upon receipt, constitute Revenues under the Indenture. The Trustee shall promptly
notify the Authority upon receipt of such Revenues from HUD. All amounts so received shall be
deposited in the Revenue Fund.
The Authority has covenanted under the Indenture to budget from amounts to be received
pursuant to the Capital Fund Program in each Authority fiscal year amounts sufficient to make the
deposits and bond payments required under the Indenture, and further not to budget, requisition from
HUD or expend amounts to be received pursuant to the Capital Fund Program in any Authority fiscal year
if the effect of such budget, requisition or expenditure would be to reduce the amount of Revenues to be
received by the Authority pursuant to the Capital Fund Program for such Authority fiscal year below the
7

amount needed, or adversely affect the availability of Revenues at the times required, to make the
deposits and bond payments required under the Indenture, including any amount needed to restore the
Reserve Fund to the Reserve Fund Requirement. The Authority has agreed under the Indenture to include
all such amounts in each Annual Plan submitted to HUD.
HUD has agreed to pay the Revenues directly to the Trustee on behalf of the Authority. Amounts
due to the Authority under the Capital Fund Program and not deposited with the Trustee will be used for
capital projects of the Authority and other eligible uses under the Program. Such amounts will not be
subject to the lien of the Indenture. HUD has further agreed that it will not permit disbursements of the
amounts due the Authority under the Capital Fund Program in any fiscal year for purposes other than debt
service on the Series 2008 Bonds and related costs to the extent that any such disbursement would reduce
the amounts available for such fiscal year below the amounts scheduled for debt service on the Series
2008 Bonds and related costs in such fiscal year.
Certain investment earnings on moneys held by the Trustee may be transferred to the Rebate
Fund established pursuant to the Authority Tax Certificate dated the date of delivery of the Series 2008
Bonds. Amounts held in the Rebate Fund are not pledged to secure the Series 2008 Bonds and
consequently will not be available to make payments on the Series 2008 Bonds.
Reserve Fund. The Indenture establishes a Reserve Fund to be held by the Trustee for the benefit
of the holders of the Series 2008 Bonds and any additional Bonds and requires that an amount equal to the
Reserve Fund Requirement be deposited and maintained in the Reserve Fund. “Reserve Fund
Requirement” means, with respect to the Series 2008 Bonds, as of any date of calculation, an amount
equal to the maximum Debt Service coming due on any Interest Payment Date. To the extent the amount
on deposit in the Reserve Fund is less than the Reserve Fund Requirement, funds shall be deposited
therein from Revenues until the amount on deposit therein is equal to the Reserve Fund Requirement.
The Indenture provides that all or any part of the Reserve Fund Requirement may be met by deposit with
the Trustee of a Debt Reserve Credit Instrument. The Reserve Fund Requirement initially will be met
with the provision of the Reserve Policy. See APPENDIX A, “DEFINITIONS; SUMMARY OF CERTAIN
PROVISIONS OF THE INDENTURE - ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTS AND APPLICATION THEREOF Reserve Fund” and “BOND INSURANCE - Debt Service Reserve Insurance Policy.”
Additional Bonds. The Indenture provides that the Authority may issue additional Series of
Bonds from time to time subsequent to the issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds on a parity with the Series
2008 Bonds and secured by an equal charge and lien on the Revenues and assets pledged under the
Indenture if the Authority files with the Trustee with a copy to the Bond Insurer (a) HUD’s written
approval of the issuance of such additional Bonds, and (b) a Certificate demonstrating that the lesser of
(y) the Capital Funds received by the Authority in the immediately preceding Federal fiscal year, and (z)
the average annual amount of Capital Funds moneys received by the Authority in the three Federal fiscal
years immediately preceding the issuance of the additional Bonds equals or exceeds an amount equal to
three times Maximum Annual Debt Service determined in reference to all outstanding Bonds under the
Indenture and the additional Bonds proposed to be issued; provided, however, that such multiple may be
less than three (3) upon (i) written consent of each Bond Insurer, and (ii) advice from each Rating Agency
that such lower multiple will not result in a lower underlying rating on the then Outstanding Bonds than
the rating in effect prior to the issuance of the additional Bonds. Additional Senior Obligations consisting
of Credit Facilities may be incurred on the conditions and as provided in the Indenture. The Series 2008
Bonds are the first bonds to be issued under the Indenture. There are no other bonds outstanding under
the Indenture.
Subordinated Debt. The Indenture provides that the Authority may issue Subordinate Obligations
from time to time under other indentures or resolutions of the Authority secured by (i) the pledge of
8

amounts which may be withdrawn from the Subordinate Obligation Debt Service Fund as long as such
pledge is expressly junior and subordinate to the pledge in favor of Senior Obligations contained in the
Indenture or (ii) assets and revenues of the Authority other than the Revenues and assets pledged pursuant
to the Indenture. Subordinate Obligations may only be issued with the express written consent of HUD.

“POLICIES”) HAS BEEN FURNISHED BY FINANCIAL SECURITY ASSURANCE INC. (THE
“INSURER” OR “FINANCIAL SECURITY”) FOR USE IN THIS OFFICIAL STATEMENT.
REFERENCE IS MADE TO APPENDIX F FOR SPECIMENS OF THE POLICIES.
Bond Insurance Policy
Concurrently with the issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds, Financial Security will issue the Bond
Policy. The Bond Policy guarantees the scheduled payment of principal of and interest on the Series 2008
Bonds when due as set forth in the form of the Bond Policy included as an exhibit to this Official
Statement.
The Policy is not covered by any insurance security or guaranty fund established under New
York, California, Connecticut or Florida insurance law.
Debt Service Reserve Insurance Policy
Application has been made to Financial Security for a commitment to issue the Reserve Policy
for credit to the Reserve Fund. Pursuant to the Reserve Policy, Financial Security will unconditionally
and irrevocably agree to pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Registered Owners, subject to the terms
of the Reserve Policy, that portion of the principal of and interest on the Series 2008 Bonds that shall
become Due for Payment but shall be unpaid by reason of Nonpayment by the Issuer (as such terms are
defined in the Reserve Policy).

Financial Security will make payment as provided in the Reserve Policy to the Trustee on the
later of the business day on which such principal and interest becomes Due for Payment or the business
day next following the business day on which Financial Security shall have received Notice of
Nonpayment, in a form reasonably satisfactory to it. Payment by Financial Security to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Registered Owners shall, to the extent thereof, discharge the obligation of Financial
Security under the Reserve Policy. Upon such payment, Financial Security shall become entitled to
reimbursement of the amount so paid (together with interest and expenses) pursuant to the Indenture from
Revenues. Financial Security shall, to the extent it makes any payment of principal of or interest on the
Bonds, become subrogated to the rights of the recipients of such payments in accordance with the terms
of the Reserve Policy.
The amount available under the Reserve Policy for payment shall not exceed the Policy Limit (as
such term is defined in the Reserve Policy), initially $6,734,250, which shall never exceed the Reserve
Fund Requirement. The amount available at any particular time to be paid to the Trustee under the terms
of the Reserve Policy shall automatically be reduced by any payment under the Reserve Policy.
However, after such payment, the amount available under the Reserve Policy shall be reinstated in full or
in part, but only up to the Policy Limit, to the extent of the reimbursement of such payment (exclusive of
interest and expenses) to Financial Security by or on behalf of the Issuer.
Payment under the Reserve Policy shall not be available with respect to (a) any Nonpayment that
occurs prior to the Effective Date or after the Termination Date (as such dates are set forth in the Reserve
Policy) thereof or (b) Bonds that are not outstanding under the Indenture. If the amount payable under the
Reserve Policy is also payable under another insurance policy insuring the Bonds, payment first shall be
made under the Reserve Policy to the extent of the amount available under the Reserve Policy up to the
Policy Limit, subject to the terms of the Indenture. In no event shall Financial Security incur duplicate
liability for the same amounts owing with respect to the Bonds that are covered under the Reserve Policy
and any other insurance policy that Financial Security has issued.

THE AUTHORITY
The Authority is a public agency that provides subsidized housing to low and moderate income
individuals and families. In addition to conventional public housing within the City of Boston, the
Authority administers rental assistance programs such as the Section 8 program. The Authority receives
federal and state assistance in order to operate these programs and, as such, is governed by any applicable
housing regulations issued by HUD and the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community
Development.
The Authority was established by the Mayor and City Council in October of 1935 in accordance
with the provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 121B. By enactment of Chapter 88 of
the Acts of 1989, approved May 23, 1989, the Authority is managed and controlled by an administrator
who is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the Mayor of the City of Boston.
Effective April 8, 1996, Mayor Thomas M. Menino appointed Sandra B. Henriquez as
Administrator, with “the power and authority to act as the Mayor’s agent with respect to all matters
affecting the BHA, including without limitation the power to execute any and all documents as needed
with such matters.” Also pursuant to this Chapter 88 of the Acts of 1989, the Monitoring Committee,
comprised of nine members, including at least five public housing tenants, is appointed by the Mayor
periodically to review certain matters relating to the management and performance of the Authority and to
report thereon to the Mayor.
In keeping with its mission, the Authority has established specific policies governing eligibility
both for admission to and continued occupancy of all its public housing developments and units. Housing
developments are built and operated with either federal or state financial assistance. The federal program
dates back to the initial occupancy of the Mary Ellen McCormack Houses in May of 1938. State
legislation in 1948 initiated the state-aided program.
The Authority currently owns approximately 13,000 units of housing in Boston and houses about
27,000 people under the public housing program. The Authority has 63 developments, a few of which
have both state and federal components. Of the 63 developments, 37 are designated as elderly/disabled
developments and 26 are designated as family developments. Three of the 26 family developments have
elderly/disabled units for families. The Authority owns and manages some scattered site properties
throughout the City of Boston as well.
In addition, the Authority helps provide housing to approximately 25,000 under its rental
assistance voucher program. The Authority administers approximately 11,000 rental assistance vouchers
11

that allow families to rent in the private market and apply a subsidy to their rent. With this assistance,
residents are able to pay approximately 30-40 percent of their income toward rent and the Authority pays
the remainder.
The following are key employees of the Authority:
Sandra B. Henriquez, Administrator
Ms. Henriquez was appointed by the Mayor of Boston as “Administrator” (chief executive
officer) of the BHA early in 1996 and also to a City of Boston cabinet position as Chief of Public
Housing. Prior to her appointment Ms. Henriquez was a principal of Maloney Properties, Inc., a private
management firm. She has also served as Director of Property Management at the Massachusetts
Executive Office of Communities and Development and previously at the Authority in various managerial
positions.
William McGonagle, Deputy Administrator
Mr. McGonagle has been an employee of the Authority since 1970 in increasingly responsible
positions including that of Housing Manager, Area Director for Operations, and Deputy Administrator
since 1992.
Hollis Young, General Counsel
Ms. Young became General Counsel in 1996. Prior to that time she served as general counsel for
the Cambridge (MA) Housing Authority, Chief Counsel for the Massachusetts Executive Office of
Communities and Development, and Director of Development for the City of New Haven, Connecticut.
Gail Livingston, Director of Property Management and Operations
Ms. Livingston has been with the Authority since 2000. Prior to the BHA, she worked as a
consultant to public housing authorities on a range of issues including property management training. In
addition, she has held various positions with the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority in Cleveland,
Ohio.
Shirley Ransom, Director of Capital Construction
Ms. Ransom has been with the Authority since 1995 managing capital construction projects and,
since 2001, serving as Director of the Authority’s Capital Construction Department. Prior experience
includes architecture and design work for various firms. She has been a professionally registered architect
in Massachusetts since 1987.
Deborah Morse, Director of Real Estate Development
Ms. Morse has served as Director of Real Estate Development since 2003. Prior to the BHA, she
worked as a consultant to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and several public
housing authorities in planning and implementing complex neighborhood-wide revitalization plans.

CAPITAL PLAN OF THE AUTHORITY
In January 2006, the Authority, through its Capital Construction Department, undertook a
detailed needs assessment of the short and medium term capital needs of the Authority’s federal public
housing portfolio. Although the Authority has a five-year capital plan that is prepared each year as part of
its HUD-required Annual Plan submission, the detailed needs assessment was meant to record needs in
more detail and further into the future.
The Authority considered this assessment when selecting the capital projects to be completed
using the proceeds of the Series 2008 Bonds. The Authority applied the following criteria to make the
selection:
x
x
x
x

Projects of a scope that exceeds the usual annual capital allocation;
Projects that will have a significant positive impact on operating costs in the future;
Projects involving life safety issues; and
Projects that will leverage additional funds for energy conservation and upgrade projects.

The selected projects include:
x
x
x
x
x

Bathroom and plumbing repair and replacements at the three largest family properties:
Charlestown, Mary Ellen McCormack and Old Colony. These systems are all over fifty years
old and have not had a comprehensive upgrade in this time.
The upgrade of fire alarm and safety systems at 13 elderly and 2 family properties.
The repair or replacement of elevators at 9 elderly properties.
The repair or replacement of portions of heating systems that will be upgraded as part of an
Energy Service Contract (“ESCO”) project. The investment of Authority capital in this project
will allow the completion of more heating system upgrades than the ESCO alone.
Additional projects such as building envelope repairs and security upgrades will be included if
the budget permits.

The Authority has begun to procure design services to further define the scope of work for the
selected projects. As this work proceeds and a more accurate budget is developed, there may be
alterations in the plan.

CAPITAL FUND PROGRAM
Public Housing Program
Public Housing Generally. The public housing program was created by the United States
Housing Act of 1937, as amended (42 U.S.C. §1437) (the “1937 Act”) to provide improved housing for
low-income households and to stimulate employment in the construction industry during the Great
Depression. Under the system established by the 1937 Act, local governments adopted legislation to
create PHAs. PHAs develop, own, operate and maintain housing for rental to low-income families (those
with incomes at or below 80% of area median income) and very low-income families (those with incomes
at or below 50% of area median income). Currently, the 1937 Act requires, generally, that at least 40% of
the public housing units of a particular PHA which become available in a given year be rented to families
with incomes at or below 30% of area median income.
Since 1965, the public housing program has been administered at the Federal level by HUD. Of
the approximately 1.1 million public housing units in the United States, which are divided among
approximately 13,000 developments, nearly ninety percent were constructed prior to 1975. Average total
family income for families in public housing as of 2004 was $10,768. Seventy-seven percent of public
housing families had annual incomes below 30% of area median income.
Funding. Historically, the Federal Government has paid nearly all of the costs of developing,
maintaining, modernizing and operating public housing to the extent that rents collected from tenants
were insufficient for those purposes. PHAs generally financed the construction of public housing by
issuing tax-exempt bonds, with respect to which principal and interest payments were guaranteed by the
Federal Government through forty-year subsidy contracts known as Annual Contributions Contracts
(“ACCs”), or through direct loans from HUD under the ACCs, while property rents paid operating costs.
Rents were set at a level sufficient to pay those costs.
Throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, as average tenant incomes in public housing declined,
tenants paid an increasing share of income for rent. In response to concerns over rent burdens and the
ability of PHAs to meet operating costs, the Federal Government, beginning in 1969, made significant
14

changes to the public housing program. Tenant rental payments were limited to 25% of household
income, resulting in a substantial reduction in rent receipts for PHAs. (The limit on tenant rental
payments was increased to 30% of tenant income in 1981.) To offset this loss of income, the Federal
Government provided funds to PHAs for the operation and maintenance of public housing. These Federal
operating subsidies rose from $75 million in 1970 to more than $1 billion annually ten years later.
Renovation—Modernization Programs and Funding. The original funding mechanism for public
housing construction did not provide funding for a capital replacement reserve or for modernization. As
the public housing stock aged and operating revenues declined, capital replacement and repair needs
grew, and as a result, in 1968, HUD and Congress began a series of efforts to fund major repairs and
renovation - referred to generally under the term “modernization.” Initially, modernization costs were
paid by HUD through the ACCs, either by increasing amounts payable under the original ACC with
respect to a project or through a separate contract. In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive
Improvement Assistance Program (“CIAP”), which provided modernization funds to PHAs through a
grant process based on need. After 1986, the Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Projects (“MROP”)
program increased modernization funding, targeting the most seriously deteriorated properties. Between
1981 and 1990, more than $12 billion in CIAP and MROP modernization funding was approved. See
Table 2 below.
Modernization funding was increased and the method of funding for large PHAs was changed in
1990 with the adoption of the Comprehensive Grant Program (“Comp Grant”). Comp Grant was limited
to PHAs with more than 250 units and, unlike CIAP, was a formula based program, under which large
PHAs were assured of receiving capital funding based on their size, modernization needs and replacement
needs, among other criteria. The CIAP program continued to serve smaller PHAs.
Establishment of the Capital Fund Program; Annual Allocations
In 1998, Congress passed the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act (“QHWRA”), which
contained a major revision of the public housing laws. QHWRA amended Section 9 of the 1937 Act to
replace the Comp Grant and CIAP programs with a new Capital Fund Program for PHAs. Under the
Capital Fund Program, PHAs receive formula-based capital funding grants from HUD which may be
used, among other things, to finance the renovation and modernization of public housing developments.
The amount of Capital Fund subsidies allocated to each PHA, including the Authority, is set
according to formulas developed by HUD through negotiated rulemaking procedures, taking into account
factors provided by the statute. As set forth in Section 9(d)(2) of the 1937 Act, these factors include: (i)
the number of public housing units owned, assisted or operated by the PHA; (ii) the PHA’s need to carry
out rehabilitation, modernization and other activities for its public housing units, taking into account both
backlog and future needs; (iii) housing construction and rehabilitation costs in the area; (iv) the PHA’s
need to provide a “safe and secure environment” in its public housing; and (v) the PHA’s record of
“exemplary performance” in operating its public housing. The Secretary is empowered to consider
additional factors.
HUD has issued a final rule governing Capital Fund allocations. The Capital Fund allocation rule
is set forth at 24 C.F.R. Part 905. The Capital Funds, which are allocated annually by HUD, based upon
annual appropriations from the Congress, represent the major source of funding for modernization and
other capital activities of PHAs and are the source of the moneys pledged by the Authority for payment of
the Bonds.
As with all other aspects of the Capital Fund Program, the allocation formula is subject to
periodic review by the Congress and change at any time, whether by law or HUD regulation.

Capital Fund Authorization and Appropriations by Congress
Under Article I, § 9 of the United States Constitution, the power to appropriate funds to be spent
by the Federal Government belongs to the Congress. Typically, when Congress creates a new program
such as the Capital Fund Program, it authorizes the expenditure of Federal funds in the prescribed manner
for the stated purposes. This authorizing legislation may limit the amount of money to be spent on a
given purpose and/or the period of time in which the program may operate, or it may establish the
program permanently and permit the spending of such funds as may be necessary for the legislative
purpose. In either such event, in addition to an expenditure of funds being generally authorized by law,
the amounts to be spent must also be specifically appropriated by the Congress. Appropriations are
typically made in various Appropriations Acts that fund the operation of all activities of the Federal
Government. Appropriations Acts are normally adopted annually by Congress, as an outcome of the
process by which the Executive Branch proposes a budget to Congress and the elements of that budget are
negotiated within Congress and between Congress and the President.
Section 519(a) of QHWRA authorized the appropriation of $3 billion for the Capital Fund
Program for Federal fiscal year 1999, and such sums as may be necessary for Federal fiscal years 2000
through 2003. Although there is no authorization for appropriations under the Capital Fund Program after
Federal fiscal year 2003, this program remains in effect and Congress has provided appropriations for the
program each fiscal year. See Table 1 and “RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE BONDS -Termination of
Capital Fund Program.”
History of Modernization Funding
Appropriations.
The amount of funds appropriated by Congress for public housing
modernization has varied from year to year. Table 1 below shows such appropriations between 1975 and
2008. The column headed “President’s Budget” reflects the budget formally proposed to the Congress by
the President for the applicable public housing modernization program(s) for the Federal fiscal years
listed. The column headed “Enacted Appropriation Utilized” reflects the actual appropriations by the
Congress for such programs for the particular Federal fiscal years, adjusted by rescission, carryovers and
technical items. Data is not presented for Federal fiscal years prior to 1975, because prior to the
enactment of the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the means by which such expenditures
were expressed were not comparable to those used in subsequent years. Specifically, Presidential
Budgets through Federal fiscal year 1975 and Congressional Appropriations Acts through Federal fiscal
year 1974 did not calculate “budget authority,” which is the primary measure of Federal spending
authority today.

The actual amount appropriated for FY 1975 was $1,577,040,000; however, all but $800 million represented a “catch-up appropriation” for
the preceding Federal fiscal year.

Allocations of Modernization Funds by HUD. Once Congress has appropriated funds for
modernization, HUD is responsible for allocating those funds among the PHAs. The following table
17

shows total annual HUD allocations to PHAs for the different modernization programs from 1968 to
2007. The categories of expenditure relate to the various funding methods and programs discussed at
“Public Housing Program - Renovation—Modernization Programs and Funding,” above. “Extended
Amortization” refers to the period in which modernization was paid for through amendments to existing
ACCs, and assumes equal distribution of the amounts over the period. “20-Year Mod Program” refers to
the period in which modernization was funded through separate 20-year ACCs. The acronyms “CIAP,”
“MROP” and “CFP” refer, respectively, to the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program, the
Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Projects Program and the Capital Fund Program, all discussed above.
Amounts allocated by HUD for modernization in a year (beginning with Federal fiscal year 1987) may
vary from the appropriation figure for such year, as shown in Table 1, principally because of set-asides
for other uses appropriated within this account.

Beginning with Federal fiscal year 1987, HUD changed the manner in which it accounted for allocations of modernization funds to PHAs.
Previously, HUD calculated allocations to PHAs in terms that did not relate directly to Congressional appropriations for the particular
Federal fiscal year in which an actual commitment of funds was made. The pre-fiscal year 1987 amounts in Table 2 are not comparable
either to amounts for corresponding years in Table 1 or to later amounts in Table 2. The tables, although different, show the trends in
modernization funding. In 1987, under new legislative authority, HUD began accounting for modernization expenditures by means of
“capital cost” or “grant” levels, directly comparable to the means by which funds were appropriated.

Withholding of Capital Funds
The 1937 Act requires PHAs to obligate for expenditure at least 90% of their allocation of Capital
Funds within 24 months of the date such funds become available to the PHA (or of the date on which
adequate funds to undertake modernization, substantial rehabilitation or new construction are
accumulated) (the “Obligation Requirement”). A PHA cannot be awarded Capital Funds for any month
during a fiscal year in which such PHA has unobligated Capital Funds in violation of the Obligation
Requirement. However, if a PHA cures its failure to obligate the previously allocated Capital Funds
within such fiscal year, Capital Funds will be made available to the PHA in an amount proportional to the
number of months remaining in such fiscal year.
The Secretary of HUD may grant extensions to a PHA giving it more time to obligate its Capital
Funds. The Secretary may extend the applicable period for up to 12 months based on the size of a PHA,
the complexity of its Capital Funds program, any limitation on the PHA’s ability to obligate Capital
Funds as a result of state or local law, or for any other reason determined by the Secretary to be relevant.
In addition, the Secretary may grant an extension for such period as the Secretary determines to be
necessary if the Secretary determines that the failure to timely obligate the Capital Funds is due to
litigation, obtaining approvals from the Federal, state or local government, complying with environmental
assessment and abatement requirements, relocating residents, or an event beyond the control of the PHA,
or for any other reason established by the Secretary pursuant to a notice published in the Federal Register.
The HUD Approval Letter states that Capital Fund Program requirements are applicable to the
use of the proceeds of the Series 2008 Bonds, presumably including the Obligation Requirement, as well
as the expenditure requirement referenced below. To the extent bond proceeds remain unobligated or
unexpended in violation of such requirements, those proceeds must be used to redeem bonds. See
“Redemption of Series 2008 Bonds” and “CAPITAL FUND PROGRAM - HUD Approval Letter and ACC
Financing Amendment.”
In addition to the Obligation Requirement discussed above, PHAs are required to expend Capital
Funds within four years of the date on which such funds become available to the PHA for obligation (the
“Expenditure Requirement”). Failure to do so may result in recapture of the funds upon action by the
Secretary of HUD.
The Authority has in the past never failed to comply with, and is currently in compliance with,
the Obligation Requirement and the Expenditure Requirement. Internal control and monitoring systems
are in place to ensure that the Authority meets or exceeds all Obligation Requirements and Expenditure
Requirements in a timely manner. Table 3 below sets forth the historical compliance with the Obligation
Requirement and the Expenditure Requirement.

The form of the ACC Financing Amendment is attached as APPENDIX C.

RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE SERIES 2008 BONDS
The factors discussed below should be considered in evaluating the ability of the Authority to
make payments in amounts sufficient to provide for payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on the Series 2008 Bonds. This discussion of the risk factors involved in purchasing and owning
the Series 2008 Bonds is not, and is not intended to be, exhaustive.
General
The Bonds are limited, not general, obligations of the Authority payable solely from the Trust
Estate, including all Revenues and moneys and securities on deposit in any of the Accounts established
under the Indenture (other than the Program Expense Fund or any Rebate Fund), including the
investments, if any, thereof (other than earnings and income derived from amounts on deposit in the
Program Expense Fund or any Rebate Fund), subject to the application thereof to the purposes and on the
conditions permitted by the Indenture. The Bonds, including the interest thereon, are payable solely by the
Authority from the Revenues pledged for the payment thereof. The Bonds are not a debt of, and do not
pledge the faith, credit, or taxing power of, the State, the Authority or any political subdivision nor in any
event shall the Bonds be payable by the Authority out of any funds or properties other than those of the
Authority pledged pursuant to the Indenture. See “SECURITY FOR THE SERIES 2008 BONDS.”
The ability of the Authority to make payments in amounts sufficient to provide for payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Series 2008 Bonds could be adversely affected by the
occurrence of certain events, including, without limitation, the events and circumstances described below.
Any of these events could adversely affect the ability of the Authority to make payments on the Series
2008 Bonds. Some of these risks are discussed in more detail below.

21

Delay, Reduction or Elimination of Appropriations
Since 1968, Congress has provided funds to PHAs for public housing modernization in the
amounts and under the conditions discussed above. See “CAPITAL FUND PROGRAM - History of
Modernization Funding” above for information regarding historical levels of appropriations by Congress
to HUD. Appropriations must be determined by Congress each year. There can be no assurance that
Congress will reauthorize the expenditure of Capital Funds, maintain appropriations for the Capital Fund
Program at levels sufficient to assure payment of the Series 2008 Bonds or make a specific year’s
appropriation under the Capital Fund Program in a timely manner. A decrease in the level of appropriated
funds by Congress to HUD or a delay in appropriations could have a materially adverse effect on the
Authority’s ability to pay Bond Debt Service.
Withholding of Capital Funds
The Secretary of HUD is required to withhold a portion of Capital Funds that would otherwise be
allocated to a PHA if the PHA fails to obligate its Capital Funds within the time period required by the
1937 Act. See “CAPITAL FUND PROGRAM - Withholding of Capital Funds” above.
Any such withholding may have a materially adverse effect on the Authority’s ability to pay
Bond Debt Service. The likelihood of any potential withholding of Capital Funds adversely affecting the
Authority’s ability to pay Bond Debt Service is reduced by a number of factors, including:
1.

The Secretary of HUD may grant extensions of time to obligate for a wide variety of

reasons.
2.
Unobligated amounts are disregarded if they do not exceed 10% of the original amount
made available.
3.
If the Authority cures its failure to obligate a prior year’s Capital Funds, the Authority
shall receive for the then-current fiscal year a share equal to its original share multiplied by a fraction
equal to the number of months remaining in the year subsequent to the month in which the cure occurred,
divided by 12.
4.

Bond Debt Service is equal to not more than one-third of its Capital Fund allocation for

2006.
5.
HUD has agreed that Bond Debt Service may be paid from any Capital Funds, including
any unobligated funds. Accordingly, to the extent that the withholding of a particular year’s allocation of
Capital Funds is due to the presence of unobligated funds in violation of the 1937 Act’s obligation
deadlines, those earlier unobligated funds would be available to enable the Authority to pay Bond Debt
Service. Such payment would also help to cure the condition giving rise to the withholding of Capital
Funds.
6.
If unobligated Capital Funds remaining from prior fiscal years are insufficient fully to
meet debt service requirements in a particular year and the application of such funds comes too late in the
year to permit receipt of sufficient funds in the current year to permit full payment of debt service with
such current amounts, Liquidity Accounts may be used to pay Bond Debt Service. Full application of
amounts remaining unobligated from prior years to Bond Debt Service would enable the Authority to
receive a full allocation of Capital Funds for the subsequent fiscal year, enabling it to restore its Liquidity
Account and pay current Bond Debt Service.

22

7.
Bond Debt Service once paid cannot be recaptured because such amounts are obligated
and expended on a current, ongoing basis.
8.
If and to the extent that the failure to obligate proceeds of the Series 2008 Bonds within
24 months of their receipt constitutes a violation of the Obligation Requirement, and such violation would
result in use of such proceeds to redeem bonds. that redemption would cure any such violation
The Authority has never failed to timely obligate or expend Capital Funds.
Termination of Capital Fund Program
As described above under “CAPITAL FUND PROGRAM - Capital Fund Authorization and
Appropriations by Congress,” the funding authorization for the Capital Fund Program expired at the end
of Federal fiscal year 2003. As is discussed above under “CAPITAL FUND PROGRAM - Public Housing
Program - Renovation-Modernization Programs and Funding,” HUD and the Congress have provided
assistance to PHAs for modernization and other capital activities in a variety of forms. There can be no
assurance that the Congress will maintain the Capital Fund Program in its present form or reauthorize the
expenditure of funds thereunder. Although the Authority has pledged to the Series 2008 Bonds amounts
received under any successor to the Capital Funds Program, there can be no assurance that, upon
discontinuation or termination of the Capital Fund Program, a substantially similar program will be
established by the Congress in lieu of the Capital Fund Program or that amounts provided under any such
successor will be comparable to those provided under the Capital Fund Program. Accordingly, a
discontinuation or termination of the Capital Fund Program could result in decreased funding by HUD to
the Authority for capital needs and could have a material adverse effect on the Authority’s ability to pay
Bond Debt Service.
Change in Allocation Formula
As described above under “CAPITAL FUND PROGRAM - Establishment of the Capital Fund
Program; Annual Allocations,” HUD allocates amounts to PHAs under the Capital Fund Program on the
basis of a formula authorized by law (the “Capital Funds Formula”). As described above under “CAPITAL
FUND PROGRAM - History of Modernization Funding,” HUD has allocated amounts to PHAs under
predecessor programs for the modernization of public housing by formula or upon such other bases as
were established by the Congress with respect to the particular program. There can be no assurance that
Congress will not change the basis upon which moneys will be allocated to PHAs (including the
Authority) under the Capital Fund Program (or any successor thereto). There can be no assurance that
HUD will not change the manner in which the Capital Funds Formula for calculating amounts allocated to
PHAs (including the Authority) under the Capital Fund Program is determined or applied. A change in
the Capital Funds Formula or the basis upon which amounts under the Capital Fund Program (or any
successor thereto) are allocated to PHAs could decrease the amount of such funds allocated by HUD to
the Authority and could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on the Authority’s ability to pay Bond
Debt Service.
Reduction in Allocation Under Formula
There can be no assurance that changes in the operations of the Authority will not have an
adverse effect on allocations of Capital Fund Program monies under the current Capital Funds Formula or
any successor thereto. There is no assurance that the Authority’s allocations of Capital Funds will not be
reduced in any year through application of the Capital Funds Formula, as a result of a reduction in the
number of units eligible for improvements funded by Capital Funds or otherwise. Any change in the
status of the Authority’s inventory of public housing units and/or operations considered for purposes of
23

the current or any future Capital Funds Formula could decrease the amount of such funds allocated by
HUD to the Authority and could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on the Authority’s ability to
pay Bond Debt Service.
Other Changes in Law or Regulations
There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations presently applicable to the Capital Fund
Program will not be rescinded, revised or supplemented in such a way as to have a materially adverse
effect on the Authority’s ability to pay Bond Debt Service.
HUD Administrative Sanctions
The Capital Fund Program and the public housing program generally operate under a series of
regulations and requirements prescribed by the 1937 Act and by HUD pursuant to its administrative
authority over those programs. Various sanctions may be imposed upon PHAs that violate HUD program
requirements, including, under specified circumstances, the withholding of funds to which a PHA might
otherwise be entitled. The statute provides for various extensions and exceptions which would avoid the
withholding of assistance in particular cases. HUD regulations permit withholding of assistance in other
circumstances, as well. In addition, there can be no assurance that HUD and the Congress will not
impose additional conditions upon the receipt of assistance pursuant to the Capital Fund Program or any
successor, with which the Authority may be unable to comply.
HUD has agreed that, except as required by law, it will not assert any claim or right under the
ACC, including the exercise of administrative sanctions and remedies, if and to the extent that the effect
of such claim or right would be to reduce the payment of Capital Funds to the Authority below the level
necessary to pay Bond Debt Service or delay the time for payment of such moneys such that the required
amounts would not be available to pay Bond Debt Service when due.
Pursuant to the 1937 Act and contracts entered into by HUD and public housing authorities
throughout the country, in the event of a substantial default in the performance of the obligations of a
public housing authority thereunder, HUD is entitled to pursue a wide range of administrative sanctions
and remedies, including requiring possession of a PHA’s assets to be transferred to HUD and the “taking
over” of full management and operational control from such PHA. Such a takeover would not impair the
payment of Bond Debt Service. The Authority has covenanted to comply with the requirements of the
Capital Fund Program.
Federal Budget Delays
Capital Funds for a particular Federal fiscal year generally become available near the end of each
Federal fiscal year, and this delay has been taken into account in structuring Bond Debt Service payments.
In the event that Federal appropriations are delayed, the Authority’s receipt of Capital Funds may also be
delayed. In the event of a delay, Congress has traditionally provided interim funding to federal agencies
until final appropriation bills are enacted; however, there can be no assurance of any such interim
funding.
Enforceability against HUD
HUD has no obligation with respect to the Series 2008 Bonds. Neither the holders of the Series
2008 Bonds nor the Trustee acting on their behalf, has any right or remedy against HUD to enforce
payment of the Capital Funds necessary to repay the Series 2008 Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds are
secured solely by the Trust Estate, which is comprised mainly of Capital Funds once received.

No Acceleration or Redemption upon Loss of Tax Exemption
The Authority has covenanted and agreed in the Indenture to comply with the applicable
provisions of the Code relating to the exclusion from gross income of the interest payable on the Series
2008 Bonds for federal income tax purposes, and the Indenture contains covenants and procedures
designed to assure compliance with such provisions. The failure by the Authority to comply with such
provisions will not give rise to a redemption or acceleration of the Series 2008 Bonds. Consequently,
interest on the Series 2008 Bonds may become includable in gross income for purposes of federal income
taxation retroactively to the date of issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds by reason of the Authority’s failure
to comply with the requirements of federal tax law. See “TAX MATTERS.” There is no provision for a
redemption of Series 2008 Bonds or for an increase in the rate of interest payable thereon upon the
occurrence of such an event.
Early Redemption
A variety of factors described herein may result in an early redemption of the Series 2008 Bonds,
including a redemption at par if the source of the funds for such redemption is not amounts in the Project
Fund. See “THE BONDS - Redemption of Bonds.” The possibility of an early redemption could affect
the ability of the Series 2008 Bonds to be valued or sold with a market premium. Early redemption
would also result in a Bondholder not receiving any market premium upon the redemption of his or her
Series 2008 Bond.

RATINGS
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) has assigned its municipal bond rating of AAA to
the Series 2008 Bonds with the understanding that the Policy will by issued by the Insurer, and has
assigned an underlying rating of AA. Any explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained
only from S&P. There is no assurance that such ratings will be maintained for any given period of time
or that such ratings may not be raised, lowered or withdrawn entirely if in the judgment of S&P
circumstances so warrant. Any downward change in or withdrawal of the ratings may have an adverse
effect on the price at which those Series 2008 Bonds may be resold.

UNDERWRITING
Lehman Brothers (the “Underwriter”) has agreed to purchase all (but not less than all) of the
Series 2008 Bonds at an aggregate purchase price of $80,870,185.30 (representing the aggregate principal
amount of $78,550,000 plus net original issue premium of $2,320,185.30). The Underwriter has agreed
to purchase all of the Series 2008 Bonds if any are purchased. The Underwriter may offer and sell Series
2008 Bonds to certain dealers (including dealers depositing Series 2008 Bonds into investment trusts) and
others at prices lower than the offering prices stated on the cover of this Official Statement. After the
initial public offering, the public offering prices of the Series 2008 Bonds may be changed from time to
time by the Underwriter. The Authority has agreed to pay the Underwriters a fee of $567,375 in
connection with the underwriting of the Series 2008 Bonds.

TAX MATTERS
Bond Counsel is of the opinion that, under existing law and assuming continuing compliance with
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), interest on the Series 2008 Bonds is excluded
from gross income for federal income tax purposes. This opinion is expressly conditioned upon compliance
with certain requirements of the Code, which requirements must be satisfied subsequent to the date of
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds in order to assure that interest on the Series 2008 Bonds is and continues
to be excludable from the gross income of holders of the Series 2008 Bonds. Failure to so comply could
cause interest on the Series 2008 Bonds to be included in the gross income of the holders thereof, retroactive
to the date of issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds. In particular, and without limitation, those requirements
include restrictions on the use, expenditure and investment of proceeds and payment of rebate, or penalties
in lieu of rebate, to the United States, subject to certain exceptions. The Authority has covenanted as to
continued compliance with such requirements.
In the opinion of Bond Counsel, under existing law, interest on the Series 2008 Bonds will not
constitute a preference item under section 57(a)(5) of the Code for purposes of computation of the
alternative minimum tax imposed on certain individuals and corporations under section 55 of the Code,
although interest on the Series 2008 Bonds is included in the adjusted current earnings of certain
corporations for the purpose of calculating the alternative minimum tax imposed on such corporations.
Bond Counsel has not opined as to other federal tax consequences of holding the Series 2008
Bonds. However, prospective purchasers should be aware that (i) section 265 of the Code denies a deduction
for interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry the Series 2008 Bonds or, in the case
of a financial institution, that portion of a holder’s interest expense allocated to interest on the Series 2008
Bonds, (ii) with respect to insurance companies subject to the tax imposed by section 831 of the Code,
section 832(b)(5)(1) reduces the deduction for losses incurred by 15 percent of the sum of certain items,
including interest on the Series 2008 Bonds, (iii) interest on the Series 2008 Bonds earned by certain foreign
corporations doing business in the United States could be subject to a branch profits tax imposed by section
884 of the Code, (iv) passive investment income, including interest on the Series 2008 Bonds, may be
subject to federal income taxation under section 1375 of the Code for any S corporations that have
Subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of the taxable year if greater than 25% of the gross receipts of
such S corporation is passive investment income, (v) section 86 of the Code requires recipients of certain
Social Security and Railroad Retirement benefits to take into account in determining gross income, receipts
or accruals of interest on the Series 2008 Bonds, and (vi) receipt of investment income, including interest on
the Series 2008 Bonds, may disqualify the recipient from obtaining the earned income credit under section
32(i) of the Code.
Bond Counsel has not undertaken to advise in the future whether any events after the date of
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds may affect the tax exempt status of interest on the Series 2008 Bonds or
the tax consequences of ownership of the Series 2008 Bonds. No assurance can be given that future
legislation, or amendments to the Code, if enacted into law, will not contain provisions which could directly
or indirectly reduce the benefit of the exclusion of the interest on the Series 2008 Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes.
In the opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Series 2008 Bonds is exempt from Massachusetts
personal income taxes and the Series 2008 Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property taxes.
Bond Counsel has not opined as to the other Massachusetts tax consequences resulting from holding the
Series 2008 Bonds. However, prospective purchasers should be aware that the Series 2008 Bonds are
included in the measure of Massachusetts estate and inheritance taxes, and the Series 2008 Bonds and the
interest thereon are included in the measure of Massachusetts corporate excise and franchise taxes. Bond
Counsel has not opined as to the taxability of the Series 2008 Bonds or the income therefrom under the laws
of any state other than Massachusetts.
26

Prospective purchasers should be aware that the statutory framework on which the exemption of
the Series 2008 Bonds from Massachusetts personal income taxes is based is similar to that at issue in
Davis v. Department of Revenue of Kentucky, 197 S.W. 3d 557 (Ky. App. 2006), oral argument heard by
the U.S. Supreme Court on November 5, 2007, in which the Kentucky court held that a statute which
provided more favorable income tax treatment for holders of bonds issued by Kentucky issuers than for
holders of out-of-state municipal bonds violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.
Should the United States Supreme Court affirm the holding of the Kentucky court, subsequent
Massachusetts judicial decisions and/or legislation designed to ensure the constitutionality of
Massachusetts tax law could, among other alternatives, adversely affect the Massachusetts tax exemption
of outstanding municipal obligations, including the Series 2008 Bonds, to the extent constitutionally
permissible, or result in the exemption from Massachusetts personal income taxes of interest on nonMassachusetts municipal obligations, either of which could affect the market price of the Series 2008
Bonds. Bond counsel has not opined as to the other Massachusetts tax consequences resulting from
holding the Series 2008 Bonds. Bond counsel has not opined as to the taxability of the Series 2008 Bonds
or the income therefrom under the laws of any state other than Massachusetts.
For federal income tax and Massachusetts personal income tax purposes, interest includes original
issue discount. Original issue discount with respect to a Series 2008 Bond is equal to the excess, if any, of
the stated redemption price at maturity of such Series 2008 Bond over the initial offering price thereof to the
public, excluding underwriters and other intermediaries, at which price a substantial amount of all Series
2008 Bonds with the same maturity and CUSIP designation were sold. Original issue discount accrues
actuarially over the term of a Series 2008 Bond. Holders should consult their own tax advisers with respect
to the computation of such accruals during the period in which any such Series 2008 Bond is held.
An amount equal to the excess, if any, of the purchase price of a Series 2008 Bond over the
principal amount payable at maturity constitutes amortizable bond premium for federal and Massachusetts
tax purposes. The required amortization of such premium during the term of a Series 2008 Bond will
result in reduction of the holder’s tax basis in such Series 2008 Bond. Such amortization also will result
in reduction of the amount of the stated interest on the Series 2008 Bond taken into account as interest for
tax purposes. Holders of Series 2008 Bonds purchased at a premium should consult their own tax
advisers with respect to the determination and treatment of such premium for federal income tax purposes
and with respect to state or local tax consequences of owning such Series 2008 Bonds.
CONTINUING DISCLOSURE
The Authority has agreed pursuant to a Continuing Disclosure Agreement between the Authority
and the Trustee to file certain annual financial information, which includes among other things, changes
in the Capital Fund Program materially affecting the timing or amount of receipt of Capital Funds by the
Authority, and updated versions of tables 2 and 3 in this Official Statement. In addition, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement will require the Authority to provide notices of the occurrence of certain events,
including, if material, the following:

3.

unscheduled draws on debt service reserves reflecting financial difficulties;

4.

unscheduled draws on credit enhancements reflecting financing difficulties;

LITIGATION
The Authority is involved in numerous lawsuits which arise out of the ordinary course of
operating public housing developments and related programs. Some of the cases pending against the
Authority involve claims for substantial moneys. As is true with any complex litigation, neither the
Authority nor its counsel is able to predict either the eventual outcome of such litigation or its impact on
the Authority’s finances.
However, upon delivery of the Series 2008 Bonds, the Authority will furnish a certificate to the
effect that, among other things, there is no litigation pending in any court seeking to restrain or enjoin the
issuance or delivery of the Series 2008 Bonds, or in any way contesting the validity or enforceability of
the Series 2008 Bonds or the Trust Estate or the pledge thereof.

LEGAL MATTERS
Certain legal matters incident to the authorization, issuance and sale of the Series 2008 Bonds are
subject to the approving legal opinion of Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo P.C., Bond
Counsel, who have been retained by, and act as Bond Counsel to, the Authority. Certain legal matters
will be passed upon for the Underwriters by their counsel, Hawkins Delafield & Wood LLP, Washington,
D.C.

28

LEGAL OPINIONS AND ENFORCEABILITY OF REMEDIES
The enforceability of the rights and remedies of the Trustee or the Owners of the Series 2008
Bonds under the Indenture are in many respects dependent upon judicial actions which are often subject
to discretion and delay. Under existing constitutional and statutory law and judicial decisions, the
enforceability of such rights and remedies under the Indenture may be limited.
The various legal opinions to be delivered concurrently with the delivery of the Series 2008
Bonds will be qualified as to the enforceability of the various legal instruments by limitations imposed by
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally,
and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).
MISCELLANEOUS
The references herein to the Act, the Indenture and the Continuing Disclosure Certificate are brief
summaries of certain provisions thereof. Such summaries do not purport to be complete and, for full and
complete statements of the provisions thereof, reference is made to the Act, the Indenture and the
Continuing Disclosure Certificate in their entirety. Copies of forms of such documents are on file at the
offices of the Underwriters during the offering period and, following delivery of the Series 2008 Bonds,

Price of Senior Obligations due (whether by maturity or redemption) or called for redemption on such
Bond Payment Date, and
(3) third, into the Project Fund the amount, if any, of any transfers made from the Project Fund
into the Revenue Fund to satisfy any deficiencies therein, from any remaining available Revenues until
the amount on deposit in the Project Fund has been replenished by the amount of such transfers.
Notwithstanding these provisions, no payments shall be required to be made into the Debt Service
Fund so long as the amount on deposit therein together with amounts on deposit in the Reserve Fund shall
be sufficient to pay the final maturing Outstanding Senior Obligations in accordance with their terms,
including the payment of any Sinking Fund Payments payable in connection therewith.
As soon as practicable after the sixtieth day preceding the due date of any Sinking Fund Payment,
the Trustee shall proceed to call for redemption pursuant to the Indenture, on such due date, Bonds of the

established, an amount equal to the principal amount of the Bonds so purchased or redeemed shall be
credited toward the next Sinking Fund Payment thereafter to become due. If, however, there shall be filed

Sinking Fund Payments upon any such purchase or redemption of Bonds, then such Sinking Fund
Payment shall be credited as shall be provided in such instructions.
Any earnings derived from the investment of amounts deposited with the Trustee pursuant to the
Indenture in connection with the issuance of Refunding Bonds shall, to the extent not required to provide

Fund Requirement with respect to the Series 2008 Bonds initially will be satisfied by delivery of a Debt
Reserve Credit Instrument by the Bond Insurer.
In the event there shall be on any Principal Payment Date or Interest Payment Date a deficiency
in the amounts in the Revenue Fund and the Debt Service Fund, to be applied to the payment of amounts
due on Senior Obligations, the Trustee shall make up such deficiency by transfer of moneys for that
purpose first from the Reserve Fund, and second, in the event there are insufficient moneys for such
purpose in the Reserve Fund, from the Project Fund.
Amounts on deposit in the Reserve Fund shall also be applied in conjunction with the final
payment of amounts due on the last Outstanding Senior Obligations. To the extent moneys on deposit in
the Reserve Fund exceed the Reserve Fund Requirement, the Authority shall direct the Trustee in writing
to transfer such excess to the Revenue Fund, except that any amount remaining in the Reserve Fund
which is in excess of the Reserve Fund Requirement after the Bonds of a Series have been retired may be
transferred to such other fund or account of the Authority as the Authorized Officer may direct in writing
for application in accordance with the Capital Fund Program, provided that no such transfer shall be made
until the Authority shall have filed with the Trustee (a) a supporting Cash Flow Statement and (b) a Bond
Counsel’s Opinion to the effect that such transfer will not adversely affect the exclusion of interest on the
Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
All or any part of the Reserve Fund Requirement may be met by deposit with the Trustee of a
Debt Reserve Credit Instrument. For purposes of the Indenture, a Debt Reserve Credit Instrument shall be
valued at the stated amount thereof. Any excess amounts in the Reserve Fund resulting from the deposit
of a Debt Reserve Credit Instrument into the Reserve Fund may be transferred to such other fund or
account of the Authority as the Authorized Officer may direct in writing for application in accordance
with the Capital Fund Program, provided that no such transfer shall be made until the Authority shall
have filed with the Trustee (a) a supporting Cash Flow Statement and (b) a Bond Counsel’s Opinion to
the effect that such transfer will not adversely affect the exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes.

above is withdrawn by the issuer thereof or expires and is not renewed, the Authority shall immediately
fund the resulting deficiency with respect to the Reserve Fund Requirement (a) by depositing in the
Reserve Fund a new Debt Reserve Credit Instrument meeting the requirements for Debt Reserve Credit
Instruments set forth above or (b) by funding the Reserve Fund from other available amounts as provided
above.
All earnings on the Reserve Fund shall be deposited into the Revenue Fund upon receipt.

Project Fund to the Program Expense Fund; and (2) any amounts transferred from the Revenue Fund
pursuant to the Indenture as described above under “Revenue Fund.”
A-16

Deposits. In order to permit such amounts to be available for use at the time when needed, any
amounts held in trust under the Indenture by any Fiduciary or Depositary as such, including amounts held
by the Trustee, may, if and as directed by the Authority, be deposited in the commercial banking
department of such Fiduciary or Depositary which may honor checks and drafts on such deposit with the
same force and effect as if it were not such Fiduciary or Depositary.
Investment of Certain Funds. The Authority shall direct the Trustee as to the investment of
amounts in the Accounts. The Authority shall direct the Trustee to invest and reinvest the moneys in any
Account in Investment Securities so that the maturity date or date of redemption at the option of the
holder thereof shall coincide as nearly as practicable, but in any case shall not extend beyond, the times at
which moneys are needed to be so expended. In the event that the Authority has not provided investment
direction to the Trustee, with respect to moneys held by the Trustee following the maturity of an
Investment Security, such maturing amounts shall, until such direction is provided, be invested by the
Trustee in a money market fund meeting the requirements of the Indenture and the Depository
Agreement. The Investment Securities purchased shall be held by the Trustee, or by such other
Depository as permitted by the Indenture, and shall be accounted for at all times as part of such Account,
and the Trustee, or such other Depository, shall keep the Authority advised as to the details of all such
investments. The foregoing notwithstanding, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Authority may
direct the Trustee to commingle moneys in the various Accounts for investment purposes and the Trustee
may transfer Investment Securities from Account to Account at the then current market value on the
books kept for such purpose without selling such Investment Securities.
Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, Investment Securities purchased as an investment
of moneys in any Account held by the Trustee under the provisions of the Indenture shall be deemed at all
times to be a part of such Account but the income or interest earned and gains realized in excess of losses
suffered by an Account due to the investment thereof shall be deposited in the Revenue Fund or shall be
credited as Revenues to the Revenue Fund and reinvested.
Valuation and Sale of Investments. In computing the amount in any Account, obligations
purchased as an investment of moneys therein shall be valued at their Value, as hereinafter defined, plus
accrued interest in each case. “Value,” which shall be determined for purposes of valuing the Investment
Securities in the Reserve Fund on each Principal Payment Date and for all other purposes as provided in
the Indenture or as provided or required in a Supplemental Indenture, means the value of any investments
calculated as follows:
(1) as to (i) certificates of deposit and banker’s acceptances, and (ii) as to any investment
not specified in (2) and (3) below: the par value or if purchased at other than par at the lesser of
cost or amortized value except as otherwise provided by a Supplemental Indenture;
(2) as to investments (other than those described in (1)(i)) the bid and asked prices of
which are published on a regular basis in The Wall Street Journal (or, if not there, then in The
New York Times): the average of the bid and asked prices for such investments so published on or
most recently prior to such time of determination;
(3) as to investments (other than those described in (1)(i) and (2)) the bid and asked
prices of which are not published on a regular basis in The Wall Street Journal or The New York
Times: the average bid price at such time of determination for such investments by any two
nationally recognized government securities dealers (selected by the Trustee in its absolute
discretion) at the time making a market in such investments or the bid price published by a
nationally recognized pricing service, if any; and

A-17

(4)
as to investments described in clauses (7) or (10) of the definition of “Investment
Securities,” the par value.
SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES
Supplemental Indentures Not Requiring the Consent of Owners of Bonds. A Supplemental
Indenture not requiring the consent of Owners of Bonds may be executed by the Authority and the
Trustee for one or more of the following purposes:
(1) to close the Indenture against, or provide limitations and restrictions in addition to the
limitations and restrictions contained in the Indenture on, the authentication and delivery of
additional Series of Bonds or the incurrence of other Senior Obligations;
(2) to add to the covenants and agreements of the Authority in the Indenture other
covenants and agreements to be observed by the Authority which are not contrary to or
inconsistent with the Indenture as theretofore in effect;
(3) to add to the limitations and restrictions in the Indenture other limitations and
restrictions to be observed by the Authority which are not contrary to or inconsistent with the
Indenture as theretofore in effect;
(4) to surrender any right, power or privilege reserved to or conferred upon the Authority
by the terms of the Indenture, but only if the surrender of such right, power or privilege is not
contrary to or inconsistent with the covenants and agreements of the Authority contained in the
Indenture;
(5) to confirm, as further assurance, any pledge under, and the subjection to any lien or
pledge created or to be created by, the Indenture of the Revenues or of any other revenues or
assets;
(6) to modify any of the provisions of the Indenture in any respect whatever, but only if
(i) such modification shall be, and be expressed to be, effective only after all Bonds Outstanding
at the date of the adoption of such Supplemental Indenture shall cease to be Outstanding, and
(ii) such Supplemental Indenture shall be specifically referred to in the text of all Bonds issued
after the date of the execution and delivery of such Supplemental Indenture;
(7) to authorize the issuance of one or more Series of Bonds, and to prescribe the terms
and conditions upon which such Bonds may be issued or incurred;
(8) to create additional special trust accounts for the further securing of all Bonds issued
pursuant to the Indenture if together with such Supplemental Indenture there is filed a Bond
Counsel’s Opinion to the effect that the creation and operation of such account will in no way
impair the existing security of the Holder of any Outstanding Senior Obligation;
(9) to cure any ambiguity, supply any omission, or cure or correct any defect or
inconsistent provisions in the Indenture;
(10) to provide for additional duties of the Trustee and other Fiduciaries;
(11) to satisfy the requirements of a Rating Agency in order to obtain, maintain or
improve the rating on any of the Bonds;

A-18

(12) to provide for the orderly sale or remarketing of Bonds;
(13) to make any other change which, in the judgment of the Trustee acting in reliance on
a Bond Counsel’s Opinion, is necessary or desirable to maintain the tax-exempt status of the
Bonds (other than Federally Taxable Bonds) and is not to the prejudice of the Trustee or Holders
of the Senior Obligations;
(14) to make any change which, in the judgment of the Trustee, is not materially adverse
to the interest of the Trustee or the Owners of Senior Obligations; or
(15) to make any change which has been submitted to and reviewed by each Rating
Agency and for which each Rating Agency shall have confirmed in writing that such change will
not itself result in the withdrawal or lowering of the rating on any Outstanding Bonds.
Supplemental Indentures Effective upon Consent of Owners of Bonds. At any time or from time to
time, a Supplemental Indenture may be executed by the Authority and the Trustee subject to consent by
Owners of Bonds. See “AMENDMENTS” below.
AMENDMENTS
Powers of Amendment. Except as provided in “SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES” above, any
modification of or amendment to the Indenture and of the rights and obligations of the Authority or the
Owner of any Senior Obligation, may be made by a Supplemental Indenture and in the event such
Supplemental Indenture shall be executed pursuant to the Indenture, with the written consent (i) of the
Owners of at least a majority in principal amount of the Bonds Outstanding at the time such consent is
given, (ii) of the Bond Insurers and HUD, (iii) in case less than all of the several Series of Bonds then
Outstanding are affected by the modification or amendment, of the Owners of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds of each Series so affected and Outstanding at the time such
consent is given, and (iv) in case the modification or amendment changes the terms of any Sinking Fund
Payment, of the Owners of 100% in principal amount of the Bonds of the particular Series and maturity
entitled to such Sinking Fund Payment and Outstanding at the time such consent is given.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no modification or amendment contained in any such supplemental
indenture shall permit any of the following, without the consent of each Bondholder whose rights are
affected thereby: (a) a change in the terms of stated maturity or redemption of any Bond or of any
installment of interest thereon; (b) a reduction in the principal amount of or redemption premium on any
Bond or in the rate of interest thereon or a change in the coin or currency in which such Bond is payable;
(c) the creation of a lien on or a pledge of any part of the Trust Estate, or the money or assets pledged
under the Indenture or any part thereof; (d) the granting of a preference or priority of any Bond or Bonds
over any other Bond or Bonds; (e) a reduction in the aggregate principal amount of Bonds of which the
consent of the Bondholders is required to effect any such modification or amendment; or (f) a change in
the provisions of the Indenture regarding waiver of defaults. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of
any Bond may extend the time for payment of the principal of or interest on such Bond; provided,
however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, funds available hereunder for the payment of
the principal and interest on the Bonds shall not be applied to any payment so extended until all principal
and interest payments which have not been extended have first been paid in full.
Consent of Owners of Bonds. (A) A copy of any Supplemental Indenture making a modification
or amendment which is not permitted under the provisions outlined in “SUPPLEMENTAL
INDENTURES” (or brief summary thereof or reference thereto in form approved by the Trustee),
together with a request to Owners of Bonds for their consent thereto in form satisfactory to the Trustee,
shall be mailed by the Registrar on behalf of the Authority to the Owners of Bonds to be affected by such
A-19

proposed amendment or modification. Such Supplemental Indenture shall not be effective unless and until
(i) there shall have been filed with the Trustee (a) the written consents of Owners of the percentages of
Outstanding Bonds as specified in the preceding paragraph and (b) a Bond Counsel’s Opinion stating that
such Supplemental Indenture has been duly and lawfully approved by the Authority in accordance with
the provisions of the Indenture, is authorized or permitted thereby and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, is valid and binding upon the Authority, and (ii) a
notice shall have been delivered as to the execution of such Supplemental Indenture.
(B)
The consent of an Owner of a Bond to any modification or amendment shall be effective
only if accompanied by proof of the holding, at the date of such consent, of the Bonds with respect to
which such consent is given, which proof shall be such as is permitted by the Indenture. Any such consent
shall be binding upon the Owner of the Bonds giving such consent and upon any subsequent Owner of
such Bonds and of any Bonds issued in exchange therefor (whether or not such subsequent Owner thereof
has notice thereof) unless such consent is revoked in writing by the Owner of such Bonds giving such
consent or a subsequent Owner thereof by filing with the Trustee at least three (3) Business Days, prior to
the time when the consents are deemed conclusive in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, such
revocation and, if such Bonds are transferable by delivery, proof that such Bonds are held by the signer of
such revocation in the manner permitted by the Indenture.
Modifications by Unanimous Consent. The terms and provisions of the Indenture and the rights
and obligations of the Authority and of the Owners of the Bonds thereunder may be modified or amended
in any respect upon the execution by the Authority and the Trustee of a Supplemental Indenture and the
consent of the Owners of all the Bonds then Outstanding, such consent to be given as provided in the
Indenture, but no such modification or amendment shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations
of any Fiduciary without the filing with the Trustee of the written assent thereto of such Fiduciary in
addition to the consent of the Bondholders. No notice of any such modification, amendment, assent or
publication thereof shall be required.
DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES
Events of Default. (A) Each of the following events is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:
(1) payment of the principal of or Redemption Price, if any, on any Bond when and as the
same shall become due, whether at maturity or upon call for redemption or otherwise, shall not be
made when and as the same becomes due;
(2) payment of any installment of interest on any of the Bonds shall not be made when
and as the same shall become due;
(3) if bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings, or
other proceedings for relief under any bankruptcy law or similar law for the relief of debtors are
instituted by the Authority (other than (i) such proceedings instituted by the Authority against
other parties and (ii) the Authority being placed into a management receivership sought or
imposed by or in cooperation with HUD);
(4) the Authority shall fail or refuse to comply with the provisions of the Indenture, or
shall default in the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or conditions
on its part contained in the Indenture or in any Supplemental Indenture or the Bonds, and such
failure, refusal or default shall continue for a period of forty-five (45) days after written notice
thereof by the Trustee, the Bond Insurer or the Owners of not less than 25% in principal amount
of the Outstanding Bonds; provided that the Trustee or such Owners of not less than 25% in
A-20

principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds shall not provide written notice to the Authority of
any such failure, refusal or default until and after the Trustee has complied with the provisions of
subsection (B) below; or
(5) with respect to any Series of Bonds, the occurrence of any Event of Default pursuant
to the Supplemental Indenture authorizing such Series.
(B)
The Trustee shall not give the written notice referred to in subsection (4) above unless or
until (i) the Authority has been advised by the Trustee that the Trustee believes that a reasonable basis
exists to issue such written notice; (ii) a period of ten (10) Business Days has expired after receipt by the
Authority of such advice, during which period the Authority shall have the opportunity to contest the
basis for such written notice; and (iii) the Trustee has provided the Authority with written confirmation
that the Trustee disagrees with the Authority’s position on the matter in question.
Remedies. Upon the happening and continuance of any Event of Default specified in
subsections (1), (2) and (3) above, the Trustee shall promptly notify the Authority and each Fiduciary of
the existence of such Event of Default and shall proceed, or upon the happening and continuance of any
Event of Default specified in subsections (4) and (5) above, the Trustee shall promptly notify the
Authority and each Fiduciary of the existence of such Event of Default and may proceed (and, upon the
written request of the Owners of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds, shall
proceed) in its own name, subject to the provisions of the Indenture, to protect and enforce the rights of
the Owners of the Senior Obligations by such of the following remedies, as the Trustee, being advised by
counsel, shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce such rights:
(1) by mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity, to enforce all
rights of the Owners of Senior Obligations, including the right to require the Authority to carry
out the covenants and agreements contained in the Indenture, and to require the Authority to carry
out any other covenants or agreements with Owners of Senior Obligations and to perform its
duties as prescribed by law;
(2) by bringing suit upon the Senior Obligations;
(3) by action or suit in equity, to require the Authority to account as if it were the trustee
of an express trust for the Owners of Senior Obligations; or
(4) by action or suit in equity to enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or in
violation of the rights of the Owners of Senior Obligations.
At any time after such a declaration of an Event of Default has been made and before the entry of
a judgment or decree for payment of the money due, the Trustee shall proceed to rescind and annul such
declaration and its consequences if:
(1)
there has been paid to or deposited with the Trustee by or for the account of the
Authority, or provision satisfactory to the Trustee has been made for the payment of a sum
sufficient to pay: (A) all overdue installments of interest on the Bonds; (B) the principal of, and
redemption premium, if any, on any Bonds which have become due; (C) to the extent lawful,
interest upon overdue installments of interest and redemption premium, if any; and (D) all sums
paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder, together with the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel prior to the date of notice of
rescission; and

A-21

(2)

all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

No such rescission and annulment shall affect any subsequent default or impair any consequent
right.
In the enforcement of any rights and remedies under the Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to
sue for, enforce payment of and receive any and all amounts then or during any default becoming, and at
any time remaining, due and unpaid from the Authority for principal, interest or otherwise, under any
provisions of the Indenture or a Supplemental Indenture or of the Senior Obligations, with, to the extent
permitted by law, interest on overdue payments at the rate of interest specified in such Senior Obligations,
together with any and all costs and expenses of collection and of all proceedings thereunder and under
such Senior Obligations, without prejudice to any other right or remedy of the Trustee or of the Owners of
Senior Obligations, and to recover and enforce a judgment or decree against the Authority for any portion
of such amounts remaining unpaid, with interest, costs and expenses (including without limitation
pretrial, trial and appellate attorney fees), and to collect from the Authority any moneys adjudged or
decreed to be payable.
Priority of Payments After Default. In the event that upon the happening and continuance of any
Event of Default the funds held by the Trustee and Paying Agents shall be insufficient for the payment of
principal or Redemption Price and interest then due on the Senior Obligations, such funds (other than
funds held for the payment of particular Senior Obligations which have theretofore become due at
maturity) and any other amounts received by the Trustee acting pursuant to the Indenture, after providing
for the payment of any expenses necessary in the opinion of the Trustee to protect the interest of the
Owners of Senior Obligations and for the payment of the fees, charges, expenses and liabilities incurred
and advances made by the Trustee or any Paying Agents in the performance of their respective duties
under the Indenture, shall be applied as follows:
(1) Unless the principal of all of the Senior Obligations shall have become due and
payable:
FIRST: To the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of interest then
due on Senior Obligations in the order of the maturity of such installments, and, if the amount
available shall not be sufficient to pay in full any installment, then to the payment thereof ratably,
according to the amounts due on such installment, to the persons entitled thereto, without any
discrimination or preference; and
SECOND: To the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal or
Redemption Price of any Senior Obligations which shall have become due, with interest upon
such principal or Redemption Price at the interest rate set forth in such Senior Obligations from
the respective dates upon which they shall have become due and payable, and, if the amounts
available shall not be sufficient to pay in full all the Senior Obligations due, together with such
interest, then to the payment, first of such interest ratably, according to the amounts of principal
or Redemption Price due on such date, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination
or preference.
(2) If the principal of all of the Senior Obligations shall have become due and payable, to
the payment of the principal and interest then due and unpaid upon the Senior Obligations
without preference of priority of principal over interest or of interest over principal, or of any
installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Senior Obligation over any
other Senior Obligation, ratably, according to the amounts due respectively for principal and

A-22

interest, to the persons entitled thereto without any discrimination or preference except as to any
difference in the respective rates of interest specified in the Senior Obligations; and
Whenever moneys are to be applied by the Trustee as described above, such moneys shall be
applied by the Trustee at such times, and from time to time, as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall
determine, having due regard to the amount of such moneys available for application and the likelihood of
additional money becoming available for such application in the future. The deposit of such moneys with
the Paying Agents, or otherwise setting aside such moneys in trust for the proper purpose, shall constitute
proper application by the Trustee, and the Trustee shall incur no liability whatsoever to the Authority, to
any Owner of a Senior Obligation or to any other person for any delay in applying any such moneys, so
long as the Trustee acts with reasonable diligence, having due regard for the circumstances, and
ultimately applies the same in accordance with such provisions of the Indenture as may be applicable at
the time of application by the Trustee. Whenever the Trustee shall exercise such discretion in applying
such moneys, it shall fix the date (which shall be an Interest Payment Date unless the Trustee shall deem
another date more suitable) upon which such application is to be made and upon such date interest on the
amounts of principal to be paid on such date shall cease to accrue. The Trustee shall give such notice as it
may deem appropriate for the fixing of any such date. The Trustee shall not be required to make payment
to an Owner of a Bond any unpaid amount relating to such Bond unless such Bond shall be presented to
the Trustee for appropriate endorsement or for cancellation if fully paid.
Owners of Bonds’ Direction of Proceedings. Anything in the Indenture to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Owners of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding,
shall have the right, by an instrument or concurrent instruments in writing executed and delivered to the
Trustee, to direct the method of conducting all remedial proceedings to be taken by the Trustee under the
Indenture, provided that such direction shall not be otherwise than in accordance with law or the
provisions of the Indenture, and that the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow such direction
which in the opinion of the Trustee would be unjustly prejudicial to Owners of Bonds not parties to such
direction.
Limitation on Rights of Owners of Bonds. (A) Except as otherwise specifically provided by the
Indenture, no Bondholder shall have any right to institute any suit, action, mandamus or other proceeding
in equity or at law hereunder, or for the protection or enforcement of any right under the Indenture unless
such person is an Owner of one or more Bonds then Outstanding, and (1) an Event of Default shall have
occurred and is continuing; (2) such Owner previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of
the Event of Default or breach of duty on account of which such suit, action or proceeding is to be taken,
(3) the Owners of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding, shall have made
written request of the Trustee after the right to exercise such powers of right of action, as the case may be,
shall have occurred, and shall have afforded the Trustee a reasonable opportunity either to proceed to
exercise the powers herein granted or granted under the law or to institute such action, suit or proceeding
in its name, (4) there shall have been offered to the Trustee reasonable security and indemnity against the
fees, costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, (5) the Trustee shall have refused or
neglected to comply with such request within sixty (60) days after its receipt of such written request and
offer of indemnity and (6) no direction inconsistent with such request has been given to the Trustee
during such 60-day period by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then
Outstanding; and such notification request and offer of indemnity are hereby declared in every such case,
at the option of the Trustee, to be conditions precedent to the execution of the powers under the Indenture
or for any other remedy hereunder or by law. It is understood and intended that, except as otherwise
above provided, no one or more Owners of Bonds hereby secured shall have any right in any manner
whatever by its or their action to affect, disturb or prejudice the security of the Indenture, or to enforce
any right hereunder, except in the manner herein provided, and that all proceedings at law or in equity
shall be instituted, had and maintained in the manner herein provided and for the benefit of all Owners of
A-23

Bonds. Nothing contained in this Article X shall affect or impair the absolute and unconditional right of
any Owner of a Bond to receive payment of principal of, redemption premium, if any, and interest on the
Bonds on and after the due date thereof, and to enforce the payment of the principal of and interest on its
Bonds, or the obligation of the Authority to pay the principal of and interest on each Bond issued or
incurred hereunder, to the Owner thereof at the time and place in said Bond expressed.
Anything to the contrary notwithstanding contained in the Indenture, each Owner of a Bond by its
acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed that any court in its discretion may require, in any suit
for the enforcement of any right or remedy under the Indenture or any Supplemental Indenture, or in any
suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in
such suit of an undertaking to pay the reasonable costs of such suit, and that such court may in its
discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable pretrial, trial and appellate attorneys’ fees, against
any party litigant in any such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses
made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any suit instituted by
the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Bondholder, or group of Bondholders, holding at least 25% in
principal amount of the Bonds Outstanding, or to any suit instituted by any Owner of a Bond for the
enforcement of the payment of any Bond on or after the respective due date thereof expressed in such
Bond.
Remedies Not Exclusive. No remedy in the Indenture conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or
to the Owners of Bonds is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies, and each and every
such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy given thereunder or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.
Notice of Event of Default. The Trustee shall give to the Owners of Bonds notice of each Event of
Default under the Indenture known by a trust officer in the corporate trust department of the Trustee who
is responsible for the administration of the Indenture within ninety (90) days after actual knowledge of the
occurrence thereof, unless such Event of Default shall have been remedied or cured before the giving of
such notice; provided, that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of, Redemption
Price or interest on any of the Bonds, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so
long as the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the
Owners of Bonds. Each such notice of Event of Default shall be given by the Trustee by mailing written
notice thereof: (i) to all Owners of Bonds, as the names and addresses of such Owners appear upon the
books for registration and transfer of Bonds as kept by the Trustee, and (ii) to such other persons as is
required by law.
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indenture to the contrary, but subject to the provisions
of any applicable Supplemental Indenture, until the Authority has reimbursed a Credit Facility Provider
for amounts paid under a Credit Facility to pay the interest on or the principal or purchase price of any
Bonds on any Bond Payment Date, or to the extent any Bond Insurer has exercised its rights as subrogee
for the particular Bonds of which it has insured payment, (i) such Bonds shall be deemed to be
Outstanding and such Credit Facility Provider or Bond Insurer shall succeed to the rights and interests of
the Owners to the extent of the amounts paid under the Credit Facility or as specified in respect of the
applicable Bond Insurance Policy until such amount has been reimbursed, and (ii) upon presentation to
the Registrar, such Bonds shall be registered in the name of the Credit Facility Provider or its nominee or
such Bond Insurer or its nominee, as appropriate.
DEFEASANCE
Defeasance. (A) If the Authority shall pay or cause to be paid to the Owners of the Bonds, the
principal, premium, if any, purchase price and interest to become due thereon, at the times and in the
A-24

manner stipulated therein and in the Indenture, and pay or cause to be paid (i) to each Fiduciary its fees,
costs and expenses, (ii) to each Credit Facility Provider all amounts owing under each Credit Facility or
agreements relating thereto, (iii) to each Bond Insurer all amounts owing under each Bond insurance
Policy, and (iv) to each remarketing agent all amounts owing under each remarketing agreement, then the
pledge of the Trust Estate, including any Revenues and other moneys, securities, funds and property
pledged pursuant to the Indenture and all other rights granted by the Indenture shall be discharged and
satisfied.
If the Authority shall pay or cause to be paid, or there shall otherwise be paid, to the Owners of
all Outstanding Bonds of a particular Series the principal, purchase price and interest due or to become
due thereon, at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and in the Indenture, and pay or cause to be
paid (i) to each Fiduciary its fees, costs and expenses relating to such Bonds, (ii) to each Credit Facility
Provider relating to such Bonds all amounts owing under each Credit Facility or agreements relating
thereto, (iii) to each Bond Insurer all amounts owing under each Bond Insurance Policy, and (iv) to each
remarketing agent relating to such Bonds all amounts owing under each remarketing agreement thereto,
such Bonds and related Senior Obligations shall cease to be entitled to any lien, benefit or security under
the Indenture and all covenants, agreements and obligations of the Authority to the Owners of such Bonds
and related Senior Obligations shall thereupon cease, terminate and become void and be discharged and
satisfied.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and paragraph (B) below, the provisions of the Indenture relating
to payment, registration, transfer and redemption of Bonds shall remain in effect until final maturity or the
Redemption Date of the Bonds.
(B)
Bonds (other than Bonds held in custody for the benefit of a Credit Facility Provider
under a Supplemental Indenture) or interest installments (other than on Bonds held in custody for the
benefit of a Credit Facility Provider under a Supplemental Indenture) for the payment of which moneys
shall have been set aside and shall be held in trust by the Fiduciaries (through deposit by the Authority of
funds for such payment or otherwise) shall, at the maturity or Redemption Date thereof, be deemed to
have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in subsection (A) above. Except as
otherwise provided in any Supplemental Indenture, all Bonds shall, prior to the maturity or Redemption
Date thereof, be deemed to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in
subsection (A) above if (i) in case any of said Bonds are to be redeemed on any date prior to their
maturity, the Authority shall have given to the Trustee in form satisfactory to it irrevocable instructions to
mail as provided in the Indenture notice of redemption on said date of such Bonds, accompanied by the
consent of HUD, (ii) there shall have been deposited with the Trustee either moneys in an amount which
shall be sufficient, and/or noncallable Defeasance Obligations the principal of and the interest on which
when due will provide moneys which, together with the moneys, if any, deposited with the Trustee at the
same time, shall be sufficient to pay when due the principal or Redemption Price, if any, of and interest
due and to become due on said Bonds on and prior to the Redemption Date or maturity date thereof, as
the case may be, and (iii) in the event said Bonds are not by their terms subject to redemption within the
next succeeding sixty (60) days, the Authority shall have given the Trustee in form satisfactory to it
irrevocable instructions to mail, as soon as practicable, a notice to the Owners of such Bonds that the
deposit required by (ii) above has been made with the Trustee and that said Bonds are deemed to have
been paid in accordance with the Indenture and stating such maturity or Redemption Date upon which
moneys are to be available for the payment of the principal or Redemption Price, if any, on said Bonds.
(C)
The deposit required by subsection (B) above may be made with respect to Bonds within
any particular maturity, in which case such maturity of Bonds shall no longer be deemed to be
Outstanding under the terms of the Indenture, and the Owners of such defeased Bonds shall be secured

A-25

only by such trust funds and not by any other part of the Trust Estate, and the Indenture shall remain in
full force and effect to protect the interests of the Owners of Bonds remaining Outstanding thereafter.
(D)
The Authority may, in its sole discretion, in connection with the defeasance to maturity of
Bonds, reserve the right at such time of defeasance to provide that such Bonds shall remain subject to
redemption prior to maturity in accordance with their terms.
FEDERAL PUBLIC HOUSING REQUIREMENTS CONTROL
To the extent that any provision of the Indenture is in conflict with the requirements of the
United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, (“Federal public housing requirements”), such Federal
public housing requirements shall control and govern in such instances of conflict.
BOND INSURANCE PROVISIONS
While the Bond Insurance Policy provided by the Bond Insurer is insuring the Series 2008 Bonds,
the following provisions shall apply:
(a) The Bond Insurer shall be deemed to be the sole holder of the Series 2008 Bonds for the
purpose of exercising any voting right or privilege or giving any consent or direction or taking any other
action that the holders of the Series 2008 Bonds insured by it are entitled to take pursuant the article of the
Master Indenture pertaining to defaults and remedies and the article of the Indenture pertaining to the
duties and obligations of the Trustee, if any;
(b) No Additional Bonds bearing interest at a variable rate shall be issued without the prior
written consent of the Bond Insurer;
(c) All Cash Flow Statements issued under the Indenture shall be approved by the Bond Insurer;
(d) The maturity of Series 2008 Bonds shall not be accelerated without the consent of the Bond
Insurer. In the event the maturity of the Series 2008 Bonds is accelerated, the Bond Insurer may elect, in
its sole discretion, to pay accelerated principal and interest accrued, on such principal to the date of
acceleration (to the extent unpaid by the Authority) and the Trustee shall be required to accept such
amounts. Upon payment of such accelerated principal and interest accrued to the acceleration date as
provided above, the Bond Insurer’s obligations under the Bond Insurance Policy with respect to such
Series 2008 Bonds shall be fully discharged;
(e) No grace period for a covenant default shall exceed 30 days or be extended for more than 60
days, without the prior written consent of the Bond Insurer. No grace period shall be permitted for
payment defaults;
(f) Upon the occurrence of an extraordinary optional, special or extraordinary mandatory
redemption in part, the selection of Series 2008 Bonds to be redeemed shall be subject to the approval of
the Bond Insurer. The exercise of any provision of the Indenture which permits the purchase of Series
2008 Bonds in lieu of redemption shall require the prior written approval of the Bond Insurer if any Series
2008 Bond so purchased is not cancelled upon purchase;
(g) Any amendment, supplement, modification to, or waiver of, the Indenture or any other
transaction document, including any underlying security agreement (each a “Related Document”), that
requires the consent of Bondowners or adversely affects the rights and interests of the Bond Insurer shall
be subject to the prior written consent of the Bond Insurer;

A-26

(h) Unless the Bond Insurer otherwise directs, upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event
of Default or an event which with notice or lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default, amounts
on deposit in the Project Fund shall not be disbursed, but shall instead be applied to the payment of debt
service or redemption price of the Series 2008 Bonds;
(i) The rights granted to the Bond Insurer under the Master Indenture or any other related
document to request, consent to or direct any action are rights granted to the Bond Insurer in
consideration of its issuance of the Bond Insurance Policy. Any exercise by the Bond Insurer of such
rights is merely an exercise of the Bond Insurer’s contractual rights and shall not be construed or deemed
to be taken for the benefit or on behalf of the Bondholders nor does such action evidence any position of
the Bond Insurer, positive or negative, as to whether Bondholder consent is required in addition to
consent of the Bond Insurer;
(j) Only (1) cash, (2) non-callable direct obligations of the United States of America
(“Treasuries”), (3) evidences of ownership of proportionate interests in future interest and principal
payments on Treasuries held by a bank or trust company as custodian, under which the owner of the
investment is the real party in interest and has the right to proceed directly and individually against the
obligor and the underlying Treasuries are not available to any person claiming through the custodian or to
whom the custodian may be obligated, (4) subject to the prior written consent of the Bond Insurer,
prerefunded municipal obligations rated “AAA” and “Aaa” by S&P and Moody’s, respectively or (5)
subject to the prior written consent of the Bond Insurer, securities eligible for “AAA” defeasance under
then existing criteria of S&P or any combination thereof, shall be authorized to be used to effect
defeasance of the Series 2008 Bonds unless the Bond Insurer otherwise approves; To accomplish
defeasance of the Series 2008 Bonds, the Authority shall cause to be delivered (i) a report of an
independent firm of nationally recognized certified public accountants or such other accountant as shall
be acceptable to the Bond Insurer (“Accountant”) verifying the sufficiency of the escrow established to
pay the Series 2008 Bonds in full on the maturity or redemption date (“Verification”), (ii) an Escrow
Deposit Agreement (which shall be acceptable in form and substance to the Bond Insurer), (iii) an opinion
of nationally recognized bond counsel to the effect that the Series 2008 Bonds are no longer Outstanding
under the Indenture and (iv) if there is a Trustee for the Series 2008 Bonds, a certificate of discharge of
the Trustee with respect to the Series 2008 Bonds; each Verification and defeasance opinion shall be
acceptable in form and substance, and addressed, to the Agency, the Trustee and the Bond Insurer. The
Bond Insurer shall be provided with final drafts of the above-referenced documentation not less than five
business days prior to the funding of the escrow; The Series 2008 Bonds shall be deemed Outstanding
under the Master Indenture unless and until they are in fact paid and retired or the above criteria are met.
(k) Amounts paid by the Bond Insurer under the Insurance Policy shall not be deemed paid for
purposes of the Master Indenture and shall remain Outstanding and continue to be due and owing until
paid by the Authority in accordance with the Indenture. The Master Indenture shall not be discharged
unless all amounts due or to become due to the Bond Insurer have been paid in full or duly provided for;
(l) The Authority and the Trustee covenant and agree to take such action (including, as
applicable, filing of UCC financing statements and continuations thereof) as is necessary from time to
time to perfect or otherwise preserve the priority of the pledge of Trust Estate under applicable law;
(m) If, on the third Business Day prior to the related scheduled interest payment date or principal
payment date (“Payment Date”) there is not on deposit with the Trustee, after making all transfers and
deposits required under the Master Indenture, moneys sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the
Series 2008 Bonds due on such Payment Date, the Trustee shall give notice to the Bond Insurer and to its
designated agent (if any) (the “Bond Insurer’s Fiscal Agent”) by telephone or telecopy of the amount of
such deficiency by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on such Business Day. If, on the second Business
A-27

Day prior to the related Payment Date, there continues to be a deficiency in the amount available to pay
the principal of and interest on the Series 2008 Bonds due on such Payment Date, the Trustee shall make
a claim under the Insurance Policy and give notice to the Bond Insurer and the Bond Insurer’s Fiscal
Agent (if any) by telephone of the amount of such deficiency, and the allocation of such deficiency
between the amount required to pay interest on the Series 2008 Bonds and the amount required to pay
principal of the Series 2008 Bonds, confirmed in writing to the Bond Insurer and the Bond Insurer’s
Fiscal Agent by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on such second Business Day by filling in the form of
Notice of Claim and Certificate delivered with the Insurance Policy; The Trustee shall designate any
portion of payment of principal on Series 2008 Bonds paid by the Bond Insurer, whether by virtue of
mandatory sinking fund redemption, maturity or other advancement of maturity, on its books as a
reduction in the principal amount of Series 2008 Bonds registered to the then current Bondholder,
whether DTC or its nominee or otherwise, and shall issue a replacement Bond to the Bond Insurer,
registered in the name of the Bond Insurer, in a principal amount equal to the amount of principal so paid
(without regard to authorized denominations); provided that the Trustee’s failure to so designate any
payment or issue any replacement Series 2008 Bond shall have no effect on the amount of principal or
interest payable by the Authority on any Series 2008 Bond or the subrogation rights of the Bond Insurer;
The Trustee shall keep a complete and accurate record of all funds deposited by the Bond Insurer into the
Policy Payments Account (defined below) and the allocation of such funds to payment of interest on and
principal paid in respect of any Series 2008 Bond. The Bond Insurer shall have the right to inspect such
records at reasonable times upon reasonable notice to the Trustee; Upon payment of a claim under the
Insurance Policy, the Trustee shall establish a separate special purpose trust account for the benefit of
Bondholders (the “Policy Payments Account”) and over which the Trustee shall have exclusive control
and sole right of withdrawal. The Trustee shall receive any amount paid under the Insurance Policy in
trust on behalf of Bondholders and shall deposit any such amount in the Policy Payments Account and
distribute such amount only for purposes of making the payments for which a claim was made. Such
amounts shall be disbursed by the Trustee to Bondholders in the same manner as principal and interest
payments are to be made with respect to the Series 2008 Bonds under the sections of the Indenture
regarding payment of Series 2008 Bonds. It shall not be necessary for such payments to be made by
checks or wire transfers separate from the check or wire transfer used to pay debt service with other funds
available to make such payments; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary otherwise set forth in the
Indenture, and to the extent permitted by law, the Authority agrees to pay to the Bond Insurer (i) a sum
equal to the total of all amounts paid by the Bond Insurer under the Bond Insurance Policy (the “Insurer
Advances”); and (ii) interest on such Insurer Advances from the date paid by the Bond Insurer until
payment thereof in full, payable to the Bond Insurer at the Late Payment Rate per annum (collectively,
the “Insurer Reimbursement Amounts”). “Late Payment Rate” means the lesser of (a) the greater of (i) the
per annum rate of interest, publicly announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank at its principal
office in The City of New York, as its prime or base lending rate (any change in such rate of interest to be
effective on the date such change is announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank) plus 3%, and (ii) the then
applicable highest rate of interest on the Series 2008 Bonds and (b) the maximum rate permissible under
applicable usury or similar laws limiting interest rates. The Late Payment Rate shall be computed on the
basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days. The Authority hereby covenants and
agrees that the Insurer Reimbursement Amounts are secured by a lien on and pledge of the Trust Estate
and payable from such Trust Estate on a parity with debt service due on the Series 2008 Bonds; Funds
held in the Policy Payments Account shall not be invested by the Trustee and may not be applied to
satisfy any costs, expenses or liabilities of the Trustee. Any funds remaining in the Policy Payments
Account following a Bond payment date shall promptly be remitted to the Bond Insurer;
(n) The Bond Insurer shall, to the extent it makes any payment of principal of or interest on the
Series 2008 Bonds, become subrogated to the rights of the recipients of such payments in accordance with
the terms of the Insurance Policy. The obligations to the Bond Insurer shall survive discharge or
termination of the Related Documents;
A-28

(o) The Authority shall pay or reimburse the Bond Insurer any and all charges, fees, costs and
expenses that the Bond Insurer may reasonably pay or incur in connection with (i) the administration,
enforcement, defense or preservation of any rights or security in any Related Document; (ii) the pursuit of
any remedies under the Indenture or any other Related Document or otherwise afforded by law or equity,
(iii) any amendment, waiver or other action with respect to, or related to, the Indenture or any other
Related Document whether or not executed or completed, or (iv) any litigation or other dispute in
connection with the Indenture or any other Related Document or the transactions contemplated thereby,
other than costs resulting from the failure of the Bond Insurer to honor its obligations under the Insurance
Policy. The Bond Insurer reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee as a condition to executing any
amendment, waiver or consent proposed in respect of the Indenture or any other Related Document;
(p) After payment of reasonable expenses of the Trustee, the application of funds realized upon
default shall be applied to the payment of expenses of the Authority or rebate only after the payment of
past due and current debt service on the Series 2008 Bonds and amounts required to restore the Reserve
Fund to the Reserve Fund Requirement;
(q) The Bond Insurer shall be entitled to pay principal or interest on the Series 2008 Bonds that
shall become Due for Payment but shall be unpaid by reason of Nonpayment by the Authority (as such
terms are defined in the Insurance Policy) and any amounts due on the Series 2008 Bonds as a result of
acceleration of the maturity thereof in accordance with the Indenture, whether or not the Bond Insurer has
received a Notice of Nonpayment (as such terms are defined in the Bond Insurance Policy) or a claim
upon the Bond Insurance Policy;
(r) The notice address of the Bond Insurer shall be: Financial Security Assurance Inc., 31 West
52nd Street, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Managing Director – Surveillance, Re: Policy No. ,
Telephone: (212) 826-0100; Telecopier: (212) 339-3556. In each case in which notice or other
communication refers to an Event of Default, then a copy of such notice or other communication shall
also be sent to the attention of the General Counsel and shall be marked to indicate “URGENT
MATERIAL ENCLOSED;”
(s) The Bond Insurer shall be provided with the following information by the Authority or
Trustee, as the case may be:
(i) Annual audited financial statements within 150 days after the end of the Authority’s
fiscal year (together with a certification of the Authority that it is not aware of any default or Event of
Default under the Indenture), and the Authority’s annual budget within 30 days after the approval thereof
together with such other information, data or reports as the Bond Insurer shall reasonably request from
time to time;
(ii) Notice of any draw upon the Reserve Fund within two Business Days after
knowledge thereof other than (i) withdrawals of amounts in excess of the Reserve Fund Requirement and
(ii) withdrawals in connection with a refunding of Series 2008 Bonds;
(iii) Notice of any default known to the Trustee or Authority within five Business Days
after knowledge thereof;
(iv) Prior notice of the advance refunding or redemption of any of the Series 2008 Bonds,
including the principal amount, maturities and CUSIP numbers thereof;

A-29

(v) Notice of the resignation or removal of the Trustee and Bond Registrar and the
appointment of, and acceptance of duties by, any successor thereto;
(vi) Notice of the commencement of any proceeding by or against the Authority
commenced under the United States Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership, rehabilitation or similar law (an “Insolvency Proceeding”);
(vii) Notice of the making of any claim in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding
seeking the avoidance as a preferential transfer of any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Series
2008 Bonds;
(viii) A full original transcript of all proceedings relating to the execution of any
amendment, supplement, or waiver to the Related Documents; and
(ix) All reports, notices and correspondence to be delivered to Bondholders under the
terms of the Related Documents;
(t) Notwithstanding satisfaction of the other conditions to the issuance of Additional Bonds set
forth in the Indenture, no such issuance may occur without the prior approval of the Bond Insurer (1) if an
Event of Default (or any event which, once all notice or grace periods have passed, would constitute an
Event of Default) exists unless such default shall be cured upon such issuance and (2) unless the Reserve
Fund is fully funded at the Reserve Fund Requirement upon the issuance of such Additional Bonds, in
either case unless otherwise permitted by the Bond Insurer;
(u) In determining whether any amendment, consent, waiver or other action to be taken, or any
failure to take action, under the Indenture would adversely affect the security for the Series 2008 Bonds or
the rights of the Bondholders, the Trustee shall consider the effect of any such amendment, consent,
waiver, action or inaction as if there were no Insurance Policy; and
(v) No contract shall be entered into or any action taken by which the rights of the Bond Insurer
or security for or sources of payment of the Series 2008 Bonds may be impaired or prejudiced in any
material respect except upon obtaining the prior written consent of the Bond Insurer.
(w) The Authority shall provide to the Bond Insurer (i) copies of each of its Annual Plan and the
Five Year Plan the Authority is required to submit to HUD and (ii) an annual certification evidencing that
the Authority’s existing property and casualty insurance coverage is for the full replacement value of its
housing units for which it receives grants under the Annual Contributions Contract with HUD (such units
“ACC Units”) and otherwise complies with the requirements of the Indenture, which certificate shall be
from a provider rated at least A- by A.M. Best (unless otherwise agreed by the Bond Insurer).
(x) The Authority shall certify on an annual basis the number of ACC Units anticipated to be
eligible for Capital Fund Allocations in each year through the maturity date of the Bonds and shall
covenant not to reduce the number of ACC Units below 80% of the number of Units assumed to be in
existence at the time of closing without either (i) confirmation that the unenhanced ratings on the Bonds
of each rating agency then rating the Bonds will not be reduced or (ii) the prior written consent of the
Bond Insurer.
(y) The prior written consent of the Insurer shall be a condition precedent to the deposit of any
credit instrument provided in lieu of a cash deposit into the Debt Service Reserve Fund.

A-30

(z) The Authority must receive FSA’s prior written consent if Replacement Housing Factor Funds
will secure Additional Bonds.
(aa) The Authority shall repay any draws under the Reserve Policy and pay all related reasonable
expenses incurred by the Bond Insurer. Interest shall accrue and be payable on such draws and expenses
from the date of payment by the Bond Insurer at the Late Payment Rate. “Late Payment Rate” means the
lesser of (a) the greater of (i) the per annum rate of interest, publicly announced from time to time by
JPMorgan Chase Bank at its principal office in the City of New York, as its prime or base lending rate
(“Prime Rate”) (any change in such Prime Rate to be effective on the date such change is announced by
JPMorgan Chase Bank) plus 3%, and (ii) the then applicable highest rate of interest on the Bonds and (b)
the maximum rate permissible under applicable usury or similar laws limiting interest rates. The Late
Payment Rate shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360
days. In the event JPMorgan Chase Bank ceases to announce its Prime Rate publicly, Prime Rate shall be
the publicly announced prime or base lending rate of such national bank as the Bond Insurer shall specify.
(bb) Repayment of draws and payment of expenses and accrued interest thereon at the Late
Payment Rate (collectively, “Policy Costs”) shall commence in the first month following each draw, and
each such monthly payment shall be in an amount at least equal to 1/12 of the aggregate of Policy Costs
related to such draw.
(cc) Amounts in respect of Policy Costs paid to the Bond Insurer shall be credited first to interest
due, then to the expenses due and then to principal due. As and to the extent that payments are made to
the Bond Insurer on account of principal due, the coverage under the Reserve Policy will be increased by
a like amount, subject to the terms of the Reserve Policy.
(dd) All cash and investments in the debt service reserve fund established for the Bonds (the
“Reserve Fund”) shall be transferred to the debt service fund for payment of debt service on Bonds before
any drawing may be made on the Reserve Policy or any other credit facility credited to the Reserve Fund
in lieu of cash (“Credit Facility”). Payment of any Policy Costs shall be made prior to replenishment of
any such cash amounts. Draws on all Credit Facilities (including the Reserve Policy) on which there is
available coverage shall be made on a pro-rata basis (calculated by reference to the amount of debt
service due on the Related Bonds as a proportion of debt service due on all parity bonds on such payment
date) after applying all available cash and investments in the Reserve Fund. Payment of Policy Costs and
reimbursement of amounts with respect to other Credit Facilities shall be made on a pro-rata basis prior to
replenishment of any cash drawn from the Reserve Fund.
(ee) If the Authority shall fail to pay any Policy Costs in accordance with the requirements of
paragraph (aa), the Bond Insurer shall be entitled to exercise any and all legal and equitable remedies
available to it, including those provided under the Indenture other than (i) acceleration of the maturity of
the Bonds or (ii) remedies which would adversely affect owners of the Bonds.
(ff) The Indenture shall not be discharged until all Policy Costs owing to the Bond Insurer shall
have been paid in full. The Authority's obligation to pay such amounts shall expressly survive payment in
full of the Bonds.
(gg) Additional Bonds may not be issued unless the Authority satisfies the test for the issuance of
Additional Bonds in the Master Indenture adding any Policy Costs then due and owing to the Maximum
Annual Debt Service for purposes of such test.

A-31

(hh) The Trustee shall ascertain the necessity for a claim upon the Reserve Policy and shall
provide notice to the Bond Insurer in accordance with the terms of the Reserve Policy at least five
business days prior to each date upon which interest or principal is due on the Bonds.

ACC FINANCING AMENDMENT

CAPITAL FUND FINANCING AMENDMENT
TO CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS CONTRACT
Section 1. This Capital Fund Financing Amendment to Consolidated Annual Contributions
Contract (“Financing Amendment”) covers the program (the “Program”) for the modernization of public
housing of Boston Housing Authority, a housing authority which is a public body and body corporate and
politic of the State of Massachusetts (the “HA”) to be carried out pursuant to the Capital Fund Program
authorized by section 9(d) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (the “Capital Fund Program”), and in
accordance with the HA’s public housing agency plan, as approved by HUD, together with the proceeds
of certain tax-exempt bond issues (the “Revenue Bonds”) identified below to be issued by the HA and
secured by a pledge of Capital Fund Program moneys (which is further defined to include only CFP
formula funds under Section 9(d) of the Act, but exclude Replacement Housing Factor grant moneys also
under 9(d)) for debt service and subject to the availability of appropriations.
THE BOSTON HOUSING AUTHORITY
(BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS)
CAPITAL PROGRAM REVENUE BONDS, SERIES 2008
(22 DEVELOPMENT MODERNIZATION PROJECTS)

Section 2. This Capital Fund Financing ACC Amendment is amendment #125 to Consolidated
Annual Contributions Contract Form HUD-53012A and Form HUD-53012B Number: NY361 dated
August 7, 1997 (together with any amendments thereto and modifications thereof, the “ACC”).
Section 3. The ACC is amended to evidence the approval by HUD of the issuance of the
Revenue Bonds identified in Section 1 and to permit the first priority pledge and payment of moneys
received under the Capital Fund Program (or any successor thereto) to such Bonds. This Financing
Amendment is part of the ACC.
Section 4. The following provisions are applicable to the Revenue Bonds and the Program,
notwithstanding any provision of the ACC to the contrary:
(A)
References in the ACC to “notes” and “bonds” shall not mean or refer to the Revenue
Bonds. Amounts payable to the HA by HUD pursuant to the Capital Fund Program (and any successor
program for funding modernization needs) and pledged to the payment of debt service on the Revenue
Bonds by the HA shall be used exclusively for debt service on such Revenue Bonds in accordance with
the Debt Service Schedule approved by HUD and described in Section 2 of the HUD approval letter
(“Bond Debt Service”), shall not be available for any other purpose, including but not limited to, (a) the
repayment of any bonds to the HA by HUD pursuant to Section 4 of the United States Housing Act of
1937 (the “Act”), or (b) the repayment of any notes or bonds (other than the Revenue Bonds) as described
in the ACC.

C-1

(B)
The Bonds do not constitute a debt or liability of HUD or the United States, the full faith
and credit of the United States are not pledged to the payment of Bond Debt Service, and Bond Debt
Service is not guaranteed by HUD or the United States.
(C)
Nothing in this Financing Amendment is intended to diminish HUD’s authority to
administer, monitor, and regulate the public housing program, including HUD’s authority to exercise any
administrative sanction or remedy provided by law; provided, however, that except as required by law,
HUD will not assert any claim or right under the ACC, including the exercise of administrative sanctions
and remedies, if and to the extent that the effect of such claim or right would be to reduce the payment of
Capital Fund Program moneys to the HA below the level necessary to pay Bond Debt Service as or delay
the time for payment of such moneys such that required amounts would not be available to pay Bond
Debt Service when due. In the event that HUD shall determine to impose administrative sanctions upon
the HA which would have the effect of reducing the payment of Capital Fund Program moneys to the HA
in any year by more than 20%, HUD shall have the right (in addition to all other rights and remedies
available to HUD), while such sanctions remain in effect, to require that unexpended proceeds of
Revenue Bonds already issued (except for amounts already obligated or encumbered for the payment of
project costs or required for a debt service reserve or other structural purposes of such issue(s)) be
applied, at the earliest permissible date, to redeem outstanding Revenue Bonds.
In the event that the Authority has not obligated at least 90% of the proceeds of the Bonds twenty
three months after the date of the HUD approval letter, unless otherwise approved by HUD, unobligated
proceeds of the Bonds shall be applied, to prepay the Bonds (“Mandatory Obligation Prepayment”) such
that 90% of the balance of the Bonds remaining after the Mandatory Obligation Prepayment shall be
obligated no later than 24 months after the execution of the Bond Documents (“Obligation End Date”).
In the event that the Authority has not expended 100% of the proceeds of the Bonds forty seven
months after the date of the HUD approval letter, unless otherwise approved by HUD, unexpended
proceeds of the Bonds shall be applied to prepay the Bonds (“Mandatory Expenditure Prepayment”) such
that 100% of the balance of the Bonds remaining after the Mandatory Expenditure Prepayment will have
been expended no later than 48 months after the execution of the Bond Documents (“Expenditure End
Date”).
Within 7 days of the Obligation End Date, and then again within 7 days of the Expenditure End
Date, the Authority shall submit a Performance and Evaluation report to the appropriate HUD Field
Office, documenting the obligation and expenditure of the Bond proceeds, along with a Certification
signed by the Executive Director of the Authority, attesting to its accuracy.
(D)
Payment of Bond Debt Service is a permissible use of Capital Fund Program moneys.
Once the Bonds have been approved by HUD, no further approval shall be required for payment of Bond
Debt Service with Capital Fund Program moneys available to the HA.
(E)
The adoption of this Financing Amendment does not supersede or preclude the adoption
of annual Capital Fund plans and annual Capital Fund Program Amendments to the ACC; provided,
however, that if in any fiscal year, (i) the applicable annual Capital Fund plan shall not have been
approved by HUD or (ii) the annual Capital Fund Program Amendment to the ACC shall not have been
executed, in either case, by the later of (i) October 1 of the first year following the end of the applicable
Federal fiscal year with respect to which such funds were appropriated or (ii) 60 days prior to the first
scheduled Bond Debt Service payment following such October 1, HUD agrees, subject to the availability
of appropriations, to approve immediately upon receipt from the HA (subject to any legal requirements or
constraints applicable at the time), an annual Capital Fund plan and/or an annual Capital Fund Program
Amendment to the extent and in an amount sufficient to make the applicable Bond Debt Service payment.
C-2

(F)
Subject to the availability of appropriations and approval of the annual Capital Fund plan
and Capital Fund Program Amendment, and further provided that the HA submits the Post Approval
Documentation described in the HUD approval letter, HUD will make Capital Fund Program moneys
automatically and directly available to the trustee (the “Trustee”) for the Revenue Bonds in accordance
with the approved debt service schedule, to the extent required for payment of Bond Debt Service. Such
direct payment shall be implemented by whatever means are available to HUD at the applicable time, but
in any event, the Trustee shall be able to receive, based upon the direction of the HA pursuant to and as
embodied in this Financing Amendment, the necessary amounts without the need for payment to flow
through the HA.
(G)
Amounts requisitioned by or payable to the Trustee for Bond Debt Service shall not be
paid earlier than three (3) business days prior to the date upon which they are required to make such
payment on the Bonds. HUD agrees that, provided the HA submits the Post Approval Documentation
described in the HUD approval letter, upon determining the amount of Capital Fund Program moneys
available to the HA in any fiscal year, it will not permit disbursements of such moneys for purposes other
than Bond Debt Service in accordance with the Debt Service Schedule approved by HUD to an extent that
would reduce the amounts available for such fiscal year below the amounts scheduled for Bond Debt
Service in such fiscal year.
(H)
The Authority certifies that the number of ACC units anticipated to be eligible for Capital
Fund Allocations in each year through the maturity date of the financing will not be less than 9,764
(“Base Unit Count”) except as noted on the attached portfolio schedule. The Authority covenants not to
reduce the number of ACC units by more than 5% (cumulatively) below the Base Unit Count without the
prepayment, redemption, defeasance or refunding of the Bonds to the extent necessary to maintain the
same debt coverage ratio in the Bond year immediately following such reduction in ACC Units (based on
the then current year’s capital fund allocation but giving effect to the reduction in ACC Units in a manner
acceptable to HUD) as existed prior to the reduction; provided, however, that in no event shall the HA be
required to maintain a debt coverage ratio in excess of 3.0 in any Revenue Bond year; and provided,
further that if the reduction in units is required by law or public housing requirements, the PHA shall not
be required to redeem the bonds prior to such reduction, but instead shall do so as soon as possible after
becoming aware of the requirement of law or public housing requirements. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the PHA in any event shall not be required to use Capital Funds to redeem bonds to the extent
that the Capital Funds to be used by the PHA are otherwise needed to address the health and safety issues
in the PHA’s public housing portfolio.
(I)
The proceeds of the Bonds may be expended only for purposes for which public housing
Capital Fund Program moneys may be expended. The HA shall provide for the application of the
proceeds of the Bonds (in such detail as shall be reasonably required by HUD) in its annual and 5-year
Capital Fund plans. All such uses of Bond proceeds shall be subject to HUD approval (as part of HUD’s
approval of HA’s annual plan) and the HA shall report to HUD annually with respect to such
expenditures in the same manner as it accounts for the expenditure of Capital Fund Program moneys.
Section 5. HA Representations and Assurances. By executing this Financing Amendment,
the HA represents, warrants and agrees that it will apply all proceeds of the Bonds (i) as approved by
HUD in connection with HUD’s consent to issuance of the Bonds and (ii) to expenditures which are
permissible under the laws and regulations governing the Capital Fund Program (or any applicable
successor). Additionally, the HA represents, warrants and agrees that it has insurance coverage in
conformance with public housing requirements including the Consolidated ACC, and, other than its self
insurance with respect to general liability claims, it does not presently have a waiver of any form of
required insurance or a self insurance fund as defined in Section 4 of the ACC. The HA hereby covenants
C-3

that prior to terminating or amending any form of required insurance or seeking permission to self insure
in accordance with Section 4 of the ACC and the public housing requirements, it shall apply to HUD for a
waiver of any form of required insurance or permission to self insure and it shall obtain written approval
from HUD to amend its CFFP proposal approval and CFF Amendment to explicitly permit such action.
In consideration of the foregoing covenants, the parties do hereby set forth their seals:

APPENDIX D
FORM OF BOND COUNSEL OPINION

Boston Housing Authority
52 Chauncy Street
Boston, Massachusetts 02111
We have examined certified copies of the proceedings of the Boston Housing Authority (herein
called the “Authority”), a body politic and corporate and a public instrumentality of The Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and other proofs submitted to us relative to the issuance and sale of $78,550,000 Capital
Fund Revenue Bonds, Series 2008 (the “Series 2008 Bonds”). All capitalized terms used herein which are
not otherwise defined have the meaning given those terms as set forth in the Indenture (as hereinafter
defined).
In rendering the opinion set forth herein, we have relied upon the accuracy of the representations of
the Authority as set forth in such papers and documents as we have deemed necessary in connection with
this opinion, including without limitation, the Authority’s Tax Certificate delivered in connection with the
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds.
Based upon our examination, we are of the opinion that:
(a)
Such proceedings and proofs show lawful authority for the issuance and sale of the Series
2008 Bonds pursuant to the Constitution and statutes of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including
particularly Chapter 121B of the General Laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts as amended and
supplemented (the “Act”), and other applicable provisions of law, and pursuant and subject to the
provisions, terms and conditions of the Master Trust Indenture dated as of April 1, 2008, between the
Authority and U.S. Bank National Association (the “Trustee”) (the “Master Trust Indenture”) and the
First Supplemental Trust Indenture dated as of April 1, 2008, between the Authority and the Trustee (the
“Supplemental Trust Indenture”). The Master Trust Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture are
referred to collectively as the “Indenture.”
(b)
The Authority has the right and power under the Act to enter into the Indenture, and the
Indenture has been duly and lawfully executed by the Authority, is in full force and effect and is valid and
binding upon the Authority and enforceable in accordance with its terms, and no other authorization for the
Indenture is required; provided that no opinion is expressed as to the enforceability of the Indenture in
accordance with its terms to the extent that the enforcement of any provision thereof may be limited by any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, or other laws or judicial decisions or
equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights or contractual obligations generally and judicial discretion and
no opinion is being rendered as to the availability of any particular remedy thereunder. The Indenture
creates the valid pledge of and the valid lien which it purports to create upon the Revenues described in
the Indenture, subject only to the provisions of the Indenture permitting the use and payment thereof for
or to the purposes and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture.
(c)
The Series 2008 Bonds are valid and binding special obligations of the Authority as
provided in the Indenture, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and of the Act, and the Series 2008 Bonds
have been duly and validly authorized and issued in accordance with law, including the Act and the
Indenture. In addition, the Series 2008 Bonds are secured by a pledge of certain Revenues and other funds
held under the Indenture as described above.

D-1

(d)
The Authority may, within the terms, provisions and limitations contained in the Indenture,
issue additional Bonds which will rank equally as to security and payment with the Series 2008 Bonds. The
Authority may also issue subordinate lien bonds under the Indenture.
(e)
(i)
Under existing law, interest on the Series 2008 Bonds will not be included in the
gross income of the holders of the Series 2008 Bonds for federal income tax purposes under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). This opinion is rendered subject to the condition that
certain requirements of the Code be satisfied subsequent to the date of issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds in
order that interest be and remain excluded from gross income for federal tax purposes. Failure to comply
with such requirements could cause the interest on the Series 2008 Bonds to be included in gross income
retroactive to the date of issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds.
(ii)
Interest on the Series 2008 Bonds is not an item of tax preference for purposes of
the alternative minimum tax imposed under federal tax law on certain corporations and individuals,
although interest on the Series 2008 Bonds is included in the adjusted current earnings of certain
corporations for purposes of calculating the alternative minimum tax imposed on such corporations.
(f)
Under existing law, interest on the Series 2008 Bonds, and any profit on the sale thereof, are
exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the Series 2008 Bonds are exempt from
Massachusetts personal property taxes.
(g)
Except as set forth in paragraph (e), we express no opinion as to federal tax consequences of
holding the Series 2008 Bonds, and except as set forth in paragraph (f), we express no opinion as to
Massachusetts tax consequences arising with respect to the Series 2008 Bonds. We express no opinion as to
the taxability of the Series 2008 Bonds, their transfer and the income therefrom, including any profit made
on the sale thereof, under the laws of states other than Massachusetts.
(h)
For federal income tax and Massachusetts personal income tax purposes, interest
includes original issue discount. Original issue discount with respect to a Series 2008 Bond is equal to the
excess, if any, of the stated redemption price at maturity of such Series 2008 Bond over the initial offering
price thereof to the public, excluding underwriters and other intermediaries, at which price a substantial
amount of all Series 2008 Bonds with the same maturity and CUSIP designation were sold. Original issue
discount accrues actuarially over the term of a Series 2008 Bond. Holders should consult their own tax
advisers with respect to the computation of such accruals during the period in which any such Series 2008
Bond is held.
Very truly yours,

Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C.

APPENDIX E
DTC AND BOOK ENTRY
DTC will act as securities depository for the Series 2008 Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds will be
issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or
such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Bond
certificate will be issued for each maturity of the Series 2008 Bonds, each in the aggregate principal
amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.
DTC, the world’s largest depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New
York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a
member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing Authority” within the meaning of the New York
Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 2 million issues
of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments
from over 85 countries that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also
facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in
deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct
Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct
Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies,
clearing corporation, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Depository Trust & Clearing Authority (“DTCC”). DTCC, in turn, is owned by a number of Direct
Participants of DTC and Members of the National Securities Clearing Authority, Government Securities
Clearing Authority, MBS Clearing Authority, and Emerging Markets Clearing Authority, (NSCC, GSCC,
MBSCC, and EMCC, also subsidiaries of DTCC), as well as by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the
American Stock Exchange LLC, and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Access to the
DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies, and clearing corporation that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has Standard &
Poor’s highest rating: AAA. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.
Purchases of Series 2008 Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct
Participants, which will receive a credit for the Securities on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of
each actual purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and
Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their
purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of
the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant
through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the
Series 2008 Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect
Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates
representing their ownership interests in Series 2008 Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry
system for the Series 2008 Bonds is discontinued.
To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Series 2008 Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with
DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may
be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Securities with DTC and their
registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial
ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Series 2008 Bonds; DTC’s

E-1

records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Series 2008 Bonds are
credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will
remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.
Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct
Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial
Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory
requirements as may be in effect from time to time.
Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to
Series 2008 Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s Procedures.
Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Authority as soon as possible after the
record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct
Participants to whose accounts Series 2008 Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing
attached to the Omnibus Proxy).
Redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments on the Series 2008 Bonds will be
made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.
DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding
detail information from the Authority or the Trustee, on payable date in accordance with their respective
holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by
standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of
customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant
and not of DTC, the Authority or the Trustee, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may
be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to
Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the
responsibility of the Authority or the Trustee, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will
be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the
responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.
DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Series 2008 Bonds
at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Authority or the Trustee. Under such circumstances, in the
event that a successor depository is not obtained, Series 2008 Bonds certificates are required to be printed
and delivered.
The Authority may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC
(or a successor securities depository). In that event, Series 2008 Bonds certificates will be printed and
delivered.
The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained
from sources that the Authority believes to be reliable, but the Authority takes no responsibility for the
accuracy thereof.

Security. The Insurer's Fiscal Agent is the agent of Financial Security only and the Insurer's Fiscal Agent

Security to deposit or cause to be deposited sufficient funds to make payments due under this Policy.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Financial Security agrees not to assert, and hereby
