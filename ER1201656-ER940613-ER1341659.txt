In the opinion of Locke Lord LLP, Bond Counsel, based upon an analysis of existing law and assuming,
among other matters, compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income
for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Interest on the Bonds will not be
included in computing the alternative minimum taxable income of individuals. Under existing law, interest on
the Bonds is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts
personal property taxes. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to
the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds. See “Tax Exemption” herein.

OFFICIAL STATEMENT
of the
CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
relating to
$145,130,000
GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS, 2019 SERIES A

This Official Statement (which includes the cover page and Appendices hereto) provides information
concerning the City of Boston, Massachusetts (the “City”) and the $145,130,000 General Obligation Bonds, 2019
Series A (the “Bonds”), to be issued by the City as described herein. Certain credit factors concerning the Bonds are
described throughout this Official Statement, which should be read in its entirety. This Official Statement speaks
only as of its date and the information contained herein is subject to change after this date.
THE CITY
The City of Boston, incorporated as a town in 1630 and as a city in 1822, is the largest city in Massachusetts
and the capital of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Commonwealth”). The City and its component
governmental units are responsible for the provision of a wide range of government services, including education,
public safety, public health, urban planning and development and the maintenance of the City’s infrastructure, and
for funding certain employee benefits, state authority assessments and debt service requirements. Its primary sources
of revenue are property taxes, state aid and certain excises. Management of the City’s finances includes preparation
of annual operating and capital budgets, the exercise of expenditure controls and cash management. For a full
discussion concerning the City, and its finances, see “Appendix A—City of Boston, Massachusetts, Information
Statement dated February 26, 2019 (the “Information Statement”).”
As the economic hub of New England, Boston is a center for professional, financial, higher educational and
medical services, and the focus of tourist and convention travel in New England. For a description of certain
demographic and economic information about the City, see “Appendix A—Exhibit III—City of Boston—Selected
Demographic and Economic Information.”
SECURITY FOR THE BONDS
The Bonds will be valid general obligations of the City, for the payment of the principal of and interest on
which the full faith and credit of the City will be pledged. To the extent not paid from other legally available
revenues of the City, the Bonds are payable from ad valorem taxes which may be levied upon all taxable property in
the City without limit as to rate or amount.
Chapter 643 of the Acts of 1983 of the Commonwealth, as amended (the “Bond Procedure Act of 1983”),
requires that the debt and interest charges on all general obligation indebtedness of the City (including the Bonds), if
not otherwise provided for, be included in the City’s annual tax levy. The Bond Procedure Act of 1983 also
mandates assessment of taxes in excess of the levy limits imposed by the statewide property tax limit (“Proposition
2½”) to the extent that the debt service on City obligations is not otherwise provided for in the tax levy or from other
sources, with no allowance made for any other expenditures of the City. See “City Revenues—Property Taxes—
Proposition 2½” in the Information Statement. Holders of City obligations do not have a statutory priority with
respect to or a security interest in the portion of the tax levy attributable to such obligations. See “City
Indebtedness—Classification of City Debt” in the Information Statement.
In the opinion of Bond Counsel, the City is subject to suit on the Bonds, and courts of competent jurisdiction
have power in appropriate proceedings to order payment of a judgment on the Bonds from available funds or, in the
absence of available funds, to order the inclusion of the required amount in the next annual tax levy. In exercising
their discretion as to whether to enter such an order, the courts could take into account all relevant factors, including
the current operating needs of the City and the availability and adequacy of other remedies. The Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court has stated in the past that a judgment against a municipality can be enforced by the taking
and sale of property of any inhabitant. There has been no judicial determination, however, as to whether the remedy
is constitutional under current due process and equal protection standards.

.

1

Payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds is not secured by or limited to a pledge of any particular
revenue source of the City. Chapter 190 of the Acts of 1982 of the Commonwealth (the “1982 Funding Loan Act”)
and the Bond Procedure Act of 1983 authorize the City to pledge to the payment of any of its general obligation
notes or bonds all or any part of the revenues of the City derived from any tax, fee, distribution or reimbursement
payable to the City (except distributions and reimbursements required by law to be specifically used for statutorily
defined purposes), including state aid distributions and the proceeds of the City’s annual property tax levy. No
obligations are currently outstanding which are secured by such a pledge. The Bond Procedure Act of 1983 also
authorizes the City to issue special obligation bonds payable solely from the revenues of a revenue-producing
facility, and Chapter 152 of the Acts of 1997, as amended (the “Convention Center Act”), authorized the City to
pledge certain excise receipts and other revenues of the City to the payment of bonds of the City issued under the
authority of the Convention Center Act. As of the date of this Official Statement, the City is not authorized to issue
any additional bonds under the Convention Center Act and no special obligation indebtedness of the City remains
outstanding. See “City Indebtedness—Special Obligation Debt” in the Information Statement. To the extent required
for the payment of any such secured indebtedness, the revenues pledged to their payment would not be available to
pay the Bonds.
Except to the extent specifically pledged to the payment of certain indebtedness, state aid distributions to the
City are generally available for the payment of bonds or notes of the City, but, under certain circumstances, they
may be unavailable to the extent such distributions are applied to the payment of “qualified bonds” issued by the
City (none of which bonds have been issued), or to the extent that such distributions may be applied under state law
to the satisfaction of unpaid assessments due the Commonwealth from the City for debt issued by the Massachusetts
Bay Transportation Authority, or for obligations of the City or of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission issued to
the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust, formerly known as Massachusetts Water Pollution Abatement Trust. See
“City Indebtedness—Classification of City Debt” in the Information Statement.
State statutes also provide that certain parking meter receipts may be used only for parking and related
purposes and, accordingly, monies derived from this source may be unavailable to pay general obligation bonds and
notes issued for other purposes. In addition, subject to certain limits, the City may annually authorize the
establishment of one or more revolving funds in connection with the use of certain revenues for programs that
produce those revenues. If it accepts certain statutory provisions, the City may also establish enterprise funds for
certain purposes, including for a health care, solid waste, recreational or transportation facility, and for police or fire
services. Under those provisions any surplus in the fund is restricted to use for capital expenditures or reduction of
user charges. The City has not established any such enterprise funds.
Section 19A of Chapter 44 of the General Laws provides, in part, that if the City is or is likely to be unable to
pay principal of or interest on any of its bonds or notes when due, it shall notify the state Commissioner of Revenue.
The Commissioner shall certify such inability to the State Treasurer. The State Treasurer shall pay the due or
overdue amount by the later of three days after the certification or one business day prior to the due date. This
payment is limited, however, to the estimated amounts distributable by the Commonwealth to the City during the
remainder of the fiscal year. If, for any reason, any portion of the certified sum has not been paid at the end of the
fiscal year, the State Treasurer shall pay it as soon as practicable in the next fiscal year to the extent of the estimated
distributions for such fiscal year. The sums so paid shall be charged with interest and administrative costs against the
distributions to the City. The foregoing provisions are not a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth. The
Commonwealth has not agreed to maintain existing levels of state distributions and the law requiring the
Commonwealth to use estimated distributions to pay debt service may be subject to repeal by future legislation.
Moreover, adoption of the state’s annual appropriation act is often delayed beyond the beginning of the fiscal year,
and estimated distributions which are subject to appropriation may be unavailable to pay local debt service until they
are appropriated.
The rights of the holders of the Bonds and the enforceability of payment of the Bonds may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights heretofore or
hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable and their enforcement may also be subject to the exercise
of judicial discretion in appropriate cases. Massachusetts municipalities are not generally authorized by the
Massachusetts General Laws to file a petition for bankruptcy under federal bankruptcy laws.

THE BONDS
Description
The Bonds will be dated the date of delivery thereof, expected to be March 19, 2019, and will mature on
March 1 of the years, and in the amounts, and will bear interest calculated on the basis of 30-day months and a 360day year at the rates, shown on the cover of this Official Statement. Interest on the Bonds will be payable on
September 1, 2019 and semiannually thereafter on each March 1 and September 1 until maturity or redemption prior
to maturity, provided that if such day is not a business day, interest will be payable on the next business day.
The Bonds will be issued by means of a book-entry system, with bond certificates immobilized at The
Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). Bond certificates will not be available for distribution
to the public and will evidence ownership of the Bonds in principal amounts of $5,000 or integral multiples thereof,
with transfers of ownership effected on the records of DTC and its participants pursuant to rules and procedures
established by DTC and its participants. Interest on the Bonds will be paid on the interest payment dates or upon
redemption, and principal of the Bonds will be paid at maturity or upon redemption, to DTC or its nominee as
registered owner of the Bonds. Transfer of principal or redemption price and interest payments to participants of
DTC will be the responsibility of DTC; transfer of principal or redemption price and interest payments to beneficial
owners by participants of DTC will be the responsibility of such participants and other nominees of beneficial
owners. The record date for principal or redemption price and interest payments will be the fifteenth day of the
month next preceding a debt service payment date or, if such day is not a business day, the next succeeding business
day. The City will not be responsible or liable for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records maintained by
DTC, its participants or persons acting through such participants.
U.S. Bank National Association, Boston, Massachusetts, will act as paying agent for the Bonds (the “Paying
Agent”).
Authorization and Purpose
The Bonds will be issued pursuant to the Bond Procedures Act of 1983 and various loan orders of the City
Council approved by the Mayor. The Bonds will be issued to finance various capital projects of the City.
Redemption Prior To Maturity
Optional Redemption
The Bonds maturing on or before March 1, 2029 will not be subject to redemption prior to maturity. The
Bonds maturing after March 1, 2029 will be subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option of the City, on or
after March 1, 2029, as a whole or in part at any time, in such order of maturity as the City may determine and by lot
within each maturity as selected by DTC and its participants, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of
the Bonds to be redeemed, plus accrued interest to the redemption date.
Notice of Redemption
Notice of redemption of Bonds, specifying the numbers, series and maturities of the Bonds or portions thereof
to be redeemed and the redemption date, will be given by the Paying Agent not more than 60 days nor less than 30
days prior to the redemption date by notice mailed to DTC or its nominee, or in such other manner acceptable to
DTC, as registered owner of the Bonds to be redeemed. The City will not be responsible for mailing notices of
redemption to anyone other than DTC or its nominee. Notice having been given, the Bonds or portions thereof
called for redemption will become due and payable on the designated redemption date. If on the redemption date
monies are available for the redemption of the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, together with interest
accrued to the redemption date, then interest on such Bonds or portions thereof shall thereafter cease to accrue.
The redemption notice may state that it is conditioned upon the deposit of moneys in an amount equal to the
amount necessary to effect the redemption, in a separate account established by the City for such purpose no later
than the redemption date, or that the City may rescind such notice at any time prior to the scheduled redemption date
if the City’s Chief Financial Officer and Collector-Treasurer delivers a notice thereof to the registered owner of the
Bonds. The redemption notice and optional redemption shall be of no effect if such moneys are not so deposited or if
the notice is rescinded, and the failure of the City to make funds available in whole or in part on or before the
redemption date shall not constitute a default. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, and the amount
necessary to effect the redemption having been so deposited, the Bonds called for redemption shall become due and
payable on the redemption date, and from and after such date, such Bonds shall cease to bear interest.

3

Book-Entry Transfer System
DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds. The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities
registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an
authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of the
Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of that maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.
DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New
York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the
Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code,
and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and
municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct
Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales
and other securities transactions, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and
pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC, is the holding company for DTC, National, and
Securities Clearing Corporation, and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing
agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated securities. Access to the DTC system is also available to
others as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly
(“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants
are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at
www.dtcc.com and www.dtc.org.
Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive
a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial
Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive
written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written
confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or
Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership
interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting
on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership
interests in the Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.
To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the
name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an authorized
representative of DTC. The deposit of the Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such
other DTC nominee do not affect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual
Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts
such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will
remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.
Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to
Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by
arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.
Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within a maturity of a series are being
redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such
maturity to be redeemed.
Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the Bonds
unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI procedures. Under its usual procedures,
DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the City as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede
& Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Bonds are credited on the
record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).
Principal or redemption price and interest payments on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or such other
nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct
Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the City or the
Paying Agent on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments
by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the
case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the
4

responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC or, its nominee, the Paying Agent, or the City, subject to any
statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal or redemption price
and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is
the responsibility of the City or the Paying Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants shall be the
responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners shall be the responsibility of
Direct and Indirect Participants.
DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by
giving reasonable notice to the City or the Paying Agent. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor
securities depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered to DTC.
The City may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a
successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certificates will be printed and delivered.
The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from
sources that the City believes to be reliable, but the City takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

LITIGATION
No litigation is pending or, to the knowledge of the City’s Corporation Counsel, threatened (a) seeking to
restrain or enjoin the issuance or delivery of the Bonds, (b) contesting or affecting any authority for or the validity of
the Bonds, (c) contesting the power of the City to issue the Bonds or the power of the City to offer and sell the
Bonds to the purchaser(s) thereof, (d) contesting the power of the City to levy and collect taxes to pay the Bonds, (e)
contesting the corporate existence or boundaries of the City, or (f) contesting the title of officials of the City who
have acted with respect to the proceedings for the issuance and sale of the Bonds to their respective offices.
There are pending in courts within the Commonwealth various suits in which the City is a defendant. No
litigation is pending or, to the knowledge of the City’s Corporation Counsel, threatened which is likely to have a
material adverse impact on its ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds when due or the City’s longterm financial condition. While the ultimate outcome and fiscal impact, if any, on the City of pending and
threatened proceedings and claims are not currently predictable, adverse determinations in certain of them could
have a programmatic or budgetary impact on the City.
TAX EXEMPTION
In the opinion of Locke Lord LLP, Bond Counsel to the City (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of
existing laws, regulations, rulings, and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, compliance with certain
covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”). Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the
Bonds will not be included in computing the alternative minimum taxable income of Bondholders who are
individuals. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other federal tax consequences arising with respect to
the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds.
The Code imposes various requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax
purposes of interest on obligations such as the Bonds. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in
interest on the Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of
original issuance of the Bonds. The City has covenanted to comply with such requirements to ensure that interest on
the Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes compliance with
these requirements.
Bond Counsel is also of the opinion that, under existing law, interest on the Bonds is exempt from
Massachusetts personal income taxes, and the Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property taxes. Bond
Counsel has not opined as to other Massachusetts tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds. Prospective
Bondholders should be aware, however, that the Bonds are included in the measure of Massachusetts estate and
inheritance taxes, and the Bonds and the interest thereon are included in the measure of certain Massachusetts
corporate excise and franchise taxes. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion as to the taxability of the Bonds or the
income therefrom or any other tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds under the laws of any state other
than Massachusetts.
A complete copy of the proposed form of the opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to the Bonds is set forth in
Appendix B hereto.
To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at maturity of such
Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the term of such Bonds), the
difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the accrual of which, to the extent properly allocable to each owner
thereof, is treated as interest on the Bonds which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and
is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes. For this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of the
Bonds is the reasonably expected initial offering price to the public or the first price at which a substantial amount of
such maturity of the Bonds is sold to the public, as applicable. The original issue discount with respect to any
maturity of the Bonds accrues daily over the term to maturity of such Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate
compounded semiannually (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The accruing original
issue discount is added to the adjusted basis of such Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon disposition
6

(including sale, redemption, or payment on maturity) of such Bonds. Bondowners should consult their own tax
advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of Bonds with original issue discount, including the
treatment of purchasers who do not purchase such Bonds in the original offering to the public at the reasonably
expected initial offering price to the public, or, if applicable, the first price at which a substantial amount of such
Bonds is sold to the public.
Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount greater than the stated principal
amount to be paid at maturity of such Bonds, or, in some cases, at the earlier redemption date of such Bonds
(“Premium Bonds”), will be treated as having amortizable bond premium for federal income tax purposes and
Massachusetts personal income tax purposes. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the
case of obligations, such as the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes. However, a Bondowner’s basis in a Premium Bond will be reduced by the amount of
amortizable bond premium properly allocable to such Bondowner. Holders of Premium Bonds should consult their
own tax advisors with respect to the proper treatment of amortizable bond premium in their particular circumstances.
Prospective Bondowners should be aware that certain requirements and procedures contained or referred to in
the relevant documents may be changed and certain actions may be taken or omitted under the circumstances and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in such documents. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or
to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken) or events occurring (or not occurring) after the date
of issuance of the Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the Bonds.
Risk of Future Legislative Changes and/or Court Decisions
Legislation affecting tax-exempt obligations is regularly considered by the United States Congress and may
also be considered by the Massachusetts legislature. Court proceedings may also be filed, the outcome of which
could modify the tax treatment of obligations such as the Bonds. There can be no assurance that legislation enacted
or proposed, or actions by a court, after the date of issuance of the Bonds will not have an adverse effect on the tax
status of interest on the Bonds or the market value or marketability of the Bonds. These adverse effects could result,
for example, from changes to federal or state income tax rates, changes in the structure of federal or state income
taxes (including replacement with another type of tax), or repeal (or reduction in the benefit) of the exclusion of
interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal or state income tax purposes for all or certain taxpayers.
For example, H.R. 1, signed into law on December 22, 2017, reduces the corporate tax rate, modifies
individual tax rates, eliminates many deductions, and raises the income threshold above which the individual
alternative minimum tax is invoked, among other things. These changes may increase, reduce or otherwise change
the financial benefits of owning state and local government bonds. Additionally, Bondowners should be aware that
future legislative actions (including federal income tax reform) may retroactively change the treatment of all or a
portion of the interest on the Bonds for federal income tax purposes for all or certain taxpayers. In all such events,
the market value of the Bonds may be affected and the ability of Bondowners to sell their Bonds in the secondary
market may be reduced. The Bonds are not subject to special mandatory redemption, and the interest rates on the
Bonds are not subject to adjustment, in the event of any such change in the tax treatment of interest on the Bonds.
Prospective Bondowners are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to any such legislation,
interpretation or development.
Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes and is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or
the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds may otherwise affect the federal or state tax liability of a Bondholder.
Among other possible consequences of ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the
Bonds, the Code requires recipients of certain social security and certain railroad retirement benefits to take into
account receipts or accruals of interest on the Bonds in determining the portion of such benefits that are included in
gross income. The nature and extent of all such other tax consequences will depend upon the particular tax status of
the Bondholder or the Bondholder’s other items of income, deduction or exclusion. Bond Counsel expresses no
opinion regarding any such other tax consequences and Bondholders should consult with their own tax advisors with
respect to such consequences.
CREDIT RATINGS
Moody’s Investors Service Inc., 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, and
S&P Global Ratings, 55 Water Street, New York, New York, have assigned the ratings of “Aaa” and “AAA,”
respectively, to the Bonds, reflecting the City’s capacity to pay debt service. Such ratings reflect only the views of
such organizations and any desired explanation of the significance of such ratings should be obtained from the rating
agency furnishing the same. Generally, a rating agency bases its rating on the information and materials furnished to
it and on investigations, studies and assumptions of its own. There is no assurance that any such ratings will
continue for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely by the
7

rating agency concerned, if in the judgment of such rating agency, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward
revision or withdrawal of any such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Bonds.
COMPETITIVE SALE OF BONDS
The Bonds were offered for sale by competitive bidding on March 5, 2019, in accordance with the Official
Notice of Sale dated February 26, 2019 (the “Official Notice of Sale”) attached hereto as Appendix D. J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC was the successful bidder for the Bonds. Information provided by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
regarding the interest rates and reoffering yields of the Bonds is set forth on the front cover of this Official
Statement. The Bonds are being purchased from the City by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC at an aggregate price of
$170,818,196.88, reflecting the principal amount of $145,130,000.00, plus net original issue premium of
$25,798,052.45, less underwriter’s discount of $109,855.57.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and any of their respective associates underwriting the Bonds may offer to sell the
bonds to certain dealers and others at prices other than the initial offering prices, and the public offering prices may
be changed from time to time by the underwriters.
LEGAL MATTERS
All legal matters incidental to the authorization and issuance of the Bonds are subject to the approval of Locke
Lord LLP, Boston, Massachusetts, Bond Counsel to the City. Reference should be made to the form of opinion of
Bond Counsel set forth in Appendix B for the matters to be covered therein. In addition, Corporation Counsel of the
City will certify as to the accuracy of the statements contained in the first paragraph under the caption “Litigation.”
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The financial statements of the City of Boston included as Exhibit I to Appendix A of this Official Statement
have been audited by KPMG LLP, independent auditors, to the extent and for the period indicated in their report
thereon.
MUNICIPAL ADVISOR
PFM Financial Advisors LLC (“PFM”), Boston, Massachusetts, serves as municipal advisor to the City in
connection with the issuance of the Bonds. PFM is not obligated to undertake, and has not undertaken, either to
make an independent verification of or to assume responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the
information contained in this Official Statement and the appendices hereto. PFM is an independent financial
advisory firm and is not engaged in the business of underwriting, trading or distributing securities.
CONTINUING DISCLOSURE
In order to assist the underwriter in complying with Rule 15c2-12 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “Rule”), the City will covenant for the benefit of owners of the Bonds to provide certain financial
information and operating data relating to the City by not later than 270 days after the end of each fiscal year (the
“Annual Report”), and to provide notices of occurrence of certain enumerated events. The covenants will be
contained in a Continuing Disclosure Certificate, the proposed form of which is provided in Appendix C (the
“Certificate”). The Certificate will be executed on the delivery date of the Bonds and incorporated by reference in
the Bonds. The City has executed previous undertakings to provide annual reports or notices of material events in
accordance with the Rule and to the best of its knowledge has never failed to comply in all material respects with
any such undertaking within the previous five years. The City has implemented procedures to ensure timely filing of
annual reports and notices of certain enumerated events required under its continuing disclosure undertakings.
In order to assist the City in carrying out its obligations under the Certificate and under its other continuing
disclosure undertakings, the City has entered into an agreement with Digital Assurance Certification, LLC (“DAC”)

A description of certain City principal governmental services follows:
Schools
The City’s School Department provides both basic education and college preparatory curricula as
well as specialized vocational educational programs. The school system enrolled approximately 54,300
students for the 2018-2019 school year, which is a decrease from the previous year. There are 125 schools
in the Boston Public Schools, including: 7 schools for early learners, 40 elementary schools (K-5), 33
elementary & middle schools (K-8), 6 middle schools (6-8), 4 middle & high schools (6-12), 1 K-12
school, 20 high schools (9-12), 3 exam schools (7-12), 6 special education schools, and 5 alternative (atrisk) schools and programs.
Pursuant to Chapter 108 of the Acts of 1992, the City’s public schools are under the control of a
School Committee, which consists of seven members appointed by the Mayor. Members of the School
Committee have staggered four-year terms. In addition to appointing the Superintendent of Schools, the
Boston School Committee approves the School Department budget for submission to the Mayor, and by
and through the Superintendent, determines educational policy, makes all contracts for the purchase of
materials for the operations of the schools, and maintains and operates school properties. The
Superintendent of Schools has exclusive authority to make appointments and promotions for all teachers
and other School Department personnel except for the positions of Community Superintendent, Chairman,
Secretary, or Treasurer of the School Committee, and School Committee Administrative Assistants. The
School Committee appoints these excepted positions.
Following the departure of the Superintendent, in July 2018 the Boston School Committee appointed
an interim superintendent until such time that a permanent superintendent could be found. The School
Committee has engaged a search firm and is in the midst of a nationwide search for a permanent
superintendent. Additional information on the search process and any updates are available on the Boston
Public Schools’ website at https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/superintendentsearch.
Public Safety
Public Safety is continuing to improve citywide service-delivery through consolidated and shared
resources to provide more effective and efficient public safety services to Boston’s communities.

A-7

The Boston Police Department maintains 11 neighborhood police stations and one headquarters
building. The Department also maintains 12 support locations, consisting of the Charlestown Neighborhood
Sub-Station, Police Academy, Firearms Training Range, Harbor Patrol Unit, Fleet Management Division,
Telecommunications Division, Evidence and Property Management Division, Special Operations Division,
Stress Support Unit, Recruit Investigation Unit, Field Support Division, and the K-9 unit.
The Fire Department maintains 40 facilities consisting of 34 neighborhood fire stations, one marine
unit, a training academy, a fire alarm division, a headquarters including a maintenance division, a fire
investigation building including a fire prevention division, and a high-pressure pumping station.
The Mayor’s Office of Emergency Management coordinates and directs Boston’s interdepartmental
and multi-jurisdictional homeland security activities by advising the Mayor on issues and obtaining and
managing outside funding.
Public Health
The Boston Public Health Commission (“BPHC”), successor to the City’s Department of Health and
Hospitals, is a body politic and corporate separate from the City created in 1996 when the operations of the
City’s former acute-care hospital, Boston City Hospital, were consolidated with the operations of Boston
University Medical Center Hospital under the control of the Boston Medical Center Corporation
(“BMCC”), a private, Massachusetts non-profit corporation. The BPHC is governed by a seven-member
board, six of whom are appointed by the Mayor, subject to confirmation by the City Council, and one of
whom, as the chief executive officer of BMCC, serves ex-officio. The BPHC functions as the City’s board
of health and operates a wide range of public health programs throughout the City funded from public and
private grants and City appropriations. The BPHC is a discretely presented component unit for GAAP
reporting purposes in the City’s annual audited financial statements. See “City Indebtedness—Debt of
Agencies Related to the City—Boston Public Health Commission” and “Employee Benefits.”
Public Works
The Public Works Department constructs and maintains highways, sidewalks, street lighting and
bridges, and oversees snow removal, street cleaning, refuse removal and recycling.
The Boston Water and Sewer Commission, is an independent body politic and corporate and a
political subdivision of the Commonwealth created in July 1977, and is responsible for the operation and
maintenance of the City’s water, sewer, and storm water drainage systems, the construction of
improvements to those systems, and the collection of user charges for its services. See “City
Indebtedness—Debt of Agencies Related to the City—Boston Water and Sewer Commission” below.
Other Services
The Boston Public Library system is made up of the Central Library in Copley Square, which
includes the Leventhal Map Center and Kirstein Business Library, 25 neighborhood branches throughout
the City, and online services including digital content, access to the catalog, and education. The Parks and
Recreation Department manages approximately 2,200 acres of active, passive and historic parkland. The
2,200 acres of land include 272 parks, playgrounds, squares, malls, plazas, and other miscellaneous sites;
16 historic and three active cemeteries; one greenhouse facility; and approximately 35,000 street trees.
Suffolk County
While existing state law provides that the Mayor and City Council serve as the Commissioners of
Suffolk County, which includes the cities of Boston, Chelsea, Revere and the Town of Winthrop, all of the
functions and costs of county government (including the county courts, registry of deeds and the Office of
the Suffolk County Sheriff) have been assumed by the Commonwealth, except for an annual assessment by
the Commonwealth for the purpose of funding the unfunded portion of pension liability for retirees of the
Office of the Suffolk County Sheriff who retired prior to January 1, 2010. This annual assessment can be
no greater than the City’s fiscal 2009 appropriation to support the Office of the Suffolk County Sheriff of
approximately $4.0 million, and will terminate when the pension liability of these retirees is fully funded.

Employee Relations
Under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 150E, most municipal employees in the Commonwealth
enjoy the right to join labor unions and bargain collectively over wages and other terms and conditions of
employment. The Office of Labor Relations represents the Mayor and the City in all collective bargaining
matters with all unions that represent City employees except School Department employees. The School
Department’s labor relations personnel similarly represent the School Committee and consult with the
Office of Labor Relations regarding contract negotiations and other general labor matters concerning the
unions that represent School Department employees. Additionally, the Office of Labor Relations has
actively assisted the Boston Public Health Commission in collective bargaining negotiations with its 9
bargaining units and regularly interfaces with the Boston Public Health Commission on labor and
employment matters.
Nearly all of the City’s non-school department employees are organized into bargaining units
represented by various unions. Most of these unions are affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Three large unions,
the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (“AFSCME”) Council 93 (laborer
employees), the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) Local 285 (clerical employees), and the
Salaried Employees of North America (“SENA”) Local 9158 (middle manager employees) represent the
majority of the City’s non-public safety employees.
Police officers are represented by four distinct unions: 1) the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association;
2) the Boston Police Superior Officers Federation; 3) the Boston Police Detectives Benevolent Society; and
4) the Boston Police Detectives Benevolent Society, Superior Officers Unit. Firefighters and Fire Chiefs
are divided into two bargaining units represented by a single union: the International Association of
Firefighters Local 718.
Boston teachers, teacher aides, school nurses, and substitutes are in a collective bargaining unit
represented by the Boston Teachers Union, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO.
The Boston Public Schools and the City of Boston maintain a contract with a private vendor to
provide bus transportation for City of Boston students who require transportation. The personnel costs

A-9

under this contract are passed through to the City and the City participates in the collective bargaining
negotiations between the vendor and its employees.
The table below represents a summary of the bargaining units representing City employees, the
number of City employees represented by each bargaining unit, and the status of the City’s contract with
each bargaining unit.

(BAIS/HCM) and Boston School Department.

The City and Boston Public Schools have settled multi-year agreements with 84% of unions,
placing approximately 8,800 employees under contract. The City has settled contracts with all four sworn
police unions, the firefighters’ union, AFSCME, SEIU, and SENA. Those contracts are four years in
duration and include wage increases of 2% each year and other benefits. The agreement with the Boston
Teachers Union was for two years and expired in August 2018. The City continues discussions and
negotiations with the unions without settled agreements. The City expects to cover the costs of settled
contracts through the budgeted collective bargaining reserve.

FINANCIAL OPERATIONS
Budget Process
Operating Budget
The City’s fiscal year begins July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following calendar year. Pursuant to
state law, the Mayor must submit an operating budget to the City Council by the second Wednesday in
April for its review and approval. Proposed appropriations for all departments and operations of the City
(except for the public schools and public health services) are prepared under the direction of the Mayor in
the Office of Budget Management (“OBM”). The Superintendent of Schools must submit a budget to the
School Committee by the first Wednesday in February. The School Committee must approve a budget by
the fourth Wednesday in March and forward this budget to the Mayor who may approve or reduce the total
recommended budget. The Mayor then submits the school budget to the City Council for appropriation by
the second Wednesday in May. In practice, the School Department appropriation request has been
presented to the City Council in coordination with the Mayor’s operating budget request in April. The
BPHC must submit to the Mayor a revenue and expenditure budget for public health services by the second
Wednesday in March. If the proposed budget provides for expenditures in excess of the BPHC’s projected
revenues from non-City sources, the Mayor may either approve or reject the budget. If the Mayor accepts
the budget, the amount required to fund the revenue deficiency (the “net cost of public health services”) is
included in the annual budget for the City submitted to the City Council in April of each year. The BPHC
must adopt its public health services budget by the second Wednesday in June.
The City Council may reduce or reject any item in the Mayor’s budget but may not, except upon the
recommendation of the Mayor, increase or add an item. The City, Boston Public Health Commission and
School Department operating budgets for fiscal 2019 were approved by the City Council on June 27, 2018.
See “Financial Operations—Fiscal 2019 Budget.” After approval of the budget and until the property tax
rate is officially determined in mid-December, the Mayor may submit to the City Council such
supplementary appropriation requests as are deemed necessary, including supplemental amounts for the
School Department and the Boston Public Health Commission. The Mayor may also submit to the City
Council supplementary appropriation requests subsequent to the setting of the property tax rate provided
that an available source of revenue is identified. Under certain circumstances, the Mayor may, by executive
order, require expenditures to be limited to an amount less than the appropriated level.
In the event that the City enters a fiscal year without an approved operating budget, the City
continues departmental operations on a “one-twelfth” budget, as provided in the City Charter. Under the
one-twelfth budget process, (a) payrolls for regular employees cannot exceed the average monthly
expenditure of the last three months of the preceding fiscal year, (b) total liabilities incurred in any month
cannot exceed amounts spent for similar purposes during any one month of the preceding fiscal year, and
(c) monthly expenditures for new departments cannot exceed one-twelfth of their current fiscal year’s
estimated costs.
By law, the City must establish its property tax rate each year so that the resulting property tax levy
complies with the requirements of Proposition 2½. (For a discussion of Proposition 2½, see “City
Revenues—Property Taxes—Proposition 2½.”) The amount raised in the tax levy equals the sum of (a) the
aggregate of all amounts appropriated, granted or lawfully expended since the last annual tax levy and not
provided for, plus (b) all debt and interest charges on general obligation debt of the City maturing during
the fiscal year and not otherwise provided for, plus (c) all amounts necessary to satisfy final judgments,
plus (d) provision for certain prior years’ deficits, less (e) the aggregate of all non-property tax revenues
projected to be received in the City’s General Fund in amounts certified or approved by the Commonwealth
for tax rate purposes. In general, the City is required to raise in the tax levy a deficit incurred on a statutory
accounting basis in the prior year’s operating budget, or a deficit incurred in the property tax abatement
reserves.
The City of Boston maintains a program-based budgeting system to track expenditures and service
levels by major functions or “programs.” This budgeting system complies with the standards of the
Government Finance Officers Association, which has consistently recognized the City’s efforts with its
Distinguished Budget Presentation Award.
Capital Budget
The Office of Budget Management manages the City’s capital plan, including evaluating the
condition of the City’s capital assets, forecasting the timing and financial requirements of new construction
and rehabilitation, and assessing the allocation of current and future resources to meet the City’s
infrastructure needs. Through an annually updated five-year capital plan, the City refines its capital needs
A-12

and resources each fiscal year. In April 2018, the Mayor released the fiscal 2019-2023 capital plan and
initiated loan orders for City Council consideration. See “City Indebtedness – Capital Planning and
Borrowing Program - Current Capital Investment Plans” below for additional information. There is no
statutory time frame for requesting or approving such orders. All fiscal 2019 capital authorizations have
been approved by the City Council.
OBM also provides ongoing project oversight during the implementation phase of capital projects.
The City reviews and approves all capital contracts and monitors project costs and schedules to ensure the
adequacy of available funding sources in accordance with the capital plan.
Summary and Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary Basis)—Fiscal 2015 to 2018 Actual
Results and Fiscal 2019 Budget
The following table shows the City’s General Fund budget for fiscal 2019, together with budgetary
actual results for fiscal 2015 through 2018. In accordance with state law and regulations, the City’s General
Fund budget as shown below is prepared on the “budgetary basis” instead of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Among the key differences between these
two sets of accounting principles are that “budgetary” records property tax as it is levied while GAAP
records it as it becomes susceptible to accrual, “budgetary” records certain activities and transactions in the
General Fund that GAAP records in separate funds, “budgetary” records as an expenditure any amount
raised to cover a prior year deficit, and as a revenue any available funds drawn from accumulated prior year
surpluses, while GAAP ignores these impacts from prior years. “Budgetary” records encumbrances and
continuing appropriations as the equivalent of expenditures but has no effect on GAAP expenditures. The
difference in accounting principles inevitably leads to varying results in excess or deficiency of revenues
over expenditures.

Fiscal 2015-2017 Actual Results
During the fiscal 2015 to 2017 period, the City continued its pattern of producing annual budget
surpluses as shown in the prior table. During this period the City’s property tax base experienced notable
growth as commercial construction projects came online in fiscal 2016, combined with an increase in
residential development linked to Mayor Walsh’s housing production goals. More detail on these efforts
can be found in the Imagine Boston 2030 plan at https://www.imagine.boston.gov. Boston 2030 is a
strategic roadmap that focuses on housing affordability, new development, and the preservation of existing
housing units. Several properties also moved from tax-exempt to taxable status during this time period. In
addition, growth in local revenue was mainly driven by increases in local option taxes, i.e. room occupancy
tax and restaurant meal tax, motor vehicle excise tax, as well as growth in building permit revenue and
payments in lieu of taxes.
In fiscal 2015, the City’s expenditures totaled $2.77 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed costs, which increased $128.2 million or 4.8% from fiscal 2014
expenditures. Within the category of City Departments the Snow Removal budget deficit totaled $19.9
million with snow costs higher than estimated in the budget due to unprecedented snowfall. Total revenues
equaled $2.78 billion.
In fiscal 2016, the City’s expenditures totaled $2.88 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed costs, which increased $108.0 million or 3.9% from fiscal 2015
expenditures.
Within the category of City Departments, items to note are the Police and Fire appropriation deficits
totaling $19.5 million which were offset by a revenue surplus. These deficits are mainly the result of higher
than budgeted overtime expenses. Fiscal 2016 actual expenditures also reflect a deficit of approximately $7
million in the Execution of Courts account, resulting from a reserve set aside to pay for possible adverse
legal rulings. Total revenues equaled $2.88 billion.
In fiscal 2017, the City’s expenditures totaled $2.99 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed costs, which increased $109.0 million or 3.8% from fiscal 2016
expenditures. Fiscal 2017 actual expenditures compared with actual fiscal 2016 expenditures as follows:
City Departments increased $41.5 million or 3.6%; the Public Health Commission increased $1.1 million or
1.4%; the School Department increased $15.3 million or 1.5%. Actual fixed costs for fiscal 2017 compared
with actual fiscal 2016 fixed costs as follows: Pensions increased $2.8 million or 1.4%; Debt Service
increased $7.7 million or 4.9%; State Assessments increased $9.8 million or 4.2%; and Suffolk County
Sheriff was level with the prior year.
The fiscal 2017 budget included increased public safety overtime budgets resulting in a more
moderate overtime deficit of $4.6 million in the Police Department overtime budget, and a budget surplus
in the Fire Department budget for the first time in several years. The right-sizing of the public safety
overtime budget in fiscal 2017 reversed a pattern of large public safety overtime deficits that occurred in
fiscal 2016 and prior years.

Fiscal 2018 Actual Results
The following is a summary of the City’s fiscal 2018 actual results on a budgetary accounting basis.
Expenditures
Fiscal 2018 ended with a $21.2 million general fund budget surplus. While there was an
appropriations deficit of $34.5 million driven by deficits in public safety, snow removal and a reserve
established for legal judgements and settlements, these deficits were sufficiently covered by a $55.7 million
revenue surplus. In fiscal 2018, the City’s expenditures totaled $3.19 billion including direct expenditures
for departmental services and fixed costs, which increased $202.0 million or 6.8% from fiscal 2017
expenditures. Fiscal 2018 actual expenditures compared with actual fiscal 2017 expenditures are as
follows: City Departments increased $91.1 million or 7.6%; the Public Health Commission increased $2.3
million or 3.0%; the School Department increased $61.7 million or 6.0%. Actual fixed costs for fiscal 2018
compared with actual fiscal 2017 fixed costs are as follows: Pensions increased $34.0 million or 17.1%;

A-15

Debt Service increased $5.6 million or 3.4%; and State Assessments increased $23.7 million or 9.8%. The
larger increase in pension expenditures for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 is a result, in part, from a
$12 million additional payment having been made in fiscal 2018 above the scheduled payments.
The fiscal 2018 budget ended with deficits for public safety departments with the Police Department
having a $14.4 million deficit and Fire having a $1 million deficit. These deficits were primarily related to
overtime spending, but also reflect decisions made at year end to accelerate equipment purchases.
Additionally, there were deficits related to Snow Removal account at $5.6 million and Execution of Courts
account at $14.5 million resulting from a reserve set aside to pay for possible adverse legal rulings.

Revenues
Actual revenues for fiscal 2018 totaled $3.21 billion, an increase from fiscal 2017 actual revenues of
$216.5 million or 7.2%. Selected fiscal 2018 actual revenues compared with fiscal 2017 actual revenues as
follows: The Gross Property Tax Levy (including new growth) increased $130.5 million or 6.2%; Excises
increased $32.7 million or 17.2%; Chapter 121A revenues increased $25 million or 52.6%; Fines increased
by $300 thousand or 0.5%; Interest on Investments increased $13.1 million or 569.6%; voluntary Payment
In Lieu of Taxes (“PILOT”) revenues decreased $900 thousand or -1.7%; Licenses and Permits decreased
by $9.5 million or -11.3 %; and State Revenue increased $14.8 million or 3.5%. Non-recurring revenue was
not utilized in 2018.
The increase in Interest on Investments was a result of the continued movement of significant assets
out of non-interest bearing accounts associated with compensating balance agreements between the City
and its primary bank and into interest-bearing accounts. The increase in State Revenue was due to increases
in unrestricted general government aid and education aid. For more detailed information regarding State
Revenue, see “City Revenues—State Revenue.”
In both fiscal 2017 and 2018, the City was able to fund the appropriation to the Other Post
Employment Benefits (“OPEB”) Trust Fund using recurring revenue sources instead of Budgetary Fund
Balance, which is available for appropriation only after certification of its value by the Massachusetts
Department of Revenue.
Fiscal 2019 Budget
The following is a summary of expectations regarding the City’s fiscal 2019 budget on a budgetary
accounting basis. The figures cited below are comparisons to fiscal 2018 actual figures.
Expenditures
In fiscal 2019, the City’s budgeted expenditures total $3.32 billion including direct expenditures for
departmental services and fixed expenses, representing an increase of $123.3 million or 3.9% from fiscal
2018 actual expenditures. Budgeted fiscal 2019 departmental expenditures compare with fiscal 2018
expenditures are as follows: City Departments increase $42.2 million or 3.3%. In fiscal 2019 the growth in
City Departments is based on several factors including the settlement of several outstanding collective
bargaining agreements with budgetary transfers from the collective bargaining reserve. The cost growth for
employee benefits like health insurance and Medicare contributions are reflected in City Departments in
fiscal 2019.
School Department budgeted expenditures increase $20.0 million or 1.8%. This growth currently
does not include the costs of a successor collective bargaining agreement with the Boston Teachers Union
that expired in August 2018. The School Department continues to experience expenditure pressure
particularly in the area of student transportation and the increasing costs related to a high needs student
population but will continue to explore cost reduction measures. The School Department is not currently
anticipating a budget deficit in fiscal 2019.
The Collective Bargaining Reserve increases by $2.5 million which reflects funding of
outstanding successor union contracts for City Departments, the Boston Public Health Commission, and
the School Department.
The appropriation to the OPEB Trust Fund is level-funded at $40.0 million. Budgeted fixed expenses
for fiscal 2019 compares with fiscal 2018 actual expenditures as follows: Pensions increase $8.8 million or
3.8%; Debt Service increases $19.4 million or 11.4%; and State Assessments increase $24.1 million or
9.1%. The smaller increase in pension expenditures for fiscal 2019 as compared to the fiscal 2018 is a
result of an additional pension payment of $12 million made in fiscal 2018 in excess of the amount required
by the schedule approved by the Boston Retirement Board.

A-16

Pension expenses are mandated by the City’s pension funding schedule and are a legal obligation of
the City. For more on Pensions, see “Employee Benefits—Retirement Systems.” State assessments are
also mandatory; the amounts are determined by the Commonwealth. Most of the increase in State
Assessments is for charter school tuition totaling $24.1 million, followed by the assessment to the City for
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (“MBTA”) service increasing by $2.4 million.
Revenues
Budgeted revenues for fiscal 2019 are expected to total $3.32 billion, an increase of $102.1 million or
3.2% from fiscal 2018 actual revenues.
Selected fiscal 2019 budgeted revenues compare with fiscal 2018 actual revenues as follows: The
budgeted Gross Property Tax Levy (including new growth) increases $127.3 million or 5.7%; in fiscal
2019, the City has reserved 1.4% of the gross levy for abatements, the same percentage as in fiscal 2018.
Fines increase $5.3 million or 8.3%; Interest decreases $10.4 million or -67.5%; Payments in Lieu of Taxes
decrease $6.7 million or -12.7%; Chapter 121A revenues decrease $45 million or -62.1%; Misc.
Department Revenues decrease by $8.3 million or -12.3%; Licenses and Permits decrease $8.3 million
or -11.1%; Penalties and Interest decrease by $2.4 million or -21.0%; State Aid increases by $7.3 million or
1.7% and Non-Recurring Revenue increases by $55 million to fund the OPEB Trust Fund and to provide
one-time funding from the sale of a former City-owned parking garage to establish maintenance trusts for
the Boston Common, Franklin Park and the Emerald Necklace.
The growth in budgeted Property Tax is due to the allowable increase of the City's levy by 2.5% and
strong new growth that is excluded from the levy limit. New growth is projected at $77.3 million in fiscal
2019. The Property Tax, the City’s largest source of revenue, has become increasingly important to the
City’s revenue growth given the recent fluctuations in state aid from the Commonwealth—the City’s
second largest single source of revenue, see “City Revenues—State Aid.” The City has always increased
the Property Tax levy annually by the maximum amount allowed under statutory limits.
The decrease in budgeted Excises, Interest, Payments in Lieu of Taxes, Penalties and Interest
and Misc. Department Revenue is largely due to conservative revenue estimates across all categories.
Chapter 121A revenue declined as expiring 121A projects converted to property taxes. The decrease in
Licenses and Permits is due to a conservative estimate of building permit revenue. The increase in Fines is
due to increases in parking fines. The increase in State Aid is due to increases in the Unrestricted General
Government Aid and Chapter 70 Education Aid. For more detailed information regarding State Aid, see
“City Revenues—State Aid.”
It is expected that in fiscal 2019 the City of Boston will meet its revenue budget in the aggregate and
will have sufficient revenue to support emergency spending for snow removal and other public safety costs.
Federal Sequestration
Certain federal funding received by the City has been and is expected to be adversely affected by
continued implementation of sequestration, which began on March 1, 2013.
The City has issued general obligation bonds in the form of Build America Bonds (“BABs”),
Qualified School Construction Bonds (“QSCBs”), and Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds
(“RZEDBs”) (collectively, the “Tax Benefited Bonds”), under the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 (“ARRA”). Pursuant to ARRA, the City is entitled to receive cash subsidy payments from the
federal government, provided the City makes certain required filings in accordance with applicable federal
rules. Such interest subsidy payments are treated under federal law as overpayments of tax and,
accordingly, are subject to offset against certain amounts that may be owed by the City to the federal
government or its agencies. The City has issued approximately $126.6 million aggregate principal amount
of Tax Benefited Bonds, of which $118.0 million is currently outstanding.
The Internal Revenue Service, under the Budget Control Act of 2011, has released notifications to the
City since March 2013, stating that such interest subsidy payments are affected by sequestration reduction
rates for fiscal 2013 through 2019; the projected loss in cash subsidy payments in fiscal 2019 is expected to
be approximately $210,000. The City is obligated to make payments of principal and interest on the Tax
Benefited Bonds whether or not it receives interest subsidy payments and is able to adjust for federal
reductions under sequestration with available funding in debt service accounts. The City does not currently
believe that any reduction of cash subsidy payments will have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition or its ability to pay debt service on its Tax Benefited Bonds. All subsidy payments are expected
to be subject to sequestration reductions through federal fiscal 2025, the rates to be set from time to time.

A-17

Fiscal 2020 and 2021 Forecasts
At the time of publishing of fiscal 2019 adopted budget, the City projected budget deficits in fiscal
2020 and fiscal 2021 of $12.4 million in fiscal 2020 and $30.5 million in fiscal 2021. These projected
shortfalls in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 are driven in large part by growth in fixed costs, which are
expected to increase by approximately 6.1% in fiscal 2020, and costs related to collective bargaining
agreements. Within the City’s fixed costs, the Office of Budget Management continues to project
increasing Charter School tuition assessment, moderately growing debt service, and scheduled pension cost
increases. The forecast projected conservative revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 2021, with strong
property tax, moderate local receipts and stagnant local aid growth.
Since the publication of the forecasts, the fiscal 2019 property tax new growth revenue was certified
higher than projected, which will assist in closing the gaps for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021. Through the
fiscal 2020 budget process, the City will update revenue and fixed costs assumptions with new information
and will take steps to reduce department costs.
While the City will be making a fiscal 2020 revenue assumptions related to the marijuana local option
tax that was passed in December 2017 and state legislation approved in December 2018 related to shortterm rentals impacting the hotel rooms occupancy excise, such assumptions have not yet been finalized and
have not been confirmed as material sources of revenue for fiscal 2020.
The City has given guidance to Boston Public Schools that it can expect to see a fiscal 2020
appropriation totaling $1,138.5 billion which is approximately $26.2 million or 2.4% more than the current
fiscal 2019 appropriation. The City is actively working with the Boston Public Schools on developing the
final Fiscal 2020 appropriation. The City expects to establish a collective bargaining reserve in fiscal 2020
that would include estimates for contract settlements for Boston Public School unions including the Boston
Teachers Union. The costs associated with the union contract settlements will eventually be transferred to
the Boston Public Schools’ budget as the union contracts are settled. Boston Public Schools submitted a
balanced budget proposal for fiscal 2020 to the School Committee for its review in early February 2019 for
adoption by the end of March 2019.
The City will also continue to pursue opportunities to maximize increases to state education aid
revenue, and achieve savings initiatives uncovered through departmental operational audits.
Financial Statements
The City engages independent certified public accountants to audit and report on its financial
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. An
external Audit Committee, appointed by the Mayor, monitors the progress of the annual audit, reviews the
recommendations of the accounting firm and reports the Committee’s activities and recommendations to
the Mayor and the City Council.
The City’s audited financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The accounts of the City are organized
on the basis of funds. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a set of self-balancing accounts
that comprise its assets, liabilities, deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources, net
position/fund balance, revenues and expenditures/expenses. For a discussion of the significant accounting
policies employed in preparing the City’s fiscal 2018 audited financial statements, see Note 2 to such
audited financial statements, which are attached hereto as Exhibit I. The City’s fiscal 2018 financial
statements received an unmodified opinion.
GAAP accounting differs from the “statutory” accounting or “budgetary” accounting basis prescribed
by the Bureau of Accounts of the Commonwealth, for the annual budget and property tax certification
process. The major differences are explained in Note 4 to the fiscal 2018 audited financial statements,
attached hereto as Exhibit I.
Attached hereto as Exhibit II are Schedules of Comparative Financial Statements for the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014, which have been prepared by the City’s Auditing
Department based on information taken from the City’s audited financial statements for those fiscal years.

The following is a summary analysis of the City’s financial operations on a GAAP basis over the
period fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2018. The figures appearing in this section for the period are derived from
the City’s audited annual financial statements. The analyses of revenues and expenditures in the text that
follows are stated using data derived from the audited financial statements. For an explanation of the
differences between the GAAP basis and budgetary basis of accounting, see the audited financial
statements at Exhibit I, Note 4, “Budgetary Data.”
The City’s major recurring revenue sources during this period were real and personal property taxes,

City of Boston Treasury Department.

Financial Administration
Pursuant to state law mandates and policy initiatives, the City has established a system of internal
management controls. These controls are designed to maximize revenue collections, monitor operating and
capital spending, evaluate infrastructure needs, and enhance the City’s internal control in business
procedures. Major components of the City’s system of financial management controls include:
Revenue Collections
The City has implemented a comprehensive accounts receivable management program that
coordinates the collection of departmental revenues. The City has afforded taxpayers the ability to remit
payment for licenses, permits, fees, and fines with credit and debit cards and has given taxpayers an
alternative choice in paying real estate taxes by use of online direct debit or credit card payments. The City
secures its statutory lien for delinquent real estate taxes with instruments recorded at the Suffolk County
Registry of Deeds (“tax takings”). For more information concerning tax takings and collection of
delinquent real estate taxes, see “City Revenues—Property Taxes—Delinquent Taxes and Tax Title.”
Debt Management
The Treasury Department manages all City borrowings. The Treasury Department focuses on the
timing of borrowings to take advantage of favorable market conditions and manages the City’s cash flows
to help obviate the need for short-term borrowings for operating purposes. The Treasury Department has
established a series of debt management guidelines and has instituted a debt policy that directs the City’s
approach toward its debt management activities, including rapid debt repayment, the use of a debt capacity
model for establishing debt affordability, limitations on the level of variable rate debt the City will employ,
if any, maintenance of the relationship between debt and repayment sources, and responding to and
communicating with the financial community and the rating agencies. The City has no outstanding variable
rate debt.
Financial Management
Financial management is supported through the use of the Boston Administrative Information
Systems (“BAIS”). BAIS is an integrated financial and human capital management system that is designed
to track and control daily activities and report the financial position of the City. BAIS performs the
specialized functions of encumbrance control, budget control, position management, payroll allotment
reporting, fund accounting, and capital project and grant management. Real time edits prohibit excessive
commitments and overspending, while on-line access to information, including monthly revenue and
expenditure reports, allows department managers to evaluate directly the financial status of individual

A-21

programs and the entire department. The utilization of these systems supports the rigorous monitoring and
reporting requirements enforced by the City.
The City of Boston has consistently received unmodified opinions on the audit of its Basic Financial
Statements and has been presented with a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting
from the Government Finance Officers Association for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
(“CAFR”) since fiscal 1995. In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, a governmental unit
must publish an easily readable and efficiently organized CAFR. The CAFR must satisfy both GAAP and
applicable state and local legal requirements.
Investment Policy
The City has adopted and annually reviews and updates its investment policy statement that dictates
the types of investments made by the City Treasury of City funds, trust funds and other special funds for
which the City Treasury is responsible. In February 2019, the City adopted an updated policy governing its
investment of operating and reserve cash. The adopted investment policy continues to focus on the balance
of safety, liquidity, and yield determined most appropriate for the particular invested funds. Bond proceeds,
in conformance with the City’s policy, are invested in liquid, high-quality fixed-income investments.
Performance Management and Program Evaluation
Boston's performance management efforts, driven in partnership between the Citywide Analytics
Team and the Budget Office, exist to ensure that the City delivers the most effective and efficient services
possible. Building the tools to understand how well the City is performing, helping identify obstacles to
success, and developing immediate and potential long-term performance and process improvements create
lasting improvements for the City.
These efforts are summarized in CityScore and are designed to inform the Mayor, City managers, and
the public about the quality of life and the performance of City government by aggregating key
performance metrics into one number.
Boston About Results continues to be the City's sustainable and reliable performance management
system which captures the core functions of City departments and citywide strategic goals, assists in the
decision-making process, identifies areas of improvement, and effectively communicates performance
results to a broad range of stakeholders.
Risk Management
The City’s Risk Management strategy focuses on reducing the costs of third party liabilities, worker
injuries, employee health care costs, and property damages, through internal claims management,
department accountability, and a structured self-insurance program.
Tort liabilities are capped per M.G.L. Chapter 258, and Corporation Counsel defends the City in any
lawsuits that arise from the normal course of operations. Civilian workplace injuries are managed through
the City’s Workers’ Compensation Program. Police and Fire Departments manage their uniformed injury
programs under M.G.L. Chapter 42 Section 111F. These costs are budgeted and funded through the
General Fund. Departments are charged for their share of costs in order to promote awareness and
prevention efforts. Effective February 2019 the City, consistent with amendments to M.G.L. Chapter 149
Section 6 ½, will be required to maintain workplace safety standards consistent with those set by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
Health benefits for over 30,000 City employees and retirees are managed by the Health Benefits
Program. 100% of the City’s share of health benefit costs are self-insured through internal service funds
established in compliance with M.G.L. Chapter 32B Section 3A. Actuarially determined reserves are
maintained in the Funds to stabilize rate increases and protect against large claims or cost increases.
Building damages are managed by individual departments, assisted by the Public Facilities
Department. Large damages are insured through a catastrophic property insurance policy, which provides
$100.0 million for all risk protection after a $10.0 million deductible, with a lower $1,000 deductible for
fine arts. An additional boiler and machinery insurance policy provides up to $25.0 million per incident.
For unexpected large costs in all categories just described, the City maintains a catastrophic risk
reserve, which had an available balance of $26.1 million at the end of fiscal 2018.
Energy Management
The Chief of Environment, Energy and Open Space and Chief Financial Officer are charged with
making decisions regarding the City’s procurement, use, and conservation of energy. In addition, the Chief
of Environment, Energy and Open Space monitors the City’s progress in meeting the greenhouse gas
A-22

reduction goals required by the City’s Climate Action Plan. The Municipal Energy Unit housed within the
Environment, Energy and Open Space Cabinet works with City departments and the Office of Budget
Management to develop design standards and implement measures that enhance the energy efficiency of
the City’s new construction and capital improvement projects.
The City has achieved operational savings through the conversion of street lights to newer fixtures
using Light Emitting Diode (“LED”) technology.
In fiscal 2019, the City began implementing improvements which will result in utility cost savings for
City facilities, under an initiative entitled “Renew Boston Trust.” This initiative is not a trust in the
traditional sense, but a program to bundle municipal utility cost savings projects. The initial step of having
an Energy Service Company (“ESCO”) conduct an Investment Grade Audit (“IGA”) of the City’s facilities
portfolio to identify projects with significant utility savings potential has been completed. The City selected
projects based upon the IGA analysis and is implementing the program through a contract with the ESCO
that provides long-term financial guarantees on the net savings for such projects. The budget for a second
phase of RBT has been authorized and work on planning the second phase is beginning. The City plans to
finance the program with general obligation bonds with debt service expected to be offset by the long-term
energy savings guaranteed by the ESCO.
To improve the tracking and control of energy use, the City has re-procured services to support an
Enterprise Energy Management System (“EEMS”). The current EEMS enables the City to monitor and
report on the energy consumed by its 314 buildings and other fixed assets, and its vehicle fleet, and is used
by the City to meet its public reporting obligation under the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure
Ordinance. The EEMS has enabled the identification of energy efficiency projects through the Renew
Boston Trust program that are expected to generate approximately $780,000 in savings in the first year
after implementation is complete. The EEMS has also resulted in the identification and recovery of utility
billing errors credited back to the City in excess of $1.3 million over the term of the contract.
The City’s electricity requirements have been met by third-party commodity supply contractors since
March 2005. To date, the amounts the City has paid to its third-party electricity suppliers have been less
than the amounts it would have paid if it had continued to accept default electric service from its local
distribution company.
Other Matters
Cyber Threats
As is the case with many organizations, the City of Boston faces continuing exposure to cyber risk with
respect to its information technology infrastructure. These cyber threats come in a number of forms but
most commonly present themselves as denial of service attacks, phishing and spear phishing attempts,
ransomware attacks and malware. While the City has not yet experienced any attacks that have impacted
liquidity or affected its business operations in any extended, meaningful way, it continues to take steps to
attempt to protect itself against what are expected to be continued threats. These steps include employee
trainings focused on how to identify spear phishing and phishing emails, the importance of protecting and
creating strong passwords, and the protection and storing of sensitive data. The City also applies a multilayered security approach, including two factor authentication in which it maintains multiple lines of
defense in each layer of its technology architecture and has adopted best practices such as those
recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework and the
Center for Internet Security 20 Critical Controls. In the event of an attack, the City has an incident response
policy in place. Further, the City maintains an incident response retainer with cyber security third parties
and remains in contact with federal, state and local agencies to provide best practices and support in the
case of a serious cyber attack. Nonetheless, the City cannot assure that future incidents or possible
unknown prior events will not have a material impact on the City’s operations or financial condition.
The Opioid Epidemic
The opioid epidemic has impacted every region of the United States and in recent years has grown
worse in the City of Boston. In cases handled by the City’s Emergency Medical Services (“EMS”), deaths
from opioid overdoses increased 54% in calendar year 2017 as compared with calendar year 2016, and the
total number of cases involving opioids handled by EMS increased from 2,879 in 2016 to 3,619 in 2017.
The City of Boston is investigating the impact that the recent opioid epidemic has had on (1) direct costs
incurred by the City, such as police, fire and emergency medical services, (ii) indirect costs such as
increased homelessness, underemployment and SF-8 unemployment (resulting in the payment of
unemployment benefits), and increased crime and (iii) potential lost revenue to the City. The total cost to
the City is substantial and appears to be rising. At this time the cost is not anticipated to affect materially
A-23

the City’s financial condition. The City has filed suit in Suffolk Superior Court against various
manufacturers, distributors, and prescribers to recover damages and to enjoin their actions which have led
to the present crisis.

CITY REVENUES
The principal sources of City revenue available to meet operating expenditures are property taxes,
state revenue, excise revenues, departmental revenues, and federal and state grants, all of which are
described below. Except as specifically noted, all amounts are stated on a budgetary accounting basis.
Property Taxes
Real and personal property taxes are the largest single source of the City’s revenue. The City’s gross
property tax levy for fiscal 2019 equals $2.35 billion, or 70.8% of City General Fund revenues of $3.32
billion budgeted for such period. Certain properties are subject to arrangements that suspend the imposition
of real property taxes at normal rates in order to encourage development. See “City Revenues—Property
Taxes—Revenues from Chapter 121A Corporations” below.
As discussed below, Proposition 2½ limits the level of property taxation in the City. In fiscal 2019,
the City has again levied taxes below the 2.5% ceiling on the overall effective tax rate. The City is not
expected to reach the levy ceiling in the foreseeable future due to previous growth in the real estate market.
Proposition 2½
Proposition 2½ is a statewide tax limitation subject to amendment or repeal by the legislature that
imposes two separate limits on the annual tax levy of a city or town. The primary limitation of Proposition
2½ is that the property tax levy in any city or town in the Commonwealth cannot exceed 2.5% of the full
and fair cash valuation of the taxable real estate and personal property in that city or town (the “2½
ceiling”). The only exception is the temporary exclusion of debt service or capital costs from the levy
ceiling restrictions, as described below.
Within the limits of the 2½ ceiling, the Growth Levy Limit is a secondary limitation imposed by
Proposition 2½. The Growth Levy Limit prohibits the levy in a fiscal year from exceeding an amount equal
to 102.5% of the maximum allowable limit for the preceding year, subject to exceptions for the following:
property newly added to the tax rolls and valuation increases other than as a result of a general revaluation
(“new growth”); temporary exclusions from the tax levy limitation to pay for capital costs or debt service
on indebtedness; and “overrides,” which are permanent increases in the tax levy for general expenditures of
the city or town. Exclusions and overrides must be approved by a referendum of the voters of the city or
town. The levy is permanently increased by the addition of new growth and overrides, except that any
override to fund a stabilization fund will not be taken into account in calculating the maximum levy limit in
subsequent fiscal years unless the City Council votes to appropriate such increased amount in such
subsequent year to the stabilization fund. The exclusion of debt service by referendum temporarily
increases the levy amount and the duration of the specific debt excluded. The Growth Levy Limit may be
exceeded by an override in any year by a majority vote of the voters. An increase in the Growth Levy Limit
under this procedure, however, does not permit a tax levy in excess of the 2½ ceiling since the two
limitations apply independently. The applicable tax limits may also be reduced in any year by a majority
vote of the voters. The City’s gross levy in fiscal 2019 equals $2.35 billion. In fiscal 2019, the allowable
2.5% increase is $55.5 million, and “new growth” is $77.3 million.
In order to mitigate its adverse impact on local government revenues, Proposition 2½ limits the
annual rate of increase of aggregate, statewide assessments made upon cities and towns by the
Commonwealth and certain of its governmental entities, such as assessments made upon the City and
certain other cities and towns for the MBTA, to 2.5% of the prior year’s assessment. Proposition 2½ also
limits the motor vehicle excise tax rate to 2.5%.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Proposition 2½ described above, the City’s Bond Procedure Act of
1983 mandates assessment of taxes in excess of the Proposition 2½ levy limits to the extent that the debt
service on City obligations is not otherwise provided for in the tax levy or from other sources, with no
allowance made for any other expenditures of the City. See “City Indebtedness—Classification of City
Debt.”

Revaluation
Previously, state law mandated a revaluation of all taxable property every three years. The Municipal
Modernization Act was signed into law on August 9, 2016 which changed the revaluation schedule to every
five years, after an initial “ramp-up” period. The next revaluation is scheduled for fiscal 2020. These
revaluations are reviewed and certified by the Commonwealth. In the years between revaluations, the
Commonwealth requires municipalities to establish new values on the basis of market changes, using the
most recent revaluation as a basis. The City has adjusted certified property values in accordance with this
procedure in years when market conditions indicated such adjustment was necessary.
In November 2015, the City concluded work on its last scheduled revaluation for fiscal 2016, with an
assessment date of January 1, 2015. The next revaluation is scheduled for fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2019,
assessments are based on market activity leading up to the assessment date of January 1, 2018. Fiscal 2019
assessments reflected an active real estate market with assessed values in most neighborhoods having
increased over the prior year.
Taxation by Use; Tax Rates
The property tax base in the City consists of personal property and classes of real estate. The
following table shows the classes of taxable real property assessed as of January 1, 2018. The fiscal 2019
tax rates were applied to the January 1, 2018 valuation to determine levy and tax liability for fiscal 2019.

City of Boston Assessing Department.

The City utilizes five classes of property for taxation purposes: (i) residential, (ii) open space land,
(iii) commercial, (iv) industrial, and (v) personal property. Within limits under state law, the City may
determine the share of the annual levy to be borne by each of the categories. Under these statutory limits,
the residential tax rate cannot be given a discount greater than 50%, while the tax rate on the remaining
business classes of property cannot exceed 175% of the overall effective tax rate.
The City may also exempt a portion of the assessed valuation of residential real property when used
as the taxpayer’s principal residence. A change in state law allowed the City to increase the amount of the
residential exemption from up to 30% to 35% of the average assessed value of all residential property
starting in fiscal 2018. This larger residential exemption is expected to continue to be applied to all fiscal
years in the future. For fiscal 2019, each qualifying resident who receives the residential exemption has
their taxable assessed value reduced by $257,978. The residential exemption only has an impact on the
residential rate.

City of Boston Assessing Department.

The City of Boston’s Assessing Department is responsible for the generation of revenue for the City
through the valuation of personal and real property. To that end, the Assessing Department uses a number
of systems to assist with the acquisition, disposition, and assessment of property records.
The Assessing department has executed a contract with Patriot Properties (“Patriot”) for a new
computer-assisted mass appraisal (“CAMA”) system. Collaborative work with Patriot is ongoing for the
conversion of existing data and to simulate current valuation functions. The Assessing department expects
to bill the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2020 from the Patriot CAMA system.

A-27

Although there is a potential for disruption during the migration of valuation data from the legacy
system to the new Patriot system, the department is taking steps to mitigate any issues. The Assessing
department has hired a project manager to help manage this process and ensure that there is a smooth
transfer of data. Patriot is the department’s current vendor for the existing personal property system. It is
expected that the department will gain greater efficiencies by merging what are currently two separate
systems into one. The department will run a dual system entry for a period of time to ensure that data is
accurately translating to the new CAMA system before full transition occurs. Additionally, the
Massachusetts Department of Revenue requires a comprehensive review of records during a CAMA
conversion process to ensure data accuracy. While methodically working to prevent such an occurrence,
associated risks include the department’s continuing to bill the fiscal 2020 property values out of the legacy
system, and pushing the conversion into fiscal 2021.
The following table is a list of all of the taxpayers in the City that had an aggregate tax liability in
excess of $15.0 million for fiscal 2019. Assessed valuations and fiscal 2019 taxes reflect the valuation of
property as of January 1, 2018 and the tax liability using applicable tax rates.

The Largest Taxpayers table includes entities with a fiscal year 2019 tax liability greater than $15.0 million. The methodology used in
creating the table involves the search of the title holder(s) of all major parcels of property in the City. This methodology does not
necessarily locate all parcels owned by affiliates nor does it differentiate between percentage ownership in a particular parcel.

(2)

Pursuant to Chapter 59 of the General Laws, Section 4, personal property consists of movable physical items not permanently attached to
real estate. Many items of personal property are exempt from taxation in Massachusetts. There are three general types of personal
property that are taxable: business and professional furnishings, machinery used in the conduct of business, and personal property of
public utilities.

The City’s property tax bills are mailed quarterly in July, October, December, and April. The bills
mailed in July and October represent preliminary tax bills each equal to one quarter of the previous fiscal
year’s liability. The fair cash value of the property or assessment for the purpose of determining the new
fiscal year tax liability is reflected in the third and fourth quarter bills, which are mailed in December and
April. See “City Revenues—Property Taxes—Taxation by Use; Tax Rates.”
Delinquent Taxes and Tax Titles
Real and personal property taxes (not including motor vehicle, the room occupancy and the aircraft
fuel excises) are based on values established by the Assessing Department as of each January 1, and are due
in quarterly payments every August, November, February and May. Delinquent real estate and personal
property taxes are subject to a 14% per annum interest charge. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year in
which real estate taxes become delinquent, the City secures its lien for such taxes by taking legal title to all
delinquent properties, subject to the owners’ right of redemption. After this process, known as a “tax
taking,” is complete, interest accrues on outstanding amounts of delinquent real estate taxes at the rate of
16% per annum. If the taxes remain unpaid for a period of six months from the tax taking, the City may
petition the Land Court to foreclose the equity owner’s right of redemption. Upon foreclosure, the City may
then sell the property in order to liquidate the tax liability. The City estimates that the value of the
properties to which such tax titles are attached is substantially less than the amount of delinquent taxes,
charges, and interest owed.
Tax title receipts were $21.0 million, $17.9 million, and $11.3 million in fiscal 2016, 2017, and 2018,
respectively.
Revenues from Chapter 121A Corporations
A local government in cooperation with its redevelopment authorities may suspend the imposition of
real property taxes at normal levels on properties determined to be “blighted” in order to encourage
redevelopment of such properties by special corporations organized under Chapter 121A (“Chapter 121A
Corporations”). The City receives two principal sources of revenue from Chapter 121A Corporations. The
first consists of Section 10 Excise for each Chapter 121A Corporation that are collected by the
Commonwealth and distributed to the City. The second form of revenue is 6A contract payments resulting
from agreements that may be entered into between the Chapter 121A Corporation and the City relating to
City services available to the development.
Revenues received by the City from Chapter 121A Corporations for the last five fiscal years are
shown in the following table.
In August 2015, The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) issued Statement No. 77
“Tax Abatement Disclosures.” The objective of this Statement is to make the nature and magnitude of a
government’s tax abatement transactions more transparent to a user of the financial statements. The City

A-29

enters into tax abatement agreements that meet the reporting requirements of GASB Statement No. 77. The
GASB No. 77 standard went into effect in fiscal 2017. See Note 7 to the City’s fiscal 2018 audited

Community Preservation Act
The Massachusetts Community Preservation Act (the “CPA”) permits municipalities that accept its
provisions to levy a surcharge on its real property tax levy and to receive state matching funds for the
acquisition, creation, preservation, rehabilitation and restoration of open space, historic resources and
affordable housing. The provisions of the CPA must be accepted by the voters of the municipality at an
election after such provisions have first been accepted by either a vote of the legislative body of the
municipality or an initiative petition signed by 5% of its registered voters.
A municipality may approve a surcharge of up to 3% of the real property tax levy, and it may accept
one or more exemptions to the surcharge under the CPA, including an exemption for low-income
individuals and families and for low and moderate-income senior citizens, an exemption for $100,000 of
the value of each taxable parcel of residential real property, and an exemption for commercial and
industrial properties in municipalities with classified tax rates. The surcharge is not counted in the total
taxes assessed for the purpose of determining the permitted levy amount under Proposition 2½ (see
“Proposition 2½” above). A municipality may revoke its acceptance of the provisions of the CPA at any
time after 5 years from the date of such acceptance and may change the amount of the surcharge or the
exemptions to the surcharge at any time, provided that any such revocation or change must be approved
pursuant to the same process as acceptance of the CPA.
Any municipality that accepts the provisions of the CPA will receive annual state matching grants to
supplement amounts raised by its surcharge on the real property tax levy. The state matching funds are
raised from certain recording and filing fees of the registers of deeds. Those amounts are deposited into a
state trust fund and are distributed to municipalities that have accepted the provisions of the CPA, which
distributions are not subject to annual appropriation by the state legislature. The amount distributed to each
city and town is based on a statutory formula which requires that 80% of the amount in the state trust fund
be used to match an equal percentage of the amount raised locally by each city and town, and that the
remaining 20% of the amount in the fund be distributed only to those municipalities that levy the maximum
3% surcharge based on a formula which takes into account equalized property valuation and population,
resulting in larger distributions to those communities with low valuations and small populations. The total
state distribution made to any municipality may not, however, exceed 100% of the amount raised locally by
the surcharge on the real property tax levy.
The amounts raised by the surcharge on real property taxes and received in state matching funds are
required to be deposited in a dedicated community preservation fund. Each municipality that accepts the
provisions of the CPA is required to establish a community preservation committee to study the community
preservation needs of the community and to make recommendations to the legislative body of the
municipality regarding the community preservation projects that should be funded from the community
preservation fund. Upon the recommendations of the committee, the legislative body of the municipality
may appropriate amounts from the fund for permitted community preservation purposes or may reserve
amounts for spending in future fiscal years, provided that at least 10% of the total annual revenues to the
fund must be spent or set aside for open space purposes, 10% for historic resource purposes and 10% for
affordable housing purposes.
The CPA authorizes municipalities that accept its provisions to issue bonds and notes in anticipation
of the receipt of surcharge revenues to finance community preservation projects approved under the

A-30

provisions of the CPA. Bonds and notes issued under the CPA are general obligations of the municipality
and are payable from amounts on deposit in the community preservation fund. In the event that a
municipality revokes its acceptance of the provisions of the CPA, the surcharge shall remain in effect until
all contractual obligations incurred by the municipality prior to such revocation, including the payment of
bonds or notes issued under the CPA, have been fully discharged.
The City accepted the CPA in November 2016 and set the rate at 1%. The City is utilizing CPA
revenues to help achieve its housing and economic goals of creating affordable housing units, restoring
parks and recreational open space, and preserving historical sites. The City collected $18.9 million in
revenues in fiscal year 2018. For fiscal 2019, the City estimates that it will receive approximately $19.5
million attributable to this surcharge with state matching funds in the amount of $3.6 million. In June 2018
the City appropriated $8 million to 35 projects including: 12 Historic Preservation projects, 3 Affordable
Housing projects, 13 Recreational Use and Open Space projects and 7 blended Historical Preservation and
Open Space Projects. In fiscal 2019 the City plans to appropriate approximately $34 million to additional
projects, most notably affordable housing projects.
State Revenue
State revenue from the Commonwealth comprises the second largest single revenue source to the
City’s General Fund after the Property Tax. Over the course of the previous decade, support to
municipalities from the Commonwealth has been consistently reduced.
The City experienced reductions in actual state revenue totaling $102.9 million or -20.8% between
fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2012. While state revenue began to recover in fiscal 2013 and 2014, state revenue
declined again in fiscal 2015 by $9 million due to the Commonwealth underfunding the charter school
reimbursement account. Since fiscal 2016 state revenue has again increased annually, driven by increases
in Unrestricted General Government Aid. However, net state aid – defined by total state revenue net of
state assessments including charter school assessment, MBTA, and others has continued to decline in fiscal
years 2016, 2017 and 2018 by $10.7 million, $6.5 million and $8.9 million, respectively. The City is
expecting another net state aid decline of $16.9 million in fiscal year 2019.
Distributions from the Commonwealth charter school reimbursement account are based on a formula
to provide transitional dollars to municipalities when a student leaves a district school for a charter school,
but this account is subject to appropriation. For the past four years the Commonwealth has underfunded the
charter school reimbursement account, which has resulted in approximately $12 million less in fiscal 2015,
approximately $17 million less in fiscal 2016, approximately $19 million less in fiscal 2017, approximately
$25 million in fiscal 2018 and a projected $28 million less in fiscal 2019 for Boston than full funding of the
formula would have provided.
In fiscal 2018, state revenue increased by $14.8 million, and it is budgeted to rise again by $7.2
million in fiscal 2019. Adjusting for these changes, the total loss in state revenue between fiscal 2008 and
fiscal 2019 (budgeted) amounts to $46.4 million or -9.4%.
The State Treasurer is empowered to deduct “assessments” from state revenue amounts appropriated
to the City. The largest of these assessments is now that for Charter School Tuition followed by that for
MBTA. Charter Schools are public schools, open to all students that apply, that are funded by “tuition,”
100% of which is paid by the students’ home or “sending” school district. A 2010 increase in the
legislatively imposed cap on charter school enrollments has caused this cost to grow rapidly. Under the
2010 legislation, the cap ceased increasing in 2017, and now Boston’s charter school assessment is capped
at 18% of net school spending. In 2016, a proposed ballot initiative to further increase the Commonwealth
charter school cap was not approved by voters.
Assessments also include smaller charges for various state-provided services, which may include debt
service paid by the Commonwealth on “qualified bonds” and any sums allocable to the Boston Water and
Sewer Commission or the City that are due and unpaid on debt issued to the Massachusetts Clean Water
Trust (“MCWT”), formerly the Massachusetts Water Pollution Abatement Trust. The City has no
“qualified bonds” outstanding and has never had an unpaid amount due to the MCWT.
“Net state aid” or total state revenue net of “assessments,” has declined more than state revenue due
to the rapidly increasing assessment for charter school tuition mentioned above. Between fiscal 2008 and
fiscal 2018, net state aid declined by $189 million or -51.9%. State Assessments are expected to increase to
$288.2 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $264.1 million in fiscal 2018.
Under the Massachusetts Constitution and state finance law, the State Treasurer has the authority to
delay the allotment of state revenue appropriations under certain circumstances. In addition, the statute

A-31

governing the distribution of school aid provides that such payments are due only to the extent that
sufficient funds are available.
State School Building Assistance
Under its school building assistance program, the Commonwealth provides grants to cities, towns and
regional school districts for school construction projects. Until July 26, 2004, the State Board of Education
was responsible for approving grants for school projects and otherwise administering the program. Grant
amounts ranged from 50% to 90% of approved project costs. Municipalities generally issued bonds to
finance the entire project cost, and the Commonwealth disbursed the grants in equal annual installments
over the term of the related bonds. Approved project costs included the interest expense incurred on debt
issued by a municipality to finance the school project.
Due to demand for school building assistance grants far exceeding available funds, the state
legislature created the Massachusetts School Building Authority (“MSBA”) in 2004 to finance and
administer the school building assistance program. The MSBA has assumed all powers and obligations of
the State Board of Education with respect to the program. In addition to certain other amounts, the
legislation dedicates a portion of Commonwealth sales tax receipts to the MSBA to finance the program.
Projects previously approved for grants by the State Board of Education are entitled to receive grant
payments from the MSBA based on the approved project cost and reimbursement rate applicable under the
prior law. As of February 1, 2019, the City expects to receive $7.6 million in grant payments to offset its
outstanding debt service on school projects approved for grants under the prior law at a reimbursement rate
of 90% of approved project costs. The MSBA has paid and is expected to continue to pay the remaining
amounts of the grants for such projects in annual installments to reimburse debt service on bonds issued by
the City to finance such projects. In fiscal 2020, the City will receive its final reimbursement payments for
projects approved prior to the creation of the MSBA.
In 2008, the MSBA promulgated regulations with respect to the application and approval process for
new projects. The reimbursement ranges between 40% and 80% of approved project costs. The MSBA
pays its share of approved project costs pursuant to a project funding agreement between the MSBA and
the municipality. The MSBA operates two main programs: the Core Program, which can include extensive
repairs, renovations, additions, and new school construction; and the Accelerated Repair Program (“ARP”)
which funds boiler, roof, and window/door replacement projects with a focus on the preservation of
existing assets through energy-efficient and cost-saving upgrades, which will result in direct operational
savings for school districts.
Currently, one City school project is in construction under the Core Program, two others are in early
stages of the Core Program process, and one project was recently completed. In 2018, the City entered into
a Project Funding Agreement (“PFA”) for the construction of a new facility for the Boston Arts Academy.
Through the PFA, the City will receive a grant totaling 70.36% of eligible project costs with a maximum
grant totaling $48.9 million. The new Boston Arts Academy building is expected to open for students in
September 2021. In September 2018, the new Dearborn STEM Academy in Roxbury opened for students,
and the City expects to receive a grant totaling 75.34% of eligible project costs up to a maximum amount of
$37.4 million for this project.
Since 2015, the MSBA Board has selected and the City has moved forward on 24 projects in the ARP
program. Thirteen projects are complete. Construction will begin on five projects in summer 2019; design
is underway on six other projects. Construction on these six projects is planned for summer 2020. All
together the ARP project budgets total $55.3 million of which up to $32.4 million may be eligible for
reimbursement by the MSBA. The City’s share of total project costs is approximately $22.9 million.
Excise Revenues
In addition to the major sources of revenue described above, the City receives various other types of
revenues. See “Financial Operations—Summary and Comparison of Operating Results (Budgetary
Basis)—Fiscal 2015 to 2018 Actual Results and Fiscal 2019 Budget.” The following is a description of
those and other significant excise revenue sources of the City.
Room Occupancy Excise
As is its option under state law approved in 1985, the City imposed a 4.0% local room occupancy
excise upon the transfer of occupancy of any room in a hotel, lodging house or motel. The Commonwealth
granted authority to municipalities in 2009 to increase the local option room occupancy excise up to 6.0%.
The City increased the local option room occupancy excise to 6.0%, effective October 1, 2009. The
Massachusetts Department of Revenue is responsible for collecting and remitting local option room

A-32

occupancy excise receipts to the City in arrears. The City’s room occupancy excise receipts totaled $89.1
million, $91.3 million, and $94.0 million in fiscal 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.
Aircraft Fuel Excise
The City also assesses an aircraft fuel excise upon the sale of jet fuel. The Commonwealth collects
this tax and distributes it to the City. The City’s aircraft fuel excise receipts totaled $36.8 million, $15.9
million, and $28.8 million in fiscal 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. A late payment for aircraft fuel
excise in the amount of $8.2 million was received in fiscal 2016 rather than when due in fiscal 2015, an
early payment in the amount of $3.8 million was received in fiscal 2016 rather than when due in fiscal
2017, and a late payment in the amount of $4.5 million was received in fiscal 2018 rather than when due in
fiscal 2017. Payments for fiscal year 2018 were all received on time.
Motor Vehicle Excise
The Commonwealth assesses an excise on the registration of motor vehicles, the proceeds of which
are received by the municipality where the vehicle is principally garaged. The excise is a uniform rate of
$25 per $1,000 of vehicle valuation. The City’s annual motor vehicle excise receipts totaled $67.7 million,
$52.1 million, and $66.9 million in fiscal 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. The majority of the increase
in fiscal 2018 over fiscal 2017 was attributable to late billing for the fiscal 2017 motor vehicle excise due to
the implementation of a new software system; this resulted in an increase in prior year receipts accounted
for as fiscal 2018 revenue.
Meals Excise
In 2009, the Commonwealth granted the option to municipalities to levy a 0.75% excise on locally
sold prepared food and beverages. The Massachusetts Department of Revenue is responsible for collecting
and remitting meals excise receipts to the City. The City’s annual meals excise receipts totaled $28.0
million, $29.2 million, and $30.9 million in fiscal 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.
Vehicular Rental Surcharge
The Commonwealth imposes a $10 surcharge on each vehicular rental transaction contract in the
City. The City’s annual share of vehicular rental surcharges totaled $1.6 million in each of the fiscal years
2016, 2017, and 2018.
Departmental Revenues
Several City departments generate significant revenues from fines, fees, charges and reimbursements.
Parking Fines
The City’s annual parking fine receipts totaled $57.8 million, $60.5 million, and $60.7 million in
fiscal 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. As of July 1, 2018 the City has increased some of its parking
fines, aiming to produce positive results by changing driver behavior and reducing congestion in high
traffic areas. Additional information on these efforts can be found in the Go Boston 2030 plan (see “City
Indebtedness—Capital Planning and Borrowing Program—Capital Investment Plans) as well as the Carbon
Free Boston report available at https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/carbon-free-boston.
Building Permit Fees
The Inspectional Services Department performs a variety of functions for which fees are imposed
such as the granting of building permits. The City’s annual building permit fees totaled $52.3 million,
$62.0 million, and $52.8 million in fiscal 2016, 2017, and 2018 respectively.
Municipal Medicaid Reimbursement
The Office of Budget Management oversees a vendor contract to collect federal reimbursements for
Medicaid eligible services provided through the Boston Public Schools. The City’s annual municipal
Medicaid reimbursement revenue totaled $8.2 million, $9.2 million, and $8.1 million in fiscal 2016, 2017,
and 2018, respectively.
Other Available Revenues
Under state law, proceeds of the sale of City facilities must be applied to the Surplus Property
Disposition Fund to be used to finance capital projects, unless the City Council, with the approval of the
Mayor, votes to credit to the General Fund the difference between the sale proceeds and the amount of debt
(both principal and interest) incurred in acquiring or improving the sold facility. As of June 30, 2018, there
was $29.7 million remaining in the Surplus Property Disposition Fund.

A-33

Grants
The City receives both federal and state grant funds, some of which are determined according to
formulas, and others that are awarded competitively. These monies are recorded in special revenue funds.
Federal Grants
Some major sources of federal grant funds in fiscal 2018 included: a Community Development Block
Grant (“CDBG”) Entitlement Program award of $25.4 million; a Home Investment Partnership Program
(“HOME”) award of $5.5 million; a Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (“HOPWA”)
award of $2.3 million and an Emergency Services Grant award of $2.0 million. The Department of
Neighborhood Development received an additional $26.4 million in federal competitive grants, mainly
related to the Continuum of Care Program.
Major sources of federal grant funds for programs of the Boston Public Schools included: a Title I
Elementary & Secondary Education Act of 1965 award of $38.1 million; Special Education Entitlement
Grant awards of $18.4 million; School Lunch Program and Summer Food Program awards of $34.3
million; and Title II teacher quality award of $3.9 million. The Boston Public Schools were also awarded
$16.2 million from a variety of other federal grant sources during the 2018 fiscal year. Total federal aid to
Boston Public Schools in fiscal 2018 was $110.9 million compared to $104.2 million in fiscal 2017.
The City received a five year $15.5 million award from the US Federal Highway Administration
National Infrastructure Investments Program for the Connect Historic Boston project.
State Grants
In addition to State Revenue, the City also receives state grants. In fiscal 2018, the Boston Police
Department received Community Services grant awards that totaled $7.9 million from the Massachusetts
Executive Office of Public Safety and Security.
Boston Public Schools were awarded approximately $1.9 million for early childhood, elementary and
secondary, and adult education. In addition, the state paid $25.0 million in Special Education
Reimbursement to the Boston School Department.

CITY INDEBTEDNESS
Classification of City Debt
Direct general obligation debt of the City is debt for which the City’s full faith and credit are pledged
and for the payment of which all taxable property in the City is subject to ad valorem taxation without limit
as to rate or amount. General obligation bonds of the City may also be secured in certain circumstances by
a pledge of specific City revenues. The special obligation debt of the City is debt which may be secured
solely by a pledge of specific revenues derived from a revenue-producing facility of the City or for the
payment of which the City’s obligation is subject to annual appropriation.
General Obligation Debt
On June 30, 2018, the City had outstanding approximately $1.32 billion of general obligation longterm bonds, all of which bear fixed rates of interest. On February 1, 2019, the City had approximately $1.31
billion of general obligation long-term bonds outstanding.
The City is authorized to secure any of its general obligation indebtedness by a pledge of all or any
part of any revenues of the City including, without limitation, any tax, such as real property taxes, any fees
payable to or for the account of the City, and certain receipts, distributions and reimbursements held or to
be received by the City from the Commonwealth. The City currently has no general obligation bonds or
notes outstanding secured by such a pledge.
Debt Limits
All debt of the City requires the authorization of the City Council and approval of the Mayor. If the
Mayor vetoes a loan order passed by the City Council, the charter of the City provides that the loan order is
void and may not be passed over the Mayor’s veto. Authorization of bonds under a loan order of the City
Council includes, unless otherwise provided, the authorization to issue temporary notes in anticipation of
such bonds.
The statutory debt limit for the City consists of a debt limit and a double debt limit. The debt limit is
5%, and the double debt limit is 10%, of the valuation of taxable property in the City as last equalized by
the State Department of Revenue. Biennially, prior to January 31st, the Commissioner of Revenue
establishes a final equalized valuation which is the basis for determining the debt limit for the following
two-year period or until another equalization has been established. The equalized valuation of taxable
property in the City established by the Commissioner of Revenue in January 2019 equals $179.79 billion.
Based on the current equalized valuation, the City’s debt limit equals approximately $8.99 billion, and its
double debt limit equals $17.98 billion as of February 1, 2019.
The City may authorize debt up to its debt limit without state approval. The City may authorize debt
over the debt limit up to the double debt limit with the approval of the Municipal Finance Oversight Board,
composed of the State Treasurer and Receiver-General, the State Auditor, the Attorney General and the
Director of Accounts. As of June 30, 2018, the City had outstanding debt of $1.23 billion subject to the
debt limit, and authorized but unissued debt subject to the debt limit of $896.9 million. As of February 1,
2019, the City had outstanding debt of $1.22 billion subject to the debt limit, and authorized but unissued
debt subject to the debt limit of $1.19 billion. Based on the City’s current debt limit of $8.99 billion, the
City had the statutory capacity to authorize an additional $6.58 billion of debt as of February 1, 2019.
In addition to statutory constraints, the City has imposed certain policy constraints on its issuance of
general obligation debt. Reviewed annually and subject to change, the City’s debt management policies
currently require the repayment of 40% of principal within five years and 70% of principal within 10 years.
Additionally, annual debt service may not exceed 7% of general fund expenditures and variable rate debt
outstanding may not comprise more than 20% of the City’s total debt portfolio. As of February 1, 2019,
City has no variable rate debt outstanding.

There are many categories of general obligation debt which are not subject to the debt limit and are
therefore not included in the Debt Incurring Capacity table above. Some such debt is, however, subject to
other debt limits, dollar limitations or state approval. As of February 1, 2019, the City had a total of $1.31
billion in long-term debt outstanding, of which $88.4 million was exempt from the debt limit. As of that
date the City also had $76.3 million of long-term debt that was authorized but unissued and exempt from
the debt limit.

The related revenues shown in the foregoing Debt Statement and table of Debt Service Requirements
are not pledged to the payment of specific indebtedness. However, such revenues may substantially reduce
the amount of tax or other revenues of the City that must be raised to pay debt service on the related debt.
The increase in gross debt service from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is a result of conservative budgeting
assumptions.

Short-Term Borrowings
Although the City is authorized to borrow for operating purposes through the issuance of short-term
notes in anticipation of revenue receipts, it has not done so in several years. In addition, the City is
authorized to issue short-term debt obligations or Bond Anticipation Notes (“BANs”) in anticipation of the
issuance of long-term bonds. Currently, no BANs are outstanding.
Special Obligation Debt
In addition to general obligation indebtedness, the Bond Procedure Act of 1983 and various other
special acts authorize the City to incur indebtedness which is secured by and payable solely from certain
revenues of the City which are pledged for the payment of such indebtedness or which are subject to annual
appropriation by the City for such purpose. As of February 1, 2019, the City has no special obligation debt.
Debt of Agencies Related to the City
In addition to general obligation and special obligation indebtedness of the City, the City and certain
agencies related to the City are authorized to issue debt which is solely an obligation of the agency or
which, although issued by the City, are payable solely from revenues derived from projects financed by
such debt. Except as indicated below, such obligations do not constitute a debt of the City.

A-38

Boston Water and Sewer Commission
The Boston Water and Sewer Commission (“BWSC”) is an independent body politic and corporate
and a political subdivision of the Commonwealth created in July 1977. The BWSC, among its other
powers, is authorized to operate and maintain the water and sewer systems of the City, construct
improvements to the systems, collect user charges for its services, and finance its activities and its
borrowing through its revenues. The City is not obligated on debt issued by the BWSC. The BWSC’s user
charges, as required by statute, are designed to produce revenues to the BWSC sufficient to pay all of its
current operating and capital expenses. These user charges are anticipated to increase moderately. The
City’s property tax base is not used to subsidize water and sewer services.
Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston
The Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston (“EDIC”) is a body politic and
corporate and an instrumentality of the Commonwealth with a board of five members, also appointed as the
members of the Boston Planning & Development Agency (“BPDA”). EDIC has a variety of powers to
assist industrial development projects in the City including the power to issue special obligation revenue
bonds to finance economic development projects in the City, which are solely the obligation of EDIC, or
the owner or lessee of the financed project. The City is also authorized to appropriate or borrow monies in
aid of EDIC development projects within certain urban renewal debt limitations.
Boston Planning and Development Agency
The Boston Redevelopment Authority (“BRA”) d/b/a Boston Planning and Development Agency
(“BPDA”) is a public body politic and corporate constituting the City’s redevelopment authority. It acts as
the City’s planning board and exercises certain powers of the state Department of Housing and Community
Development. The BPDA board consists of four members appointed by the Mayor, subject to confirmation
by the City Council, and one appointed by the state Department of Housing and Community Development.
The staff includes architects, economists, engineers, lawyers and urban planners, as well as management
personnel and administrative support. The BPDA provides the planning support for major construction,
development and redevelopment activity in the City. Although the BPDA is authorized to issue revenue
bonds and notes which would not constitute indebtedness of the City, BPDA projects have traditionally
been financed through a combination of federal and state grants, the proceeds of general obligation bonds
issued by the City and revenues from the lease or sale of land.
Boston Public Health Commission
The Boston Public Health Commission is a body politic and corporate and a political subdivision of
the Commonwealth created in June 1996 as the successor to the City’s Department of Health and Hospitals.
See “The City—Principal Government Services—Public Health.” The BPHC is responsible for the
implementation of public health programs in the City and serves as the board of health of the City. In
addition to its other powers, the BPHC is authorized by its enabling act, with the approval of the City
Council and the Mayor, to borrow money for any of its corporate purposes from the City or from the
Massachusetts Health and Educational Facilities Authority. Debt of the BPHC is not a debt or other
obligation of the City. The BPHC has no debt currently outstanding.
The BPHC is also obligated to reimburse the City for debt service paid on all outstanding general
obligation bonds of the City issued for public health and hospital purposes, which was paid in full in prior
fiscal years. The BPHC has required, and can be expected to continue to require, substantial financial
support from the City to maintain its public health mission and programs, including satisfaction of its
obligations described above.
Other Agencies and Corporations
Two other public bodies are empowered, either by themselves or through the City, to issue special
obligation revenue bonds. The Boston Housing Authority (“BHA”) is responsible for the construction,
financing and operation of residential housing for low-income persons. While the City provides certain
municipal services to BHA developments, and capital expenditures for City infrastructure related to those
developments, the City is not directly or indirectly liable for operating or debt service expenses of the
BHA. The City, acting by and through the Boston Industrial Development Financing Authority, is
authorized to issue revenue bonds to finance the construction of industrial, commercial and pollutioncontrol facilities. The City has also traditionally provided financial assistance to a number of nonprofit
corporations organized to provide and conduct civic and charitable functions for residents and visitors to
the City and to stimulate the economic development of the City.

A-39

In addition, two nonprofit corporations, the Dudley Square Realty Corporation (“DSRC”) and the
Ferdinand Building Development Corporation (“FBDC”), were formed by the City in October 2011 in
order to make the Dudley Municipal Building Project — now named the Bruce C. Bolling Building —
eligible for New Market Tax Credit (“NMTC”) financing. DSRC and FBDC are under the control of the
City. The City’s capital budget and general obligation bond proceeds were the primary project funding
source, but in order to reduce City general obligation funding for the building by approximately $8 million,
all funding flowed through the NMTC financing structure and until the time of retirement of NMTC loans,
ownership of the building is retained by DSRC, with FBDC as sublandlord to the City (for the BPS
occupied space) and to the limited amount of commercially leased space. Lease payments due by the City
for the BPS occupied space flow to DSRC, which utilizes the payments to pay for the project’s NMTC
qualified low-income community investment loans. The annual lease payment is reflected in the City’s
general obligation debt service requirements.
Major Contractual Obligations
In addition to its debt obligations, the City has substantial contractual obligations. Included in this
category are the City’s obligation for pension benefit payments to its contributory retirement system for
City employees and other post employment benefits which are included in the annual tax levy (see
“Employee Benefits”); agreements for the provision of sanitation, solid waste collection and disposal
services (see “The City—Principal Government Services—Public Works”); and agreements with BMCC
for the provision of operating assistance (see “City Indebtedness—Special Obligation Debt” and “Debt of
Agencies Related to the City—Boston Public Health Commission” above). The City has also executed
several equipment lease agreements in order to finance the acquisition of departmental equipment. As of
February 1, 2019, the amount outstanding under the lease agreements equals $54.0 million. Lease payments
are subject to annual appropriation and are not included in the City’s debt statement and other related debt
tables shown above.
The City has also entered into transactions for three development programs under the
Commonwealth’s Infrastructure Investment Incentive (“I-Cubed”) program. See Note 16 to the City’s
audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, which are attached as Exhibit I to this
Appendix A, for information regarding this program and the City’s contingent obligations under it.
Capital Planning and Borrowing Program
Capital Planning Process
The capital planning process coincides with the annual budget cycle and provides an opportunity for
City departments to identify their facility, equipment, infrastructure, technology and planning needs in a
systematic manner and to forward their proposals to the Office of Budget Management (“OBM”) for
funding consideration. The first phase concludes with the release of an updated five-year capital plan
published as part of the City’s annual budget document. The process allows for a continuing reassessment
of capital needs. On April 11, 2018, the Mayor submitted his fiscal 2019 budget to the City Council and
filed $291.3 million in new capital authorizations which were subsequently approved by the City Council.
Capital Funding Plan
The City funds its capital plan primarily through general obligation bonds, other City sources such as
appropriations from the Surplus Property Fund and the Parking Meter Fund, and external grants. This
year’s plan assumes $1.01 billion in new general obligation borrowings over the next five years, including
an estimated $150.0 million in fiscal 2019. The City awards construction contracts and incurs capital outlay
costs based upon appropriations to be funded from bond proceeds and grant receipts. In circumstances
where project expenditures occur prior to the receipt of bond proceeds or grant reimbursements, the City
temporarily pays such costs from available funds.
Current Capital Investment Plans
The fiscal 2019-2023 capital plan makes critical investments in the City’s infrastructure in every
neighborhood, guided by Imagine Boston 2030, the City’s master plan, and the schools, streets, arts,
climate and resilience plans under its umbrella. The City is investing in the core goals of BuildBPS (which
can be found at https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/buildbps), Go Boston 2030 (which can be found at
https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/go-boston-2030), Boston Creates (which can be found
at http://plan.bostoncreates.org/), and Climate Ready Boston (which can be found at
https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/climate-ready-boston). An estimated 85% of the
investment detailed in the fiscal 2019-2023 capital plan is aligned with the City’s long-term planning

A-40

efforts, with the remainder of such investment focused primarily on addressing deferred maintenance for
City-owned assets.
The City is committed to investing $1.0 billion over the next ten years to bring Boston’s school
buildings into the 21st century. In September 2018, the new Dearborn STEM Academy building opened for
students. It is the City’s first school building specifically designed to support STEM-based education.
Construction began in October 2018 on a new $124 million facility for the Boston Arts Academy. The City
continues to make investments in existing school buildings including major renovations, capital
maintenance, and technology.
Major investments are underway in the City’s parks system including a $1.9 million restoration of the
Paul Revere Mall in the North End, pathway improvements around Jamaica Pond totaling $4.8 million, and
a $4.8 million renovation of Noyes Park. The City also expects to spend approximately $96 million over
the next five years renovating or replacing branch libraries.
The City’s investments in its roads and sidewalks reflect the core initiatives outlined in Go Boston
2030 by building roads and sidewalks that are safer for all users, particularly pedestrians and cyclists; travel
that is more reliable, and quality transportation choices that improve access. The capital plan focuses on
roadway corridors, safe crossings, and traffic calming measures on residential streets and in small-business
districts, roadway resurfacing and reconstruction, sidewalk repairs, pedestrian ramp installations and other
work needed to work towards maintaining a state of good repair. Rehabilitation or replacement of bridges
is another area where the City is making substantial infrastructure investments.
The City is making progress in advancing its Climate Ready Boston plan, a strategic roadmap to
reduce the City’s risk to short-term and long-term climate change impacts including sea level rise,
increased precipitation, and extreme temperatures. The plan was released in December 2016 and features
four components: updated climate projections, vulnerability assessments, focus areas, and climate
resilience initiatives. The challenges from climate change are substantial and complex but can be addressed
through actions that support the City’s vitality and livability. Leveraging outside funding, the Capital Plan
supports the development of more detailed climate plans for Boston neighborhoods, especially those most
at risk for coastal flooding, such as Charlestown, East Boston, and certain other neighborhoods. These
plans are essential for protecting the safety of existing residents, businesses, and institutions, and for
ensuring the implementation of continued growth and development. Early action items have emerged from
these studies including a removable floodwall to protect the East Boston Greenway and the planned
elevation of Main Street by two feet in Charlestown which is expected to block the main flood pathway
across the community.
The City has followed this work with similar, ongoing efforts in South Boston and Moakley Park, in
partnership with the Boston Planning and Development Agency. The Boston Planning and Development
Agency also asks all large, new developments to plan for at least 40 inches of sea level rise as part of the
Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience Checklist under the Article 80 review process. This level of
protection is consistent with Climate Ready Boston sea level rise projections through the end of the century.
The City plans to update these projections and standards regularly to make its building stock more resilient
and reduce risk.
In fiscal year 2019, the City released resilient infrastructure design standards through its Public
Works Department that provide consistent guidelines for enhancing the resilience of construction and
capital improvement projects, especially those in the public right-of-way. The City will extend
neighborhood-scale climate resilience planning to an additional neighborhood identified as a “critical
resilience focus area.”
In addition to the initiatives described above, the Boston Housing Authority (the “BHA”) is planning
to undertake a major rehabilitation of its largest housing project in Charlestown. The current proposal
would redevelop over 1,100 units of public housing with an estimated cost of approximately $1.2 billion.
The project would be a multi-year effort and would utilize state and federal funds, private funding and, if
authorized, some City funding. However, the City has made no decision yet on the amount or timing of
any support for this project.
In view of the economic and social benefits of consistent, long-range capital planning, the City
remains committed to implementing its capital program, subject to available resources, including
maximizing funding from state and federal sources and where appropriate, private funding sources, and an
on-going assessment of the City’s needs and priorities.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Retirement Systems
Employees of the City of Boston are not participants in the federal social security system; instead, the
City participates in a contributory defined benefit retirement system that is administered by the Boston
Retirement System (“BRS” or “System”). The BRS is a cost sharing multiple-employer qualified defined
benefit governmental pension plan as defined by federal law and is governed by the provisions of
Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32. The BRS is administered by a five member board: the City
Auditor, who serves ex-officio; two individuals elected by members of the System; an individual chosen by
the Mayor; and an individual chosen by the other four members or appointed by the Mayor if the other four
members do not agree on a selection within 30 days of a vacancy. Retirement payments are issued on a
monthly basis and payments are funded through a combination of mandatory deductions from current
employees, employer contributions, Commonwealth appropriations and investment earnings.
In addition to appropriation payments to cover current and future benefit payments of City employees
covered by the BRS, the City funds the benefit provisions of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 32 as
applied to non-contributory retirees and beneficiaries whose employment predates the BRS; Section 100
death benefit recipients; and the provisions of applicable Massachusetts Special Acts. These retirees and
beneficiaries receive benefits for their lifetime.
The City implemented GASB Statement No. 73, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions
and Related Assets That Are Not Within the Scope of GASB No. 68, which extends the financial reporting
requirements to pension benefits provided outside a trust or equivalent agreement. The Accounting
Valuation Report for the City’s Non-contributory and Special Legislation Retirees as of June 30, 2018
reports that the City is providing such benefits to 71 pensioners as of July 1, 2016. These benefits are
funded on a pay-as-you-go basis with annual benefits of approximately $4.0 million. Since the benefits of
these pensioners and beneficiaries are not pre-funded, the Plan’s fiduciary net position is $0, and therefore
the net pension liability is equal to the total pension liability. The City’s net pension liability for the
noncontributory retirees and beneficiaries is $85.9 million, as of June 30, 2018. As of January 1, 2019, the
City is providing such benefits to 57 pensioners; these benefits are funded on a pay as you go basis with
monthly pension payments of approximately $318,400.
On December 4, 2008, the City, the BRS, the Public Employee Retirement Administration
Commission (“PERAC”), and the Commonwealth entered into a memorandum of agreement to transfer the
direct responsibility for funding the liability of Boston teachers’ pensions to the Commonwealth effective
fiscal 2010; legislation mirroring this agreement was signed into law on May 22, 2010. Among the
significant transactions which took place shortly after passage of the legislation were: a) the BRS
transferred 27% of the market value of its assets to the Pension Reserve Investment Trust (“PRIT”) Fund as
the portion of the BRS assets related to Boston teacher pension liability according to a valuation accepted
by all parties in the aforementioned memorandum of agreement, and b) the last reimbursement originally
scheduled to go to the City's General Fund, $126.9 million, was directly deposited with the BRS to reduce
the BRS—Excluding Teachers unfunded liability. The BRS continues to administer pension services for all
Boston teacher employees, retirees and beneficiaries. The legislation eliminated the three-party
(BRS/Commonwealth/City of Boston) transaction, based partly on outdated pay-as-you-go methodology,
and replaced it with a more financially sound two party (BRS/Commonwealth) transaction that clarifies
ownership of the liability and is based upon current year, actuarially calculated funding.
Chapter 61 of the Acts of 2009, as amended, transferred approximately 1,000 employees of the
Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department to the Commonwealth effective January 1, 2010. All current and
future Suffolk County Sheriff employees became members of the State Retirement System and are now the
fiscal responsibility of the Commonwealth. Former employees of the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department,
who retired prior to January 1, 2010, remain members of the BRS and their respective pension liability
remains the obligation of the City.
The following table reflects amounts expended or budgeted by the City for pension payments for
fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2019. These numbers include contributions for both contributory and noncontributory members. The contributory numbers are primarily driven by amortization of the BRS
unfunded liability, which is on a schedule that targets reducing this liability to zero by fiscal 2025, 15 years
earlier than the statutory deadline at the end of fiscal 2040.

The City’s 2019 budgeted contribution of $242.0 million includes $230.3 million allocable to City
employees, other than teachers, $11.4 million allocable to the Boston Water and Sewer Commission
(BWSC) of which approximately $5.3 million will be reimbursed to the City for employee service accrued
after BWSC became an independent commission, and $0.4 million allocable to the Boston Public Health
Commission (BPHC). BPHC’s contribution towards their pension obligation in fiscal 2019 totals $20
million. BPHC’s fiscal 2019 pension obligation is paid in large part from BPHC’s fiscal 2019 general fund
appropriation in the amount of $15.8 million while the remainder is funded by grant resources.
The actuarial accrued liability of the BRS exceeds the actuarial value of the assets of the BRS as of
the most recent valuation dated January 1, 2018. The following table summarizes the results of the last four

Boston Retirement System.

The most recent actuarial valuation is as of January 1, 2018 (the “2018 Valuation”) and is available at
https://www.boston.gov/departments/retirement. The January 1, 2018 valuation assumes a long-term rate of
return of 7.5% for BRS—Excluding Teachers assets. The long-term rate of return assumption was lowered
from 7.75% to 7.5% beginning with the 2018 Valuation. The actuarial valuation of assets is determined
annually by recognizing 20% of gains or losses, and to the extent necessary, by also recognizing any
additional portion of gains or losses, which keeps the actuarial valuation of assets between 80% and 120%
of market value. The net effect is a smoother trend of annual pension funding during volatile short-term
periods of asset gains or losses. The following table shows the market and actuarial value of the plan’s nonteacher assets.

Boston Retirement System.

As of December 31, 2018, the estimated market value of assets not held for teacher benefit payments
was approximately $4.58 billion. This amount is an estimate based upon then current market values of
certain assets held by the BRS and prior period values for certain other assets for which the current market
value is not readily ascertainable. This amount is unaudited and subject to change. It should be noted that
the annual required contribution of the City is based, in part, upon the actuarial value of assets, not market
A-43

values. This is commonly done in computing annual funding requirements in order to prevent extreme
fluctuations that might otherwise arise from temporary or cyclical economic and market conditions.
In accordance with Chapter 68 of the Acts of 2007, the state regulatory agency for pensions, PERAC,
annually reviews the investment performance and funded ratio of systems as of January 1st. If a system is:
(i) less than 65% funded, and (ii) has trailed the investment performance of the PRIT fund by 2% or more
on an average annualized basis over the previous ten year period, PERAC will declare the system
underperforming and the system shall transfer its assets to the PRIT fund. For reasons unrelated to Chapter
68, the BRS–Teachers assets are invested in the PRIT fund; the BRS–Excluding Teachers is currently
funded at 76.92% based on the actuarial value of assets.
For additional information concerning a comparison of the market value of assets and investment
return to the actuarial value of assets and investment return for the period 2006 through 2017, see Exhibit G
in Section 4 of the 2018 Valuation referenced above. The City is currently committed to a funding schedule
for fiscal 2019 and 2020 that is based on the most recent actuarial valuation, incorporating asset and
liability data as of January 1, 2018. The funding schedule is calculated in accordance with the entry age
actuarial cost method and includes paying the current year’s present value of benefits earned during the
year (“normal cost”) and an annual contribution toward eliminating the unfunded liability of the BRS by
2025, 15 years ahead of the statutory deadline at the end of fiscal 2040.
Many variables are in play with each new valuation, and the actuary’s recommendations and
consultation with the City are part of a careful planning process that precedes the BRS final approval of the
valuation and funding schedule. In the 2018 Valuation, salary increase assumptions for all employee
groups for the BRS, excluding teachers, did not change, and the mortality tables were adjusted to better
reflect longer life expectancies. Beginning in 2018, the BRS lowered the investment long-term rate of
return assumption from 7.75% to 7.5%. In the 2018 Valuation, assumptions were adjusted to reflect an
increase to the retiree Cost of Living Adjustment (“COLA”) base from $13,000 to $14,000 as of July 1,
2017. The changes in assumptions increased the unfunded liability by $200.4 million and increased the
normal cost by $8.4 million for the BRS excluding teachers.
The City currently expects to fully amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability by June 30,
2025. Page 30 of the 2018 Valuation sets forth the aggregate funding schedule from 2019 through 2025
for the BRS, excluding teachers. The City’s contributions for the amortization of the unfunded liability are
estimated to increase from the $242.0 million budgeted amount in fiscal 2019 to $382.2 million in fiscal
2024 and then would decrease to $215.8 million in fiscal 2025. The City’s total employer contributions
each year will also include the normal costs for each year and will also reflect certain annual savings from
prior year additional payments. This schedule is illustrative only. The actual annual contributions will
differ due to the actual circumstances that will occur in the future and that will likely vary from the
assumptions used in the 2018 Valuation. For example, the actual rate of return on assets for the year ended
December 31, 2017, approximately 17.9%, was above the assumed rate of return (and is reflected in the
2018 Valuation), but the actual rate of return for the year ended December 31, 2018, currently estimated at
-5.6%, is below the 7.5% assumed rate of return currently in effect. The negative return as of December
31, 2018 would require significantly higher annual contributions than shown in the current funding
schedule even if actual future results match actuarial assumptions, although as noted above, actual future
contributions will be based on future valuations and will likely vary from the current schedule in any
event. The City believes that its current pension funding schedule, with its conservative salary growth
assumptions, is sufficient to absorb the long term impacts of collective bargaining awards. The funding
schedule assumes a 4.0% salary growth assumption for general service employees, a 4.25% salary growth
assumption for certain employees with hazardous occupations, and a 4.50% salary growth assumption for
public safety officers. The City’s pension liability is reevaluated every two years and adjustments are
made to the funding schedule, as needed.
In June 2012, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) issued GASB Statement No.
68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, which sets forth new standards that modifies the
accounting and financial reporting of the City’s pension obligations. The new standard for governments
that provide employee pension benefits requires the City to report in its statement of net position a net
pension liability (“NPL”), defined as the difference between the total pension liability (the present value of
projected benefit payments to employees based on their past service) and the fiduciary net position of the
Plan determined based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles set aside in a trust and restricted
to paying benefits to current employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. The rate used to discount projected
benefit payments to their present value is based on a single rate that reflects (a) the long-term expected rate
of return on plan investments as long as the plan net position is projected under specified conditions to be
sufficient to pay pensions of current employees and retirees and the pension plan assets are expected to be

A-44

invested using a strategy to achieve that return and (b) a yield or index rate based on tax-exempt 20-year
AA or higher rated municipal bonds to the extent that the conditions for use of the long-term expected rate
of return are not met. The date after which a yield or index rate on tax-exempt 20-year AA-or-higher rated
municipal bonds is required to be used is referred to as a “crossover date.”
GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions standard was effective
commencing with the City’s fiscal 2015. The Total Pension Liability (“TPL”) and plan’s fiduciary net
position as of December 31, 2017 for the BRS, including teachers were approximately $10.79 billion and
$6.77 billion, respectively, which results in a Net Pension Liability (“NPL”) of approximately $4.02 billion
as of December 31, 2017, as compared to an NPL of $4.16 billion as of December 31, 2016. The portion of
the BRS NPL allocable to the City reported at June 30, 2018 is approximately $1.29 billion, which amount
includes the NPL associated with City employees, excluding teachers. The BRS did not experience a
“crossover date” in connection with determination of the NPL and accordingly, the measurement of the
City’s NPL for fiscal 2018 assumes a 7.5% discount rate which is the same as the expected rate of return of
Plan investments for the BRS, excluding teachers. The annual money-weighted rate of return, net of
investment expense for the BRS for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 17.7%. The comparable rate of
return for the year ended December 31, 2018 is currently estimated at -5.6%.
Implementation of GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions also
requires setting forth the sensitivity of the City’s net pension liability using an assumed discount rate that is
one percentage point lower and one percentage point higher than the current rate. A 1% decrease would
increase the City’s net pension liability to approximately $1.90 billion and a 1% increase would lower it to
approximately $767.2 million.
While GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions changes the way
state and local governments report pension benefits in their financial statements it does not impact pension
funding requirements or contribution amounts. To date, the City has contributed to the BRS 100% of the
amounts required to be so contributed, as determined in accordance with actuarial valuations and a funding
schedule established pursuant to state law, which are approved by PERAC, and the City expects to continue
to do so. As noted above, the City currently intends to fully fund its unfunded actuarial accrued liability by
June 30, 2025.
In connection with the implementation of GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial
Reporting for Pensions, the BRS prepared a document called “Schedules of Employer Allocations and
Pension Amounts by Employers,” which was audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent auditors for the
BRS. These schedules are based on financial information pertaining to the BRS as of December 31, 2017.
The schedules are available at https://www.boston.gov/departments/retirement, along with the most
recent actuarial valuation reports and audited financial statements of the BRS. See also Note 11 to the
City’s fiscal 2018 audited financial statements attached hereto as Exhibit I.
Other Post Employment Benefits
In addition to the pension benefits described above, the City provides post-employment health care
and life insurance benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis to approximately 15,000 City (including teachers) and
Boston Public Health Commission participating retirees and their beneficiaries.
In June 2015, the GASB issued Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for
Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions. The objective of this Statement is to improve accounting
and financial reporting by state and local governments for postemployment benefits other than pensions
(OPEB). It also improves information provided by state and local governmental employers about financial
support for OPEB that is provided by other entities to the extent applicable. This Statement is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2017. In February 2016, the City began to take steps to review this
standard and worked with Segal Consulting (City’s OPEB actuary) to develop a plan to provide the
necessary information in a timely manner to the City and to discuss what changes were expected for the
June 30, 2017 valuation. The City also began to evaluate the effect on its financial statements and began
educating significant stakeholders within the organization on these changes. Thus, the City was positioned
to meet the required reporting for fiscal 2018. The new GASB 75 standard was effective commencing with
fiscal 2018 for both the City and BPHC.
The Total OPEB Liability (“TOL”) and plan’s fiduciary net position as of June 30, 2017 (the
measurement date) for the City were approximately $2.7 billion and $453.0 million, respectively, which
results in a Net OPEB Liability (“NOL”) for the City of approximately $2.29 billion as of June 30, 2018, as
compared to an NOL of $2.25 billion as of June 30, 2017. The measurement of the City’s NOL for fiscal
2018 assumes a 6.75% discount rate. The annual money-weighted rate of return, net of investment expense
for the City for the year ended June 30, 2018 was 5.6%.
A-45

The Total OPEB Liability (“TOL”) and plan’s fiduciary net position as of June 30, 2017 (the
measurement date) for BPHC were approximately $129.4 million and $17.3 million, respectively, which
results in a Net OPEB Liability (“NOL”) for BPHC of approximately $112.1 million as of June 30, 2018,
as compared to an NOL of $119.3 million as of June 30, 2017. The measurement of the BPHC’s NOL for
fiscal 2018 assumes a 4.65% discount rate. Similarly, the annual money-weighted rate of return, net of
investment expense for BPHC for the year ended June 30, 2018 was 5.6%.
Implementation of GASB 75 requires setting forth the sensitivity of the net OPEB liability using an
assumed discount rate that is one percentage point lower and one percentage point higher than the current
rate. A 1% decrease would increase the City’s net OPEB liability to approximately $2.68 billion and a 1%
increase would lower it to approximately $1.9 billion. A 1% decrease would increase the BPHC’s net
OPEB liability to approximately $135.4 million and a 1% increase would decrease it to approximately
$93.5 million.
In addition, implementation of GASB 75 also requires setting forth the sensitivity of the net OPEB
liability using an assumed health care cost trend rate that is one percentage point lower and one percentage
point higher than the current rate. A 1% decrease would decrease the City’s net OPEB liability to
approximately $1.9 billion and a 1% increase would increase it to approximately $2.7 billion. A 1%
decrease would decrease the BPHC’s net OPEB liability to approximately $90.2 million and a 1% increase
would increase it to approximately $140.8 million.
As a result of the implementation of GASB 75, the net position of the governmental activities as of
July 1, 2017 was restated by $(1.4) billion, which resulted in a net deficit position as of June 30, 2017 of
$(1.9) billion, as compared to a previously determined net deficit position as of June 30, 2017 of $(504.9)
million. The net position of the BPHC as of July 1, 2017 was restated by $(20.8) million, which resulted in
a net deficit position as of June 30, 2017 of $(190.8) million, as compared to a previously determined net
deficit position as of June 30, 2017 of $(170.0) million.
While GASB 75 changes the way state and local governments report other post-employment benefits
in their financial statements it does not impact OPEB funding requirements or contribution amounts. In
fiscal 2008, the City began voluntary annual appropriations to reduce its OPEB liability. Aggregate City
appropriations since that time through fiscal 2018 total $375.0 million. The City appropriated an additional
$40.0 million in fiscal 2019. Annual appropriations are retained in an irrevocable trust fund, which is
authorized through the City’s acceptance of M.G.L. Chapter 32B Section 20, and is established under a
trust agreement between the City and the City’s Collector-Treasurer as trustee and custodian. A separate
OPEB trust fund has also been established by the BPHC and $13.75 million has been deposited through
fiscal 2018. The BPHC deposited an additional $2.25 million in fiscal 2019. The City has procured
investment consulting services in order to optimize investment of the OPEB Trust Funds. The aggregate
amount on deposit in the OPEB Trust Funds as of December 31, 2018 was $557.1 million.
The increase in the UAAL was due to the net effect of a number of factors. The UAAL had been
expected to increase by approximately $128 million due to normal plan operations. An actuarial loss
increased obligations by approximately $18 million while valuation assumption changes decreased
obligations by approximately $44 million, including a decrease in the discount rate from 7% to 6.75% for
the City. The BPHC discount rate was increased from 5.5% to 6.75%.
If the City and the BPHC were to fund the actuarially determined contribution rather than the pay-asyou go amounts described in the next paragraph, the required funding for fiscal 2018 would have been
$199.6 million, of which $71.9 million represents the normal cost and $127.7 million represents
amortization of the unfunded actuarial determined liability.
The June 30, 2017 valuation projects that the City and the BPHC (the funding for which is
appropriated by the City to the BPHC as part of its overall departmental budget) will pay benefits (net of
retiree contributions) on behalf of current retired employees of approximately $121.8 million in fiscal 2018,
on a pay-as-you-go basis (as compared to $121.5 million in fiscal 2017). Along with the previously
mentioned additional appropriation to the trust funds mentioned above from both the City and the BPHC
totaling $42.25 million in fiscal 2018, the City and the BPHC were projected to fund 82% of the actuarially
determined contribution in fiscal 2018.
The June 30, 2017 actuarial valuation projects pay-as-you-go benefit payments to increase to
approximately $411.7 million in fiscal 2042, as compared to an actuarially determined contribution of
$294.2 million in fiscal 2042. If the City continues to make an annual additional appropriation of $40.0
million through fiscal 2025 and $100.0 million annually thereafter, the obligations are predicted to be fully
funded in fiscal 2043. When the obligations are fully funded, the City expects to continue to fund the
normal cost into the trust fund and pay the projected benefits (net retiree contributions) on behalf of current

A-46

retired employees from the trust fund.
The funding schedule for BPHC reflects their policy to contribute an additional annual amount of
$2.25 million. This projected contribution will not fully fund the obligation over a 30-year period. This is
illustrative only of the currently expected funding schedule. The actual funding schedule will be different
due to the actual circumstances that will occur and that will likely vary from the assumptions used in the
June 30, 2017 valuation.

December 24, 2018
The Honorable Mayor,
Members of the City Council,
and Citizens of Boston:
We are pleased to submit to you the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) of the City of
Boston (City) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The CAFR is prepared by the City’s Auditing Department,
and is intended to provide information regarding the financial position of the City. This report is prepared
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as established by the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), and meets all requirements of state finance law of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as well as the City Charter.
The responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and fairness of the data presented, including
disclosures, rests with the City. City management believes this report is accurate in all material respects
and is presented in a manner which fairly sets forth the financial position and results of operations of the
City. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal accounting controls designed
to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that these financial statements are complete and
accurate in their presentation.
The Auditing Department uses an integrated financial and human resources management system
referred to as the Boston Administrative Information System (BAIS). The system is designed to track and
control daily activities and report the financial position of the City. This cutting edge software allows
management to directly evaluate the financial status of individual programs as well as the entire department,
and also supports the rigorous monitoring and reporting requirements enforced by the City.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, through Chapter 190 of the Acts of 1982, requires that the City
undergo an annual audit performed by a firm of independent public accountants. The City has selected
KPMG LLP to perform the June 30, 2018 audit. This audit is conducted in accordance with generally accepted
government auditing standards (GAGAS) issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. The audit
provides an independent review to help assure a fair presentation of the City’s financial position and results
of operations.
The City also undergoes an annual audit of its federal grant funds as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of
Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit
Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). KPMG LLP issues separate reports on the City’s
internal control systems and compliance with applicable laws and regulations that meet the requirements

ii • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

of the Uniform Guidance. A substantial focus of the Single Audit is to evaluate the City’s internal control
structure. The evaluation includes testing a significant number of the major federal program transactions
that occurred during the fiscal year. The Single Audit also requires that the auditors determine whether the
organization has complied with laws and regulations that may have a material effect on each of its major
federal financial assistance programs. All of the City’s major federal programs are evaluated for the adequacy
of internal controls and compliance with laws and regulations. The report is publicly issued under a separate
cover.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) follows the independent auditors’ report and provides
a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to accompany the basic financial statements. This letter of
transmittal is intended to complement the MD&A and should be read in conjunction with it.

-Mayor Martin J. Walsh

Profile of the Government
The City of Boston, incorporated as a town in 1630 and as a City in 1822, is located on the Shawmut
Peninsula, at the confluence of the Charles and Mystic Rivers. The City lies adjacent to Boston Harbor, which
is a part of Massachusetts Bay and leads ultimately to the North Atlantic Ocean. The Charles River separates
Boston from Cambridge and Watertown, while the Mystic River determines the boundaries between
Chelsea and Everett. The Neponset River separates the southern neighborhoods of Boston from the Town
of Milton and City of Quincy.
The City of Boston exists under Chapter 486 of the Acts of 1909 and Chapter 452 of the Acts of 1948
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which, as amended, constitute the City’s Charter. The Mayor is

Introductory Section • iii

elected to a four-year term and serves as chief executive officer of the City. The Mayor has general
supervision of and control over the City’s boards, commissions, officers and departments. The legislative
body of the City is the City Council, which consists of 13 elected members serving two-year terms.
Mayor Martin J. Walsh, the City's 54th Mayor was re-elected to a second-term that began in January
2018 and runs through January 2022. Prior to his service as Mayor, Mayor Walsh was a member of the
Massachusetts House of Representatives, serving as the State Representative from the Thirteenth Suffolk
District from 1997 through 2013. Mayor Walsh continues to work tirelessly towards making Boston a city
where everyone has the opportunity to succeed. His vision, shaped by thousands of Boston voices, envisions
a city that will expand opportunity for all, support a dynamic economy, enhance quality of life, and prepare
for climate changes. Through Imagine Boston 2030, the Mayor has identified key areas where Boston can
take action to enhance neighborhoods’ vitality: encourage mixed-use job centers; provide spaces for new
housing and jobs; create a waterfront for future generations; and connect historically underserved
neighborhoods to more opportunities. The $2.4 billion fiscal year 2019-2023 Capital Plan is discussed in
more detail in the Long-Term Financial Planning section.
The City budgets and maintains its books and records on a statutory basis of accounting prescribed by
the Massachusetts Division of Local Services, Bureau of Accounts. This basis of accounting differs from
GAAP. The accounts of the City are organized on a fund basis. Each fund is considered to be a separate
accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted for by providing a separate set of self-balancing
accounts, which comprise each fund’s assets, liabilities, fund balance, revenues, and expenses.
The General Fund is the only fund for which a budget is legally adopted. The budgets for all departments
included in the General Fund of the City, except the School Department, are prepared under the direction
of the Mayor and City Council. Departmental budgets are established at the account level and so voted by
the City Council. The School Department budget is prepared under the direction of the School Committee.
Original and supplemental appropriations are submitted by the Mayor, approved by the City Council, and
lapse at year end unless encumbered. The legal level of control over appropriations is at the department
level. Amendments to the original budget must be approved by the City Council, except for a reallocation
of appropriations of up to $3.0 million, which the Mayor may approve. Further, the City Auditor, with the
approval of the Mayor, may make transfers from any appropriation to any other appropriation for purposes
of eliminating deficits before closing the books for the fiscal year.
Included in the basic financial statements, which are prepared on the GAAP basis of accounting, are
governmental activities, each major fund, the aggregate discretely presented component units, and
aggregate remaining fund information. Discretely presented component units are reported in a separate
column to emphasize their operational and/or financial relationship with the City. The Boston Retirement
System (BRS) has been presented as a blended component unit because it provides services almost
exclusively to the primary government. The Dudley Square Realty Corporation (DSRC) and the Ferdinand
Building Development Corporation (FBDC) are also presented as blended component units for the same
reason. The Notes to the Financial Statements further discuss the City’s financial reporting entity.

iv • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Local Economy
Boston is the twenty-second largest City, in terms of population, in the United States and is the
economic hub of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Commonwealth”). It is a center for
professional services, business, finance, technology, research and development, higher education and
health care, as well as for transportation, exports, communications, culture and entertainment. Under the
leadership of Mayor Walsh, the City is vigorously pursing economic opportunities to ensure Boston will
continue to be a global leader in the twenty -first century.
The City is the capital of the Commonwealth and is host to several other governmental agencies. Using
the employment data from Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor
and Workforce Development (EOLWD), BPDA Research estimated that the government employment in the
City of Boston is 75,807 in 2017. Large state government offices, federal regional offices, U.S. Postal Service
facilities, state-chartered authorities and commissions such as the Massachusetts Port Authority and the
Boston Water and Sewer Commission, and the City’s local government agencies and departments are all
located within the City.
Healthcare, higher education and financial services play major roles in Boston's economy. The health
care and social assistance industry employs the largest number of people in Boston, 18% of total jobs.
Twenty-five community-based health centers and twenty-one inpatient hospitals are located within the
City, including Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, Tufts New England Medical Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
and Boston Medical Center. Thirty-five colleges and universities reside in Boston, accounting for just under
150,000 full and part-time students. Included among the City's colleges and universities are some of the
finest institutions in the country. The City is the home of the medical, dental and public health schools of
Harvard, Boston College, Tufts, Northeastern and Boston University. Many of the country's leading financial
services firms are located in Boston, including Fidelity Investments, John Hancock/ManuLife Financial, State
Street Corporation, and Wellington Management. In 2017, there were over 120,000 people employed in
the finance, insurance and real estate industries in Boston.
Boston's economy, on average, outperformed both Massachusetts and the nation in terms of job
growth from 2006 through 2016. During that period Boston's annual job growth was 1.7%. Financial markets
have continued to express confidence in Boston’s fiscal health during the past year. In May 2018, the rating
service bureaus Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s reaffirmed the City’s bond ratings at
Aaa and AAA, respectively, reflecting the City’s capacity to pay debt service. The credit reports from both
agencies highlighted Boston’s strong management throughout economic cycles as well as having historically
strong reserves while exhibiting positive financial performance.
Boston’s economic growth continues, with low unemployment, the arrival of high profile firms, and a
real estate market still in the midst of an historic building boom. The continued economic growth has
enabled the City to invest in key initiatives in the areas of affordable housing, public safety and the future
of transportation.

Introductory Section • v

Financial Overview
The City is required to have a balanced budget in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.),
Chapter 59, Section 23. As part of the State Department of Revenue’s tax rate certification process, the City
must balance all appropriations, fixed costs, and prior year deficits with the approved property tax levy,
estimated local revenues, and available prior year surpluses in order to obtain authorization to issue
property tax bills. Over two-thirds of the City’s revenues come from the property tax levy; however, the
increase in the levy from year to year is limited by state law. In fiscal year 2018, the net property tax levy
(levy less a reserve for abatements) totaled $2.19 billion.
State aid from the Commonwealth comprises the second largest single revenue source to the City’s
General Fund budget after the Property Tax. Since 2016 gross state aid has continued to increase. However,
net sate aid continues to decrease. In fiscal year 2018, net state aid, decreased by $8.9 million. In fiscal year
2019, net state aid is expected to decrease to $159.1 million. Please see the Management’s Discussion and
Analysis Section for additional information on financial trends.
In fiscal year 2018, in order to partially fund the annual required contribution associated with the other
postemployment benefits (OPEB) liability, the City appropriated $40.0 million from the General Fund into
the OPEB Liability Trust Fund. The City’s OPEB financing plan balances the duty to deliver valuable public
services while acknowledging the cost of providing health benefits for our employees, both now and when
they retire. More details and information on the OPEB liability can be found in note 12 to the Financial
Statements.
In November 2016, Boston voters approved the adoption of the Massachusetts Community
Preservation Act (CPA). By adopting the CPA, the City has created a Community Preservation Fund. The
City finances this fund in part by a 1% property tax-based surcharge on residential and business property
tax bills, which began in July 2017. The City will use this revenue to fund the following types of initiatives
consistent with the CPA guidelines: the creation and acquisition of affordable housing, historic preservation,
open space and public recreation.
Health, dental and life insurance costs and Medicare taxes continue to increase over the years. Health
benefits for over 29,000 City employees and retirees are managed by the Health Benefits Program. Over
95% of the City’s share of health benefits costs are self-insured through Internal Service Fund. Actuarially
determined reserves are maintained in the Fund to stabilize rate increases and protect against large claims
or cost increases.
Most of the City’s workforce is represented by one of 41 different unions. Collectively, these unions
represent approximately 19,000 employees. As of October 2018, 31 of these unions (or 76%) reached multiyear contracts beginning in 2016. The agreement with the Boston Teacher’s Union, which has over 8,000
members, was for two years and expired in August 2018. Unions with currently settled contracts, including
all four sworn police unions, AFSCME, SEIU and SENA, represent in total over 7,000 bargaining unit members.
Those seven contracts are four years in duration and include wage increases of 2% each year and other
benefits. The City continues to negotiate with the unions without settled agreements.
In fiscal year 2018, the GAAP General Fund equity increased to $1.1 billion, thus allowing the City to
preserve its policy of maintaining a GAAP unassigned fund balance in the General Fund that is 15% or higher

vi • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

than the current fiscal year’s GAAP General Fund operating expenditures. The GAAP unassigned fund
balance at the end of fiscal year 2018 was $781.40 million and $300.65 million was assigned. The unassigned
fund balance represents approximately 23.9% of GAAP General Fund operating expenditures.
Mayor Walsh's fiscal year 2019 budget affirms a commitment to progress, opportunity and innovation
by investing in Boston Neighborhoods while maintaining the Mayor's strong record of fiscal management.
The $3.29 billion plan is balanced, sustainable, and accelerates progress across public policy areas. The
budget contains historic levels of funding for public education, new investments for public safety, continued
efforts to create affordable and middle income housing, expanded services for residents struggling with
substance disorders and addiction, and new initiatives that will transform the future of transportation in
Boston.
Long Term Financial Planning
Imagine Boston 2030, the City's first comprehensive planning process in fifty years, is underway.
Boston’s five-year $2.4 billion Capital Plan, is an investment program for the City’s future. An ambitious set
of initiatives form the foundation of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan. Taken together, these initiatives will
support Boston’s dynamic economy and improve quality of life for residents by encouraging affordability,
increasing access to opportunity, promoting a healthy environment, and guiding investment in the public
realm. Last year, Mayor Walsh launched the Imagine Boston Capital Plan to move Boston Residents' priorities
from idea to action, and invest in creating the City Bostonians imagine for the future. This year, under
Imagine Boston 2030 umbrella, the City is investing deeply in the core goals of BuildBPS, Go Boston 2030,
Boston Creates, and Climate Ready Boston. The City's capital plan is an important tool in realizing the goals
and vision of Boston 2030. All projects in the Capital Plan are categorized as Upkeep, New/Major Renovation,
Upgrade, and Planning or Matching Funds. The Capital Budgeting Program of the Office of Budget
Management (OBM) tracks the overall distribution of these categories to maintain a balance between the
upkeep of existing assets and the expansion or introduction of new ones. The distribution of allocations for
fiscal year 2019 are 34.0% for New/Major Renovations, 38.0% for Upgrades, 22.0% for Upkeep, 1.0% for
Planning or Matching fund requirements and 5% for the City's contributions to MassDOT and MBTA
construction projects.
Financing for the fiscal year 2019-2023 Capital Plan comes from General Obligation (G.O.) bonds, state
and federal funds, trust funds, and other funds. G.O. bonds represent 61.1% of all project funding. The
capital plan assumes $1.01 billion in new G.O. borrowings over the next five years to support ongoing capital
needs, a 6.8% increase over last year's plan. Effective debt management ensures that the City can meet its
capital infrastructure and facility needs. The Treasury Department manages all borrowings according to the
City’s debt management policies. These policies address issues such as debt affordability and limitations
on the level of variable rate debt the City will use. The City’s goal is to rapidly repay debt, maintain a
conservative level of outstanding debt, and ensure the City’s continued positive financial standing with the
bond market. More details and information on the Long-Term Obligations can be found in note 10 to the
Financial Statements.
State and federal funds in the five-year Capital Plan are currently estimated at $353.2 million and
$349.8 million, respectively. One federal program is the Connect Historic Boston Project. Two of the state
financing programs include the School Building Assistance (SBA) program and the Massachusetts

Introductory Section • vii

Department of Transportation's Highway Division’s Chapter 90 funds. The SBA, which is administered by
the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA), provides an important revenue source for school
renovation and construction. Annually, the MSBA accepts new project requests from cities, towns, and
school districts, and if a project is ultimately approved, the MSBA will pay 40% to 80% of eligible project
costs. The MSBA funded a grant totaling $37.4 million for the new Dearborn Stem Academy which opened
in September 2018. In addition, the City has three projects underway through the MSBA Accelerated Repair
Program for window and door replacement projects at seven schools with a maximum grant of $16.4 million;
a grant for up to $6.4 million for roof and boiler projects at five schools; and the MSBA approved a maximum
project grant totaling $48.9 million for a project at the Boston Arts Academy. For fiscal year 2019 to 2023,
the total payments are estimated at $7.6 million. Chapter 90 allocates funds by formula through state bond
authorizations and through the state budget to all cities and towns in the Commonwealth. The City uses
Chapter 90 funds to support its roadway resurfacing and reconstruction programs. Based on recent
allocations, the City expects an estimated $14.4 million in Chapter 90 funds to be provided in fiscal year
2019.
The City continues to aggressively pursue grant funds, maximize the use of Chapter 90 funds, and
actively manage its projects to ensure that spending does not exceed projections and that priority projects
move forward. Together, these strategies will enable the City to maintain a reasonable level of capital
spending and borrowing and prudently manage its outstanding debt.
Awards
The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) awarded a
Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to the City of Boston for its CAFR for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, a governmental unit
must publish an easily readable and efficiently organized CAFR. This report must satisfy both GAAP and
applicable state and local legal requirements. A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of only one
year. We believe that our current report meets the Certificate of Achievement program requirements, and
we are submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for a certificate.
In addition, the City also received the GFOA’s Award for Distinguished Budget Presentation for its
Annual Budget document for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017. The City’s budget document was judged
to be proficient in several categories including policy documentation and financial planning.
Acknowledgements
We would like to express our appreciation to the staff of the Accounting Program and all the members
of the Auditing Department whose professionalism and dedication made the timely preparation of the
CAFR possible. We also wish to thank the professional staff of KPMG LLP for their counsel, technical
assistance, and continued support in the preparation of this CAFR. Several other City departments and
agencies provided additional information and assisted in the CAFR preparation. We gratefully acknowledge
their efforts and contributions to this report. Finally, we wish to thank you for your continued interest in
the financial operations of the City.

Independent Auditors' Report • 1

KPMG LLP
Two Financial Center
60 South Street
Boston, MA 02111

Independent Auditors’ Report
To the Honorable Mayor and City Council
City of Boston, Massachusetts:

Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the aggregate
discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of
the City of Boston, Massachusetts (the City), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related
notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements as listed
in the table of contents.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation,
and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We did not audit
the financial statements of the Dudley Square Realty Corporation, the Ferdinand Building Development
Corporation, and the City’s Permanent Funds, which represent 4.9% and 0.3% of the assets and revenues
of the governmental activities, respectively, and 1.3% and 0.6% of the assets and revenues of the
aggregate remaining fund information, respectively. We also did not audit the financial statements of the
Boston Retirement System and the City’s OPEB Trust Fund and Private-Purpose Trust Funds, which
represent 97.2% and 87.4% of the assets and revenues of the aggregate remaining fund information,
respectively. Further, we did not audit the financial statements of the Boston Public Health Commission,
Trustees of the Public Library of the City of Boston and the Economic Development and Industrial
Corporation of Boston, which represent 58.2% and 88.0% of the assets and revenues of the aggregate
discretely presented component units, respectively. Those financial statements were audited by other
auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinions, insofar as they relate to the amounts
included for those entities, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors. We conducted our audit in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller
General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s

Independent Auditors' Report • 2

internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinions.
Opinions
In our opinion, based on our audit and the reports of the other auditors, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities,
the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund
information of the City, as of June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in financial position, and where
applicable, cash flows thereof and the budgetary comparison for the City’s General Fund for the year then
ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Emphasis of Matters
Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements
As discussed in Note 2q to the financial statements, in 2018, the City adopted Governmental Accounting
Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment
Benefits Other Than Pensions. Our opinions are not modified with respect to this matters.
Other Matters
Prior-Year Comparative Information
The financial statements include partial prior-year comparative information related to the budgetary
comparison for the City’s General Fund. Such information does not include all of the information required
for a presentation in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, such
information should be read in conjunction with the City’s financial statements for the year ended June 30,
2017, from which such partial information was derived.
Required Supplementary Information
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that the management’s discussion and analysis and
the schedules listed under Required Supplementary Information in the table of contents, be presented to
supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial
statements, is required by the GASB who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for
placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We
and the other auditors have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of
inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for
consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other
knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or
provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient
evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.
Other Information
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively
comprise the City’s basic financial statements. The introductory section, combining, individual fund
statements and schedules, and statistical section are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are
not a required part of the basic financial statements.
The combining, individual fund statements and schedules are the responsibility of management and were
derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic
financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit

3 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling
such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial
statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America by us and other auditors. In our
opinion, based on our audit, the procedures performed as described above, and the reports of the other
auditors, the combining, individual fund statements and schedules are fairly stated in all material respects
in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.
We also previously audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America and Government Auditing Standards, the City’s basic financial statements as of and for the year
ended June 30, 2017 (not presented herein), and have issued our report thereon dated December 27,
2017, which contained unmodified opinions on the respective financial statements of the governmental
activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate
remaining fund information, based on our audit and the reports of other auditors. The 2017 combining,
individual fund statements and schedules are presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a
required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and
was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the
2017 financial statements. The 2017 combining, individual fund statements and schedules have been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the 2017 basic financial statements and certain
additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying
accounting and other records used to prepare those financial statements or to those financial statements
themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America. In our opinion, based on our audit and the reports of other auditors, the 2017
combining, individual fund statements and schedules are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to
the basic financial statements as a whole for the year ended June 30, 2017.
The introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the
audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any
assurance on them.
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated December 24,
2018 on our consideration of the City’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other
matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over
financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the
effectiveness of the City’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an
integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the
City’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
(Unaudited)
The City of Boston (the City) provides this Management’s Discussion and Analysis to present additional information to the
readers of the City’s basic financial statements. This narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the City is
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Readers are encouraged to consider this information in conjunction with the
additional information that is furnished in the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR).

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the City’s financial statements. The City’s basic financial
statements include three components: 1) Government-wide Financial Statements, 2) Fund Financial Statements, and 3)
Notes to the Financial Statements. This report also contains required supplementary information regarding historical pension
information and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plan information. The components of the financial statements are
described in the following sections.
Basic Financial Statements
The basic financial statements include two types of financial statements that present different views of the City – the
Government-wide Financial Statements and the Fund Financial Statements. The Notes to the Basic Financial Statements
supplement the financial statement information and clarify line items that are part of the financial statements.
Government-wide Financial Statements
The Government-wide Financial Statements provide a broad view of the City’s operations in a manner similar to a private
sector business. The statements provide both short-term and long-term information about the City’s financial position,
which assists in assessing the City’s economic condition at the end of the fiscal year. These are prepared using the economic
resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. This basically means they follow methods that are similar
to those used by most businesses. They take into account all revenues and expenses connected with the fiscal year even if
cash involved has not been received or paid. The Government-wide Financial Statements include two statements:
The Statement of Net Position presents all of the government’s assets and deferred outflows of resources and liabilities
and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between them reported as net position. Over time, increases or
decreases in the City’s net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the City is improving
or deteriorating.
The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the government’s net position changed during the most
recent fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs,
regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this statement for some items
that will not result in cash flows until future fiscal periods (such as uncollected taxes and earned but unused vacation leave).
This statement also presents a comparison between direct expenses and program revenues for each function of the City.
Both the above financial statements present two separate sections as described below.
Governmental Activities – The activities in this section are mostly supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues
(federal and state grants). Most services normally associated with city government fall into this category, including general
government, human services, public safety, public works, property and development, parks and recreation, library, schools,
public health programs, state and district assessments, and debt service.

5 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Discretely Presented Component Units – These are legally separate entities for which the City has financial accountability
but function independent of the City. For the most part, these entities operate similar to private sector businesses. The
City’s four discretely presented component units are the Boston Public Health Commission, the Boston Development &
Planning Agency, the Economic Development Industrial Corporation, and the Trustees of the Boston Public Library.
Complete financial statements of the individual component units can be obtained from their respective administrative
offices. Additional information about the City’s component units is presented in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
The Government-wide Financial Statements can be found immediately following this discussion and analysis.
Fund Financial Statements
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for
specific activities or objectives. The City, like other local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate
compliance with finance-related legal requirements.
The Fund Financial Statements focus on individual parts of the City government, reporting the City’s operations in more
detail than the Government-wide Financial Statements. All of the funds of the City can be divided into three categories. It
is important to note that these fund categories use different accounting approaches and should be interpreted differently.
The three categories of funds are:
Governmental Funds – Most of the basic services provided by the City are financed through governmental funds.
Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in the
Government-wide Financial Statements. However, unlike the Government-wide Financial Statements, the Governmental
Fund Financial Statements focus on near term inflows and outflows of spendable resources. They also focus on the balances
of spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in evaluating the government’s
near term financing requirements. This approach is known as using the flow of current financial resources measurement
focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this approach, revenues are recorded when cash is received or
when susceptible to accrual (i.e., measurable and available to liquidate liabilities of the current period). Expenditures are
generally recorded when liabilities are incurred, except for those related to long-term liabilities, which are recorded when
due and payable. These statements provide a detailed short term view of the City’s finances to assist in determining whether
there will be adequate financial resources available to meet the current needs of the City.
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the Government-wide Financial Statements, it is useful
to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental
activities in the Government-wide Financial Statements. By doing so, readers may better understand the long term impact
of the government’s near term financing decisions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund
statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison
between governmental funds and the governmental activities. These reconciliations are presented on the page immediately
following each governmental fund financial statement.
The City presents four columns in the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues,
expenditures, and changes in fund balances. The City’s three major governmental funds are the General Fund, the Special
Revenue Fund, and the Capital Projects Fund. All non-major governmental funds are combined in the “Other Governmental
Funds” column on these statements. The Governmental Fund Financial Statements can be found immediately following the
Government-wide Financial Statements.

Management's Discussion & Analysis • 6

Of the City’s governmental funds, the General Fund is the only fund for which a budget is legally adopted. The Statement
of Revenues and Expenditures – Budgetary Basis is presented after the governmental fund financial statements. This
statement provides a comparison of the General Fund original and final budget and the actual expenditures for the current
and prior year on a budgetary basis.
In accordance with state law and regulations, the City’s legally adopted General Fund budget is prepared on a “budgetary”
basis instead of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Among the key differences between these two sets
of accounting principles are that “budgetary” records property tax as it is levied, while GAAP records it as it becomes
susceptible to accrual, “budgetary” records certain activities and transactions in the General Fund that GAAP records in
separate funds, and “budgetary” records any amount raised to cover a prior year deficit as an expenditure and any available
funds raised from prior year surpluses as a revenue, while GAAP ignores these impacts from prior years. The difference in
accounting principles inevitably leads to varying results in excess or deficiency of revenues over expenditures. Additional
information and a reconciliation of “budgetary” to GAAP statements is provided in note 4 to the Financial Statements.
Proprietary Funds – These funds are used to show activities that operate more like those of commercial enterprises. Like
the Government-wide Financial Statements, Proprietary Fund Financial Statements use the economic resources
measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting. There are two types of proprietary funds – enterprise funds and internal
service funds. Enterprise funds charge fees for services provided to outside customers including local governments.
Enterprise Funds provide the same type of information as the business-type activities of the Government-wide Financial
Statements within governmental activities, only in more detail. Currently, the City does not have any enterprise funds. The
Internal Service Fund provides health insurance services predominantly to other funds, departments or agencies of the
City. Therefore, its activities are included in the Government-wide financial statements within governmental activities.
The Proprietary Funds Financial Statements can be found immediately following the Governmental Fund Financial
Statements.
Fiduciary Funds – These funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the City government.
Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the Government-wide Financial Statements because the resources of these funds are
not available to support the City’s own programs. The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for
proprietary funds. They use the economic resources measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting.
The City’s fiduciary funds are the Employee Retirement Fund (the Boston Retirement System), which accounts for the
transactions, assets, liabilities, and net position of the City employees’ pension plan; the Other Postemployment Benefits
(OPEB) Trust Fund, which is an irrevocable trust established for the accumulation of assets to reduce the liability associated
with the City’s obligation for other postemployment benefits; and the Private Purpose Trust and Agency Funds, which include
money held and administered by the City on behalf of third parties.
The Fiduciary Funds Financial Statements can be found immediately following the Proprietary Fund Financial Statements.
Notes to the Financial Statements
The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the Governmentwide and the Fund Financial Statements. The Notes to the Financial Statements can be found immediately following the
Fiduciary Funds Financial Statements.
Required Supplementary Information
The basic financial statements are followed by a section of required supplementary information, which includes a schedule
of funding progress and a schedule of employer contributions for the OPEB Trust Fund, a schedule of changes in net OPEB

7 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

liability and related ratios, a schedule of the City’s proportionate share of the net pension liability of the Boston Retirement
System, and a schedule of the City’s contributions to the Boston Retirement System.

CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL IMPACTS
The City of Boston’s OPEB obligation significantly impacts the Government-wide financial results. In fiscal year 2018,
The City implemented GASB 75, "Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits other than
pensions." The most recent valuation of the City’s OPEB obligation as of June 30, 2017, estimated that the total
OPEB liability of the City increased by $36.0 million to $2.3 billion. This increase was largely as a result of increasing
costs.
In fiscal year 2018, the City’s contribution to the OPEB Trust Fund ($164.6 million) for retiree health benefits includes
$40.0 million in advance funding toward reducing the OPEB liability. The ADC was not met in 2018 resulting in an
increase in the net OPEB obligation. In fiscal year 2019, the City has also appropriated $40.0 million in advance
funding toward reducing the OPEB liability.
With the implementation of GASB Statement No. 75, the City is required to report a net OPEB liability and OPEB
expense as it relates to the benefits provisions of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32B. As a result of the
implementation of GASB Statement No. 75, beginning net position of the governmental activities as of July 1, 2017
was restated (reduced) by approximately $1.4 billion.
The City of Boston’s net pension liability significantly impacts the Government-wide financial results. With the
implementation of GASB Statement No. 68 in fiscal year 2015, the City is required to report its proportionate share
of the Boston Retirement System's collective net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows
of resources, and pension expense. In addition, the City is also required to report a net pension liability, deferred
outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources and pension expense related to its non-contributory retirement
plan. Based on the measurement of the Boston Retirement System's net pension liability as of December 31, 2017,
the City's proportionate share of that net pension liability decreased by $196 million and the net pension liability
for the City's non contributory plan decreased by $4.3 million resulting on a total net pension liability of $1.37
billion.

GOVERNMENT-WIDE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
This analysis is based on the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities found directly after Management’s
Discussion and Analysis.
Government-wide Highlights
Net Position – Primary Government – The total liabilities and deferred inflows of resources of the City exceeded its assets
and deferred outflows of resources at fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 resulting in a net deficit of $1.74 billion (presented
as net position). At year end, the City had a deficit in governmental activities unrestricted net position in the amount of
$2.45 billion.
Changes in Net Position – Primary Government – The City’s total net position increased by $135.0 million from the amount
reported in fiscal year 2017.

Management's Discussion & Analysis • 8

Net Position
As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government’s financial position. The City’s net
deficit totaled $1.74 billion at the end of 2018, compared to a net deficit of $1.88 billion, (restated) reported at the end of
the previous year.
The components of net position comprise the following: the investment in capital assets such as land, buildings, equipment,
and infrastructure (road, bridges, and other immovable assets), less any related debt used to acquire those assets that are
still outstanding – this amount is $685.0 million indicating that the net book value of the City’s capital assets exceeds the
amount of related capital debt outstanding. The City uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens; consequentially,
these assets are not available for future spending. Although the City’s investment in its capital assets is reported net of
related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since
the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.
A portion of the City’s governmental activities net position, $75.1 million, represents restricted net position, or resources
that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used. Internally imposed designations of resources are not
presented as restricted net assets. The unrestricted net position increased by $76.4 million from the 2017 restated amount
of $2.6 billion.

Governmental Activities
The City’s governmental activities net position increased by $135.0 million over the prior fiscal year. The following net
changes occurred during the course of operations in fiscal year 2018. In the assets accounts, cash and investments increased
by $241.8 million, receivables decreased by $33.2 million, and capital assets increased by $51.8 million. In the liability
accounts, there was a increase in warrants and accounts payable of $16.7 million and a increase in accrued liabilities of
$62.2 million. Additionally, an increase of $36.0 million was recorded relative to the City’s other postemployment benefit
obligation and a decrease of $195.7 million was recorded relative to the City's net pension liability in 2018.
During fiscal year 2018, the City’s revenues increased by 6.3%. The City’s largest sources of revenues were property taxes,
excise taxes, and payment in lieu of taxes of $2.54 billion (65.8% of total revenues) and $1.07 billion of program revenues
(27.6% of total revenues). Taxes increased by $162.3 million from the previous year. Program revenues increased by $44.6
million for fiscal year 2018. This is largely due to increases in operating grants and contributions. The City’s expenses cover
a range of services. The largest expenses were for schools ($1.93 billion), public safety ($1.05 billion), general government
($156.7 million), public works ($163.3 million), and property and development ($137.3 million). In 2018, governmental
activities expenses exceeded program revenues (i.e., user charges, operating grants, and capital grants) by $2.66 billion.
This shortfall was covered primarily through taxes ($2.54 billion) and unrestricted grants and contributions ($214.1 million).
Comparative data on these revenues and expenses is itemized in the reporting of the Changes in Net Position – Primary
Government earlier in this Management Discussion and Analysis.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE CITY’S FUND STATEMENTS
This analysis is based on the Governmental and Proprietary Fund Financial Statements. As noted earlier, the City uses fund
accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance related legal requirements.
Fund Highlights
Governmental Funds – Fund Balances – as of the close of fiscal year 2018, the City’s governmental funds reported a combined
ending fund balance of $1.61 billion, an increase of $158.7 million from the prior year. Of this total amount, $781.4 million
represents the unassigned fund balance. The increase in fund balance is largely due to an increase in property and excise
taxes and intergovernmental revenue.
Governmental Funds
The focus of the City’s governmental funds is to provide information on near term inflows, outflows, and balances of
spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the City’s financial requirements. In particular, unassigned fund
balance may serve as a useful measure of a government’s financial position at the end of the fiscal year.
General Fund – Fund Balance – The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the City. The City’s General Fund – Fund
Balance Policy states in part to maintain a GAAP unassigned fund balance in the General Fund that is 15%, or higher, of
GAAP General Fund operating expenditures for the fiscal year. The GAAP unassigned fund balance at the end of fiscal year
2018 was $781.4 million, which represents approximately 23.9% of GAAP General Fund operating expenditures.
However, because the City is required to follow the statutory basis of accounting rather than GAAP for determining the
amount of unassigned fund balance that can be appropriated, it is the statutory (not the GAAP) fund balance that is used
to calculate “free cash”. Free cash is the amount of statutory fund balance in the General Fund, as certified by the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ Department of Revenue, which is available for appropriation and is generated when
actual revenues, on a cash basis, exceed budgeted amounts and encumbrances are less than appropriations, or both.

13 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

The City has established the General Fund-Fund Balance Policy to ensure that the City maintains adequate levels of fund
balance to mitigate current and future risks (i.e., revenue shortfalls and unanticipated expenditures). The policy in full states
that the City shall maintain a GAAP Unassigned Fund Balance in the General Fund that is 15% or higher than the current
fiscal year’s GAAP General Fund Operating Expenditures. The City shall only consider the certification of Free Cash (as
defined by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ Department of Revenue) in years where the appropriation of Free Cash
shall not cause the fiscal year’s GAAP Unassigned Fund Balance to go below 15% of the fiscal year’s GAAP General Fund
Operating Expenditures, while maintaining a Budgetary Unassigned Fund Balance at 10% or higher of Budgetary Operating
Expenditures. The City shall only consider the appropriation of Certified Free Cash to offset: (1) certain fixed costs such as
pension contributions and related post-retirement health benefits; and/or (2) to fund extraordinary and non-recurring
events as determined and certified by the City Auditor.
Special Revenue Fund – Fund Balance – The Special Revenue Fund accounts for the proceeds of specific revenue sources
that are restricted or committed to expenditures for predefined purposes. The fiscal year 2018 Special Revenue Fund balance
is reported at $247.4 million, a $8.0 million decrease from fiscal year 2017.
Capital Projects Fund – Fund Balance – The Capital Projects Fund accounts for financial resources to be used for the
acquisition or construction of major capital facilities, other than those financed by proprietary funds and trust funds. The
fiscal year 2018 Capital Projects Fund balance is $183.3 million, a $62.0 million increase from fiscal year 2017 due to the
issuance of bonds in the current year.
Other Governmental Funds – Fund Balance – Other Governmental Funds account for assets held by the City in permanent
trust funds, as well as the activities related to DSRC and FBDC. The fiscal year 2018 Other Governmental Funds fund balance
is $101.9 million, a $7.9 million increase from fiscal year 2017.
Internal Service Fund
The City’s Internal Service Fund accounts for the City’s self-insurance program for health benefits provided by Blue Cross
Blue Shield, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and Tufts for City employees and their dependents. The Internal Service Fund is
included as part of the governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements.
Budgetary Highlights
General Fund budgetary highlights include ending fiscal year 2018 with a $21.2 million surplus. There were no material
variances between the original budget and final budget amounts. Unfavorable variances from the final budget to actual
results occurred in public safety, judgments and claims, and public works.
Favorable results were reported for General Fund revenue sources, including $15.6 million in payments in lieu of taxes,
$11.5 million in departmental and other revenue, $66.2 million in excises and $13.4 million in investment income. Other
available funds shows a revenue deficit of $63.5 million, however, this is a result of not transferring $22.5 million of parking
meter funds and $40.95 million of free cash from the general fund.

Management's Discussion & Analysis • 14

CAPITAL ASSETS AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS
Capital Assets
The City’s investment in capital assets for its governmental activities, as of June 30, 2018, has a net book value of $2.14
billion, made up of costs totaling $4.23 billion less accumulated depreciation of $2.09 billion. This investment in capital
assets includes land, buildings, improvements, equipment, infrastructure, and construction in progress. Infrastructure assets
are items that are normally immovable and have value only to the City, such as roads, bridges, streets, sidewalks, drainage
systems, lighting systems, and similar items.
The total increase in the City’s investment in capital assets for the current fiscal year was approximately $51.8 million in
terms of net book value. However, actual expenditures to purchase or construct capital assets and contributions of capital
assets were $201.9 million for the fiscal year. Most of this amount was used for the purpose of constructing or reconstructing
buildings and building improvements and infrastructure. Depreciation charges for the year totaled $150.1 million. Additional
information on the City’s capital assets can be found in note 8 to the Financial Statements.
Long Term Obligations
Debt Administration – The authority of the City to incur debt is governed by federal and state laws that restrict the amounts
and purposes for which a municipality can incur debt. At year end, the City had $1.31 billion in General Obligations Bonds
principal outstanding – an increase of $30.0 million over last year.
On May 30, 2018, the City issued $150.0 million in Series A general obligation bonds to finance various capital projects in
the City. In conjunction with the City’s annual bond offering, the rating service bureau Moody’s Investors Service reaffirmed
the City’s bond ratings at Aaa and the rating service bureau Standard & Poor’s reaffirmed the bond rating to AAA. General
Obligation Bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the City, including the City’s power to levy additional taxes to
ensure repayment of debt. Accordingly, all general obligation debt currently outstanding has been approved by a vote of
the City Council.
Notes and Leases Payable and Other Long Term Obligations – The City’s general long term notes and leases and other long
term obligations decreased $141.2 million, or 3.22%, during the current fiscal year. Key factors for this decrease are a
decrease in the net pension liability of $200.4 million and an increase in the net OPEB obligation of $36.0 million.
Additional information on the City’s long term debt obligations can be found in note 10 to the Financial Statements.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The GASB has issued GASB Statement No. 75, "Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than
Pensions." The primary objective of this Statement is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local
governments for OPEB. It also improves information provided by state and local governmental employers about financial
support for OPEB that is provided by other entities. This Statement replaces the requirements of Statements No. 45,
"Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions, as amended", and
No. 57, "OPEB Measurements by Agent Employers and Agent Multiple-Employer Plans, for OPEB." This Statement was
implemented in fiscal 2018.
The GASB has issued Statement No. 85 "Omnibus 2017." The objective of this Statement is to address practice issues that
have been identified during implementation and application of certain GASB Statements. This Statement addresses a variety
of topics including issues related to blending component units, goodwill, fair value measurement and application, and
postemployment benefits (pensions and other postemployment benefits [OPEB]). This Statement was implemented in fiscal
2018 without any material impact.

15 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

The GASB has issued Statement No. 86 "Certain Debt Extinguishment Issues." The primary objective of this Statement is to
improve consistency in accounting and financial reporting for in-substance defeasance of debt by providing guidance for
transactions in which cash and other monetary assets acquired with only existing resources-resources other than the
proceeds of refunding debt-are placed in an irrevocable trust for the sole purpose of extinguishing debt. This Statement
also improves accounting and financial reporting for prepaid insurance on debt that is extinguished and notes to financial
statements for debt that is defeased in substance. This Statement was implemented in fiscal 2018 without any material
impact.

FUTURE PRONOUNCEMENTS
The GASB has issued Statement No. 83 "Certain Asset Retirement Obligations." This Statement addresses accounting and
financial reporting for certain asset retirement obligations (AROs). An ARO is a legally enforceable liability associated with
the retirement of a tangible capital asset. A government that has legal obligations to perform future asset retirement
activities related to its tangible capital assets should recognize a liability based on the guidance in this Statement. The
requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2018. Earlier application is
encouraged.
The GASB has issued Statement No. 84 "Fiduciary Activities." The objective of this Statement is to improve guidance regarding
the identification of fiduciary activities for accounting and financial reporting purposes and how those activities should be
reported. This Statement establishes criteria for identifying fiduciary activities of all state and local governments. The focus
of the criteria generally is on (1) whether a government is controlling the assets of the fiduciary activity and (2) the
beneficiaries with whom a fiduciary relationship exists. Separate criteria are included to identify fiduciary component units
and postemployment benefit arrangements that are fiduciary activities. The requirements of this Statement are effective
for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is encouraged.
The GASB has issued Statement No. 87 "Leases." The objective of this Statement is to better meet the information needs
of financial statement users by improving accounting and financial reporting for leases by governments. This Statement
increases the usefulness of governments’ financial statements by requiring recognition of certain lease assets and liabilities
for leases that previously were classified as operating leases and recognized as inflows of resources or outflows of resources
based on the payment provisions of the contract. It establishes a single model for lease accounting based on the foundational
principle that leases are financings of the right to use an underlying asset. Under this Statement, a lessee is required to
recognize a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset, and a lessor is required to recognize a lease receivable
and a deferred inflow of resources, thereby enhancing the relevance and consistency of information about governments’
leasing activities. The requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019.
Earlier application is encouraged.
The GASB has issued Statement No. 88 "Certain Disclosures Related to Debt, including Direct Borrowings and Direct
Placements". The primary objective of this Statement is to improve the information that is disclosed in notes to government
financial statements related to debt, including direct borrowings and direct placements. It also clarifies which liabilities
governments should include when disclosing information related to debt. The requirements of this Statement are effective
for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2018. Earlier application is encouraged.
The GASB has issued Statement No. 89 "Accounting for Interest Cost Incurred before the End of a Construction Period". The
objectives of this Statement are (1) to enhance the relevance and comparability of information about capital assets and the
cost of borrowing for a reporting period and (2) to simplify accounting for interest cost incurred before the end of a
construction period. The requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2019. Earlier application is encouraged.

Management's Discussion & Analysis • 16

The GASB has issued GASB Statement No. 90, "Majority Equity Interests-an amendment of GASB Statements No. 14 and
No. 61". The primary objectives of this Statement are to improve the consistency and comparability of reporting a
government’s majority equity interest in a legally separate organization and to improve the relevance of financial statement
information for certain component units. The requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is encouraged.

Year Ended June 30, 2018
(Amounts in thousands)
Net change in fund balances - total governmental funds

$

158,722

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of activities are different
because:
Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. In the statement of activities,
the cost of those assets is depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Capital outlays and
contributions of capital assets ($ 201,938) exceeded depreciation expense ($ 150,085) and
loss on disposals ($ 94)

51,758

Certain revenues in the statement of activities that are not reported as revenues in the
governmental funds as they are not considered available

(1,151)

Issuances of long-term debt ($ 176,698) increase long-term liabilities in the statement of net
position, but are included in the operating statement of the governmental funds.
Repayment of bonds, notes and lease principal ($ 153,445) are expenditures in the
governmental funds, but reduce long-term liabilities in the statement of net position. This
is the amount by which issuances exceed repayments

Decreases in bond premiums net ($ 10,519) decrease the long-term liabilities in the

31 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2018

1. The Financial Reporting Entity
a. Primary Government
The City of Boston (the City), incorporated as a town in 1630 and as a city in 1822, now exists under
Chapter 486 of the Act of 1909 and Chapter 452 of the Acts of 1948 of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
(the Commonwealth), which, as amended, constitute the City’s Charter. The Mayor is elected to a four year
term and serves as chief executive officer of the City. The Mayor has general supervision of and control
over the City’s boards, commissions, officers, and departments. The legislative body of the City is the City
Council, which consists of 13 elected members serving two year terms.
The accompanying basic financial statements present the City and its component units. The component
units discussed below are included in the City’s reporting entity because of the significance of their
operational or financial relationships with the City.
b. Blended Component Units Disclosure
i. Boston Retirement System (BRS) is a defined benefit contributory retirement system created under
state statute. It is administered by a Retirement Board comprising five members: the City Auditor,
who serves ex officio; two individuals elected by participants in the system; a fourth member
appointed by the Mayor; and a fifth member chosen by the other members. BRS provides pension
benefits to retired City, Boston Planning & Development Agency, Boston Housing Authority, Boston
Water and Sewer Commission, and Boston Public Health Commission employees. Although legally
separate, BRS provides services entirely, or almost entirely, to the City and thus has been reported
as a blended component unit among the City’s fiduciary funds. The financial statements of BRS are
included for its fiscal year end which is December 31, 2017.
ii. Dudley Square Realty Corporation (DSRC) and Ferdinand Building Development Corporation
(FBDC) – The DSRC is a Qualified Active Low-Income Community Business, and is the owner and
developer of the Dudley Municipal Center property. FBDC is the leverage lender of the Dudley
Municipal Center property. FBDC leases the property from DSRC and the City subleases the property
from FBDC. The DSRC and FBDC are non-profit organizations qualified as tax-exempt entities under
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Both entities are instrumentalities of the City, as
the Mayor has full control of appointments to their boards of directors. Although legally separate,
both DSRC and FBDC provide services entirely, or almost entirely, to the City and thus have been
reported as blended component units. These funds are presented as non-major funds within the
other governmental funds as of their fiscal year end, which is June 30, 2018.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • 32

c. Discretely Presented Component Units Disclosure
These component units are reported in a separate column to emphasize that they are legally separate from
the City but are included because the City is financially accountable for the organizations, meaning it
appoints, at a minimum, a voting majority of the board of directors of the organization and is able to impose
its will on the organizations or has a financial benefit or burden relationship with the organizations. Unless
otherwise indicated, the Notes to the Financial Statements pertain only to the primary government because
certain disclosures of the component units are not significant relative to the total component units and to
the primary government. A description of the component units, criteria for inclusion, and their relationship
with the City are as follows:
i.

Boston Planning & Development Agency (BPDA) – The BPDA is legally separate from the City and
a body politic and corporate constituting the City’s redevelopment authority and exercising the
powers of a planning board for the City. The BPDA is governed by a five-member board, four of
whom are appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council, and one of whom is appointed
by the Governor of Massachusetts (same board members as the EDIC). The BPDA receives a
significant amount of intergovernmental revenue, which is used solely for capital projects that are
under the oversight of the BPDA. In accordance with GASB Statement No. 61, the BPDA is presented
as a discrete component unit of the City.

ii. Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston (EDIC) – The EDIC is legally separate
from the City and a body politic and corporate and an instrumentality of the Commonwealth. The
EDIC is governed by a five-member board, four of whom are appointed by the Mayor and confirmed
by the City Council, and one of whom is appointed by the Governor of Massachusetts (same board
members as the BPDA). The EDIC receives a significant amount of intergovernmental revenue,
including grants and contracts with the City for jobs and community service activities. In accordance
with GASB Statement No. 61, the EDIC is presented as a discrete component unit of the City.
iii. Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) – The BPHC is legally separate from the City and a body
politic and corporate and an instrumentality of the Commonwealth. The BPHC is governed by a
seven-member board, six of whom are appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council,
and one of whom is the chief executive officer of the Boston Medical Center. The BPHC receives
the majority of its funding from a City appropriation, EMS and other third party billings, and federal
and state grants. The BPHC expects that the City will continue to provide support for the public
health programs of the BPHC. In accordance with GASB Statement No. 61, the BPHC is presented
as a discrete component unit of the City.
iv. Trustees of the Public Library of the City of Boston (TPL) – The TPL is legally separate from the City
of Boston and is a non-profit organization qualified as a tax-exempt entity under Section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code. The trustees of the TPL are appointed by the Mayor and the TPL
places substantial reliance upon the City to fund its daily operations. In addition, the Library receives
significant support through state and federal government appropriations and private sources. In
accordance with GASB Statement No. 61, the TPL is presented as a discrete component unit of the
City.
The financial statements of the discretely presented component units are included for their respective fiscal
year ends, which is June 30, 2018.

33 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Complete financial statements of these discretely presented component units can be obtained through the
City Auditor’s office, Room M 4, City Hall Plaza, Boston, Massachusetts 02201. In addition, condensed
financial statements for the discretely presented component units are included in note 20.
d. Related Organizations
The Mayor is also responsible for appointing members of the governing bodies of the Boston Housing
Authority, Boston Industrial Development Finance Authority, and Boston Water and Sewer Commission;
however, the City’s accountability for these organizations does not extend beyond making these
appointments.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies of the City conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as applicable
to governmental units as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The following
is a summary of the more significant policies followed by the City:
a. Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements
The Government-wide Financial Statements (i.e., the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of
Activities) report information on all of the nonfiduciary activities of the primary government and its
component units. For the most part, the effect of interfund activity has been removed from these
statements. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes and intergovernmental
revenues, are reported separately from any business type activities, which rely to a significant extent
on fees and charges for support. The City currently reports no business-type activities. Likewise, the
primary government is reported separately from certain legally separate component units for which the
primary government is financially accountable.
The Statement of Activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function
or segment is offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a
specific function or segment. Program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants who
purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function or
segment and 2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital
requirements of a particular function or segment. Taxes and other items not properly included among
program revenues are reported instead as general revenues.
Separate financial statements are provided for Governmental Funds, Proprietary Funds, and Fiduciary
Funds, even though the latter are excluded from the Government-wide Financial Statements. Major
individual Governmental Funds are reported as separate columns in the Fund Financial Statements.
b. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation
i.
Government-wide Financial Statements
The Government-wide Financial Statements are reported using the economic resources
measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the Proprietary Fund and
Fiduciary Fund Financial Statements. The Agency Fund within the Fiduciary Fund Financial
Statements has no measurement of results. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses
are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property
taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied. Grants and similar items
are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements for recognition have been met.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • 34

ii.

Governmental Fund Financial Statements
Governmental Fund Financial Statements are reported using the current financial resources
measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as
soon as they are “susceptible to accrual” (i.e., both measurable and available). Revenues not
considered to be available are recorded as deferred inflows of resources.
The City applies the susceptible to accrual criteria to property and other taxes and
intergovernmental revenues. In applying the susceptible to accrual concept to
intergovernmental revenues, there are essentially two types of revenues. In one, resources must
be expended on the specific purpose or project before any amounts will be reimbursed to the
City; therefore, revenues are recognized based upon the amount of expenditures incurred
subject to availability requirements. In the other, resources are virtually unrestricted and are
usually revocable by the grantor only for failure to comply with prescribed compliance
requirements. These resources are reflected as revenues at the time of receipt or earlier if the
susceptible to accrual criteria are met. Property and other taxes are recognized as revenue in
the year for which taxes have been levied or earned, provided they are collected within 60 days
after year-end. Generally, intergovernmental revenues are recognized as revenue provided they
are earned during the year and collected within one year after year-end, except for
Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) and Chapter 90 receivables which are
considered available when received.
Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred. However, debt service
expenditures, as well as expenditures related to long-term liabilities including compensated
absences, other postemployment benefits, workers’ compensation and judgments and claims,
are recorded only when payment is mature and due.

iii.

Proprietary Fund Financial Statements
Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from nonoperating items.
Operating revenues and expenses generally result from the provision of services. The principal
operating revenues of the City’s Internal Service Funds are receipts from employer and
employees for health insurance premiums. Operating expenses for the Internal Service Fund
include administrative expenses, vendor payments, and health benefits. Any revenues and
expenses not meeting this definition are reported as nonoperating revenues and expenses.

iv.

Description of Major Funds
Governmental funds – The City reports the following major governmental funds:
1.
The General Fund is the City’s primary operating fund. It accounts for all financial
resources of the general government, except those required to be accounted for in
another fund.
2.
The Special Revenue Fund accounts for the proceeds of specific revenue sources (other
than trusts for individuals, private organizations, or other governments, or for major
capital projects) that are legally restricted or assigned to expenditures for various general
governmental functions. Revenue sources include grant funding for education, housing,
and public safety and 1% surcharge on the newly adopted Community Preservation Act.
3.
The Capital Projects Fund accounts for bond proceeds and grant revenues used for the
acquisition or construction of the City’s capital facilities.
Proprietary fund –The City reports the following proprietary fund:
4.
The City uses an internal service fund to account for its self insured health costs.
Although the fund is presented in a separate column in the accompanying proprietary
fund financial statements, it is not considered a major fund.

35 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Fiduciary Funds – The City reports the following fiduciary fund types:
5.
The Private Purpose Trust Funds are used to account for resources legally held in trust
for the benefit of individuals, private organizations, or other governments. The City
operates four pools used for the improvement of the City’s parks and cemeteries,
educational scholarships and sporting equipment, creation of public utility and beauty,
and co-mingled nontestamentary trusts.
6.
The Pension Trust Fund accounts principally for the activities of the Boston Retirement
System, a blended component unit, which accumulates resources for pension benefit
payments to retired employees of the City and other entities.
7.
The OPEB Trust Fund is an irrevocable trust fund established for other postemployment
benefits. The assets are appropriated from the General Fund and accumulate to reduce
the City's total OPEB liability. The assets of the trust are currently not used for direct
payments of benefits.
8.
The Agency Funds are used to report funds held by the City in a purely custodial capacity.
The City currently operates a drug evidence account for proceeds of property seized
from illegal drug-related activities. These funds are then used to offset the costs of
technical equipment or expertise and investigations.
c. Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, investments with original maturities of three months or
less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.
d. Basis of Investment Valuation
Investments generally are presented in the accompanying basic financial statements at fair value. Where
applicable, fair values are based on quotations from national securities exchanges, except for certain
investments of BRS, which are described in notes 5 and 11. Further, income from investments is
recognized in the same fund as the related investments.
The City invests in the Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust (MMDT) Cash Portfolio, which is an
external investment pool and is not SEC-registered. The fund is state-regulated and is valued at amortized
cost.
e. Interfund Receivables and Payables
Activity between funds that are representative of lending/borrowing arrangements outstanding at the
end of the fiscal year are referred to as either “due to/from other funds” (i.e., the current portion of
interfund loans) or “advances to/from other funds” (i.e., the noncurrent portion of interfund loans). All
other outstanding balances between funds are reported as “due to/from other funds.”
f.

Uncollectible Tax and Other Receivables
All receivables are shown net of an allowance for uncollectibles. Amounts considered to be uncollectible
are based on the type and age of the related receivable.

g. Capital Assets
Capital assets include property, plant, equipment, and infrastructure assets (e.g., roads, bridges,
sidewalks, and similar items), and intangible assets such as easements, land use rights, computer
software, trademarks and patents. Capital assets are reported in the governmental activities column in
the Government-wide Financial Statements. Capital assets are defined by the City as assets with an
initial, individual cost of more than $25,000 and an estimated useful life in excess of one year. Such assets
are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical cost if purchased or constructed. Donated capital
assets are recorded at acquisition value at the date of donation. Any significant construction
commitments are encumbered at year end in the City’s Capital Projects Fund.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • 36

The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the capacity or efficiency of the asset
or materially extend assets’ useful lives are not capitalized.
Capital assets of the primary government are depreciated using the straight line method over the
following estimated useful lives:

Buildings
Building improvements
Infrastructure
Land improvements - major
Land improvements - playgrounds
Computer upgrades
Equipment and machinery
Intangible assets, computer software and licenses

h. Compensated Absences
Employees are granted sick and vacation leave in varying amounts. Upon retirement, termination, or
death, certain employees are compensated for unused sick and vacation leave (subject to certain
limitations) at their then current rates of pay. Public Safety employees are compensated for unused
personal leave in addition to sick and vacation leave. The portion of the liability related to unused sick
and vacation time that has matured or is due as of June 30, 2018 is recorded in the Governmental Fund
Financial Statements. The entire amount of the liability is reported in governmental activities in the
Government-wide Financial Statements. The liability for vacation leave is based on the amount earned
but not used; for sick leave, it is based on the amount accumulated at the balance sheet date that would
be paid upon termination (vesting method). The liability for both amounts is calculated based on the
pay or salary rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
i.

Long Term Obligations and Related Costs
Long-term debt and other long term obligations are reported as liabilities in the Government-wide
Statement of Net Position. Bond premiums and discounts are capitalized and amortized over the life of
the bonds using the straight line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The
unamortized portion is presented in the Government-wide Statement of Net Position as a component
of bonds payable. Bond issuance costs are reported as expenses when incurred.
The Governmental Fund Financial Statements recognize bond premiums and discounts, as well as bond
issuance costs, during the period incurred. The face amount of debt issued is reported as other financing
sources. Premiums received on debt issuances are reported as other financing sources while discounts
on debt issuances are reported as other financing uses. Issuance costs, whether or not withheld from
the actual debt proceeds received, are reported as debt service expenditures.

Pensions
For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows
of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of
the BRS and additions to/deductions from the BRS fiduciary net position have been determined on the
same basis as they are reported by BRS. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of
employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms.
Investments are generally reported at fair value.

k. Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB)
For purposes of measuring the net OPEB liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows
of resources related to OPEB, and OPEB expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the
Other Postemployment Benefit Trust Fund (the Plan) and additions to/deductions from Plan's fiduciary
net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the Plan. For this purpose,
the Plan recognizes benefit payments when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms.
Investments are generally reported at fair value.
l.

Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources
Deferred outflows of resources are defined as a consumption of net assets by the government that is
applicable to a future reporting period. Deferred inflows of resources are defined as an acquisition of
net assets by the government that is applicable to a future reporting period. Deferred inflows of resources
increase net position, similar to assets, and inflows or resources decrease net position, similar to
liabilities.

m. Net Position and Fund Balance
In the Government-wide and Proprietary Fund Financial Statements, net position is reported in the
following categories:
Net investment in capital assets: Capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, and outstanding
principal balances of debt attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those
assets.
Restricted: Net position the use of which is subject to constraints imposed by external parties,
including creditors, grantors, and laws and regulations of other governments, or imposed by City
Charter or enabling legislation. Nonexpendable amounts are required to remain intact under such
constraints.
Unrestricted: Remaining net position not considered net investment in capital assets or restricted.
For purposes of net position classification, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are available
for use, it is the City’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are
needed.
In the Governmental Fund Financial Statements, fund balance is reported in the following categories:
Nonspendable: Amounts that cannot be spent because they are either not in spendable form or
they are legally or contractually required to remain intact.
Restricted: Amounts the use of which is subject to constraints imposed by external parties, including
creditors, grantors, and laws and regulations of other governments, or imposed by City Charter or
enabling legislation.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • 38

Committed: Amounts that can only be used for specific purposes pursuant to constraints imposed
by formal action of the government’s highest level of decision-making authority. For the City, this
formal action takes the form of statutes which are passed by the City Council and approved by the
Mayor.
Assigned: Amounts that are constrained by the City’s intent for use for specific purposes, but are
considered neither restricted or committed. Under M.G.L. Chapter 190, Acts of 1982, the City Auditor
has the authority to assign amounts to be used for specific purposes on behalf of the City.
Unassigned: Amounts in the general fund that are not otherwise constrained for a specific purpose
more narrow than the general operations of the City. The City maintains a formal policy that
unassigned fund balance in the General Fund be at least 15 percent of the current year’s General
Fund GAAP basis operating expenditures.
For purposes of fund balance classification, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are available
for use, it is the City’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are
needed. When unrestricted resources are used, committed resources are used first, followed by assigned
and unassigned resources, respectively.
n. Tax Abatement Refunds
Matured tax abatement refunds that are due and payable at June 30 have been recorded as a liability
in the General Fund. A liability for estimated future tax abatement refunds has been recorded in the
Government-wide Statement of Net Position.
o. Landfill Closure and Postclosure Care Costs
State and federal regulations require the City to place a final cover on its Gardner Street landfill site
when it stops accepting waste and to perform certain maintenance and monitoring functions at the site
for 30 years after closure. At June 30, 2018, 100% of the Gardner Street landfill had been capped.
The total current cost of landfill closure and postclosure care is an estimate, subject to changes resulting
from inflation, deflation, technology, or other changes in applicable laws or regulations. Such costs are
recognized as expenditures in the General Fund to the extent that they are due or matured and are
expected to be paid with expendable available financial resources. The total liability is reported in the
Government-wide Statement of Net Position. Expenditures related to the Gardner Street landfill site
postclosure care in fiscal year 2018 were $407 thousand.
p. Use of Estimates
The preparation of the accompanying basic financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

39 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

q. Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements
The City adopted Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 75, "Accounting and
Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions." The primary objective of this
Statement is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for OPEB. It
also improves information provided by state and local governmental employers about financial support
for OPEB that is provided by other entities. This Statement replaces the requirements of Statements No.
45, "Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions,
as amended", and No. 57, "OPEB Measurements by Agent Employers and Agent Multiple-Employer Plans,
for OPEB." As a result of the implementation of Statement No. 75, beginning net position of the
governmental activities was restated as follows (in thousands):

3. Short Term Debt
During fiscal year 2018, the City had no short term debt issued or outstanding.
4. Budgetary Data
The General Fund is the only fund for which a budget is legally adopted. The budgets for all departments included
in the General Fund of the City, except the School Department, are prepared under the direction of the Mayor
and City Council. The School Department budget is prepared under the direction of the School Committee.
Original and supplemental appropriations are submitted by the Mayor, approved by the City Council, and lapse
at year-end unless encumbered. The legal level of control over appropriations is at the department level.
Amendments to the original budget must be approved by the City Council, except for a reallocation of
appropriations of up to $3.0 million, which the Mayor may approve. Further, the City Auditor, with the approval
of the Mayor, may make transfers from any appropriation to any other appropriation for purposes of eliminating
deficits before closing the books for the fiscal year. After the close of the fiscal year, the City Auditor may, with
the approval of the Mayor, apply any income, taxes, and funds not disposed of and make transfers from any
appropriation to any other appropriation for the purpose of closing the accounts for the fiscal year.
The City must establish its property tax rate each year so that the resulting property tax levy will comply with
the limits required by Proposition 2 1/2 (note 6). The tax levy must equal the sum of (a) the aggregate of all
annual appropriations for expenditures; plus (b) the reserve accounts described in the following paragraph;
plus (c) provision for the prior fiscal years’ deficits, if any; less (d) the aggregate of all non-property tax revenues
projected to be received by the City, including available funds, in amounts certified or approved by the
Commonwealth for tax rate purposes.
In accordance with the 1986 amendments to the Funding Loan Act of 1982, the City has established two reserve
funds. The first is a budget reserve fund, which is required to be funded in stages to a final level of 2 1/2% of
the prior year’s overall departmental appropriations, except the School Department, by the beginning of fiscal
year 1990. It is available to be applied to extraordinary and unforeseen expenditures. The second is a separate

40 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

reserve fund of 1% to 2-1/2% of the current year appropriation of the School Department to be applied to overexpenditures in that department.
The City’s General Fund budget is prepared on a basis other than accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (GAAP). The “actual” results column in the Statement of Revenues and Expenditures
– Budgetary Basis – General Fund is presented on a “budgetary basis” to provide a meaningful comparison of
actual results with the budget. The major differences between the budget and GAAP basis, where applicable,
are that:
i. Revenues are recorded when cash is received, except for real estate and personal property taxes,
which are recorded as revenue when levied (budget), as opposed to when susceptible to accrual
(GAAP).
ii. Encumbrances and continuing appropriations are recorded as the equivalent of expenditures
(budget) but have no effect on GAAP expenditures.
iii. Certain activities and transactions are presented in separate funds (GAAP), rather than as
components of the General Fund (budget).
iv. Amounts raised for the prior years’ deficits and available funds from prior years’ surpluses are
recorded as revenue items (budget), but have no effect on GAAP revenues.
In addition, there are certain differences in classifications between revenues, expenditures, and transfers. The
following reconciliation summarizes the differences between budgetary and GAAP basis accounting principles
for the year ended June 30, 2018 (in thousands):

Deposits and Investments
State and local statutes place certain limitations on the nature of deposits and investments available to the City.
Deposits, including demand deposits, money markets, and certificates of deposit in any one financial institution,
may not exceed 60% of the capital and surplus of such institution unless collateralized by the financial institution
involved. Investments from operating cash in the general fund may be made in unconditionally guaranteed
U.S. government obligations having maturities of a year or less from the date of purchase, or through repurchase
agreements with maturities of no greater than 90 days in which the underlying securities consist of such
obligations. Other allowable investments include authorized bonds of all states, bankers’ acceptances,
commercial paper rated within the three highest classifications established by rating agencies, and units in the
MMDT. MMDT, which is an external investment pool that is overseen by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, meets the criteria established by GASB 79, "Certain External Investment Pools and Pool
Participants", to report its investments at amortized cost; therefore the City reports its investments in MMDT
at amortized cost which approximates the net asset value of $1.00 per share. MMDT has a maturity of less than
1 year and is not rated. The three highest commercial paper classifications for Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s
(S&P) are as follows:

Primary Government (except the pension trust fund)
a. Custodial Credit Risk
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of bank failure, the City’s deposits or investments may not
be returned. The City carries deposits that are fully insured by FDIC insurance or collateralized in the City’s
name. All of the City’s investments are held by third parties in the City’s name. As of June 30, 2018, the City
of Boston Trust Funds had uninsured and uncollateralized deposits and investments of $79.28 million.
b. Investment Policy
The City’s primary concern in connection with its investment activities is a concern shared by all municipal
governments: the preservation of capital. The City’s investment policy establishes a discipline in which all
of the City’s investment activities may be safely conducted while it strives to use its capital resources as
efficiently as possible. The foundation of that discipline is fixed by Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.)
c. 44, sec. 55, which prohibits Massachusetts communities from investing in certain categories of high risk
investments; limits the amount of the City’s bank deposits in any one financial institution; and establishes
qualifying criteria for banking institutions. Further, all investments held by third parties are to be held in
the City’s name.
c. Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment.
It is the City of Boston Trust Funds’ policy to limit the average duration of an actively managed fixed income
portfolio to seven years. The following is a listing of the City of Boston Trust Funds’ fixed income investments
(in thousands) and related maturity schedule (in years) as of June 30, 2018:

d. Credit Risk
It is the City of Boston Trust Funds’ policy that there shall be no specific limitation in regard to credit
worthiness of securities, except the overall average quality of each fixed income portfolio shall be AA or
better. The City of Boston Trust Funds’ fixed income investments as of June 30, 2018 were rated by S & P
and/or an equivalent national rating organization, and the ratings are presented below using the S & P

e. Concentration Risk
The City adheres to the provisions of M.G.L. c. 44, sec. 55 when managing concentration risk. M.G.L. c. 44,
sec. 55 contains several restrictions limiting where and under what circumstances the City may deposit its
funds. No investments in a single issuer exceeded 5% of the City’s investment portfolio.
f.

Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of an
investment or a deposit. As of June 30, 2018, the City of Boston Trust Funds held international equity mutual
funds valued at $102.3 million. Although these investments are not denominated in a foreign currency, the
underlying securities are denominated in various foreign currencies.

g. Fair Value Hierarchy
Investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Recurring fair value measurements are
those that GASB statements require or permit in the Statement of Net Position or Balance Sheet at the
end of each reporting period. Fair value measurements are categorized based on the valuation inputs
used to measure an asset's fair value: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical

43 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date; Level 2
inputs are other than quoted prices in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, or similar assets
or liabilities either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data; Level 3 inputs
are significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant
to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value.
Money market funds: Valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. Money market funds held
by the Pool of the money market fund and the City are open-end money market funds that are registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The money market funds held by the City and classified as
Level 1 are deemed to be actively traded.
Institutional and mutual funds: Valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. Institutional and
mutual funds held by the City are open-end funds that are registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The institutional and mutual funds held by the Pool and classified as Level 1 are deemed to
be actively traded. If market quotations are not readily available, the funds are valued by the pricing method
determined by investment managers which determines valuations using methods based upon market
transactions for comparable securities.
Equity securities: Consist primarily of corporate stocks traded on U.S. and non-U.S. active security
exchanges. Stocks traded on active exchanges and valued at quoted market prices and documented
trade history for identical assets are categorized within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. If market
quotations are not readily available, the stocks may be valued using pricing models maximizing the use of
observable inputs for similar securities and are classified as Level 2.
US. Treasury and agency securities: Securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, authorities and
instrumentalities are valued using quoted prices, documented trade history in the security, and pricing
models maximizing the use of observable inputs determined by investment managers.
Corporate debt instruments: Valued either by using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs
for similar securities or valued by the investment manager.
The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net
realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the City believes its valuation
methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies
or assumptions to determine if the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair
value measurement at the reporting date. The City of Boston Trust Funds have the following recurring fair
value measurements as of June 30, 2018 (in thousands):

Boston Retirement System
a. Custodial Credit Risk
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of bank failure, the System’s deposits may not be returned.
The System carries deposits that are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
insurance or collateralized with securities held by the System or the System’s agent in the System’s name.
As of December 31, 2017, all of the System’s deposits were insured or collateralized.
b. Investment Policy
The provisions of M.G.L. C. 32, Sec 23(2); 840 C.M.R. 16-19, 21, 23, 26; and, the Plan’s own investment
regulations (stated at http://www.mass.gov/perac/board-info/profiles/investment/bostonintsup.html)
govern the System’s investment practice. Diversification is attained through varied investment management
styles that comply with Massachusetts state law. This is accomplished through the retention of investment
managers that adhere to M.G.L. C. 32, Sec. 3(3), the “Prudent Person” rule.
The System has retained an investment consultant to work with The Boston Retirement Board in a fiduciary
capacity to assure that strategic investment diversification is attained, to employ investment managers with
expertise in their respective asset classes, and to closely monitor the implementation and performance of
the respective investment strategies.
The System is currently invested in stocks (domestic and foreign), fixed income securities (domestic and
foreign), real estate, private equity, PRIT and hedge funds.
c. Interest Rate Risk
The following is a listing of the System’s fixed income investments (in thousands) and related maturity

The System’s guidelines do not specifically address limits on maturities as a means of managing its exposure
to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. The managers of each fixed income portfolio is
responsible for determining the maturity and commensurate returns of their portfolio.
The collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) held by the System as of December 31, 2017 are highly
sensitive to changes in interest rates.
d.

Credit Risk

The System allows investment managers to apply discretion under the “Prudent Person” rule. Investments
are made, as a prudent person would be expected to act with discretion and intelligence, to seek reasonable
income, preserve capital, and, in general, avoid speculative investments.
The System’s fixed income investments as of December 31, 2017 were rated by S & P and/or an equivalent
national rating organization and the ratings are presented below (in thousands) using the S & P rating scale:

In addition to the above schedule, the System has approximately $189.4 million invested in U.S. government
securities, which are not rated as they are explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government.
e. Concentration Risk
Other than the Pension Reserves Investment Trust (PRIT) fund, The System has no investments, at fair value,
except for pooled funds, that exceed 5% of the System’s total investments as of December 31, 2017.
The System adheres to the provisions of M.G.L. c. 32, sec. 23(2); 840 C.M.R. 16-19, 21, 23, 26; and the Plan’s
own investment regulations when managing concentration risk.

Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of an
investment or a deposit. Similar to the investments in domestic equities, the System employs or encourages
its investment advisor to employ diversification, asset allocation, and quality strategies.
Risk of loss arises from changes in currency exchange rates. The System’s exposure to foreign currency risk

47 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

g. PRIT External Investment Pooled Fund
The Massachusetts legislature enacted Section 17 of Chapter 112 of the Acts of 2010 that requires the
System to invest all assets, current and future, related to Boston Teachers in the PRIT fund. The PRIT pooled
fund is an external investment pool that is not registered with the Securities Exchange Commission, but is
subject to oversight provided by the Pension Reserves Investment Management Board (the PRIM Board).
The PRIM Board was created by legislation to provide general supervision of the investments and
management of PRIT. PRIT is not a rated fund.
The fair value of the PRIT pooled fund is based on unit value as reported by management of the PRIT pooled
fund. The PRIT pooled fund issues separately available audited financial statements with a year-end of June
30.
On July 1, 2010, the System transferred 27% of its assets, or $1.1 billion, to the PRIT pooled fund. As of
December 31, 2017, the System had the following amounts invested in the PRIT fund (in thousands):

Total PRIT pooled funds

$

1,704,202

h. Derivatives
The System trades financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of its investing
activities to assist in managing exposure to market risks. The System uses forward foreign currency contracts
to hedge against the risk of future foreign currency fluctuations. As of December 31, 2017, the System had
24 forward foreign currency contracts with a net notional amount of $6,077,144 and fair value of $(19,305).
i.

Securities Lending
The Public Employment Retirement Administration Commission of Massachusetts (PERAC) has issued
supplemental regulations that permit the System to engage in securities lending transactions. Securities
lending is an investment management enhancement that utilizes certain existing securities of the Plan to
earn additional income. These transactions are conducted by the System’s custodian, which lends certain
securities owned by the System to other broker dealers and banks pursuant to a form of loan agreement.
The System and the borrowers maintain the right to terminate all securities lending transactions on demand.
Securities lending involves the loaning of securities to approved banks and broker-dealers. In return for the
loaned securities, the custodian, prior to or simultaneous with delivery of the loaned securities to the
borrower, receives collateral in the form of cash (including both U.S. and foreign currency) or U.S.
government securities, sovereign debt of foreign countries, and irrevocable bank letters of credit as
collateral to serve as a safeguard against possible default of any borrower on the return of the loan. The
custodian does not have the ability to pledge or sell collateral unless the borrower defaults. Borrowers are
required to deliver collateral in the amounts equal to not less than 100% of the market value of the loaned
securities. The collateral is marked to market on a daily basis. In the event the counterparty is unable to
meet its contractual obligation under the securities lending arrangement, the Plan may incur losses equal
to the amount by which the market value of the securities differs from the amount of collateral held. The
Plan mitigates credit risk associated with securities lending arrangements by monitoring the fair value of
the securities loaned on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as necessary. At
December 31, 2017, the System had no credit risk exposure to borrowers because the amounts the System
owed the borrowers exceeded the amounts owed to the System.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • 48

The System does not impose any restrictions on the amount of securities lent on its behalf by the custodian.
There were no failures by any borrowers to return loaned securities or pay distributions thereon and there
were no losses from a default of the borrowers or the custodian for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The cash collateral received by the custodian on each loan was invested, together with the cash collateral
of other qualified tax-exempt plan lenders, in a collective investment pool. The relationship between the
average maturities of the investment pool and loans was affected by the maturities of the loans made by
other plans that invested cash collateral in the collective investment pool, which the System could not
determine.
The Plan maintains full ownership rights to the securities loaned and, accordingly, classifies loaned securities
as investments. At December 31, 2017, the fair value of securities loaned by the System amounted to
$291.3 million, against which was held collateral of $306.4 million as follows (in thousands):

Fixed income and equity securities classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are valued using prices quoted in active
markets for those securities. Fixed income securities classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued using a matrix
pricing technique. Matrix pricing is used to value securities based on the securities’ relationship to benchmark quoted
prices.
The PRIT pooled fund is an external investment pool that is not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
but is subject to oversight provided by the Pension Reserves Investment Management Board (the PRIM Board). The PRIM
Board was created by legislation to provide general supervision of the investments and management of PRIT. PRIT is not a
rated fund. The fair value of the PRIT pooled fund is based on unit value as reported by management of the PRIT pooled
fund. The PRIT fund issues separately available audited financial statements with a year-end of June 30. The Plan is required
to provide a 30-day redemption notice for this investment.

1.

Global Multi-strategy Hedge Fund of Funds. This type includes investments in 5 hedge funds that invest in other hedge
fund managers. Management of each hedge fund is given full discretion to invest with direct hedge fund managers.
The fair value of the investments in this type has been determined using the NAV per share of the investments.

2.

Real Estate Funds. This type includes 29 real estate funds that invest primarily in U.S. commercial real estate. The fair
values of the investments in this type have been determined using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) of the System’s
ownership interest in partners’ capital. Distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying investments
of the funds are liquidated. It is expected that the underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated over the next 7
to 10 years.

3.

Private Equity Funds. This type includes 60 private equity funds that invest primarily in U.S. companies. These
investments can never be redeemed with the funds; instead, the nature of the investments in this type is that
distributions are received through the liquidation of the underlying assets of the funds. It is expected that the
underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated over the next 7 to 10 years.

6. Property Taxes
Real and personal property taxes are based on values assessed as of each January 1. By law, all taxable property
must be assessed at 100% of fair cash value. Also by law, property taxes must be levied at least 30 days prior
to their due date. Once levied, these taxes are recorded as receivables, net of estimated uncollectible balances.
Property tax revenues have been recorded using the accrual and modified accrual basis of accounting as
described in note 2.
The City bills and collects its property taxes on a quarterly basis following the January 1 assessment. The due
dates for those quarterly tax billings are August 1, November 1, February 1, and May 1. Property taxes that
remain unpaid after the respective due dates are subject to penalties and interest charges.

51 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Based on the City’s experience, most property taxes are collected during the year in which they are assessed.
Liening of properties on which taxes remain unpaid occurs annually. On December 19, 2017, all properties with
unpaid fiscal year 2017 property taxes were liened. The City ultimately has the right to foreclose on all properties
where the taxes remain unpaid.
A statewide property tax limitation known as “Proposition 2 1/2” limits the amount of increase in the property
tax levy in any fiscal year. Generally, Proposition 2 1/2 limits the total levy to an amount not greater than
2 1/2% of the total assessed value of all taxable property within the City. Secondly, the tax levy cannot increase
by more than 2 1/2% of the prior year’s levy plus the taxes on property newly added to the tax rolls. Certain
provisions of Proposition 2 1/2 can be overridden by a citywide referendum.

a. Long Term Receivable
The City participates in the Commonwealth’s school building assistance program, which is administered by
the MSBA. The MSBA provides financial assistance (up to 80% of total costs) to the City to build and/or
renovate schools. As of June 30, 2018, under this program, the City was due funds totaling $11.8 million.
In the General Fund, the receivable is offset by deferred inflows of resources because the revenue is not
considered available. The following is a schedule of the three year paydown (in thousands) as of June 30,
2019 through 2020:

Notes Receivable
Section 108 is the loan guarantee provision of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.
Section 108 provides communities with a source of financing for economic development, housing
rehabilitation, public facilities, and large scale physical development projects. Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) provides grants or loans to local governments, which in turn provides loans to
developers. As of June 30, 2018, under this program, the City determined that $29 million was collectible.
This amount is recorded in the City’s Special Revenue fund.

b. Tax Abatement Programs
The City enters into tax abatement agreements that meet the reporting requirements of GASB Statement No. 77
"Tax Abatement Disclosures". Below are descriptions of the tax abatement programs and the amount of real
estate taxes that were abated for each program during the fiscal year.
Chapter 121A
Chapter 121A of the Massachusetts General Laws authorizes a local government in cooperation with its
redevelopment authorities to suspend the imposition of real and personal property taxes, betterments and
special assessments on properties determined to be “blighted” in order to encourage the redevelopment of
residential, commercial, civic, recreational, historic or industrial projects by Chapter 121A Corporations. The City
receives two principal sources of revenue from Chapter 121A Corporations. The first consists of an excise, as
determined under Section 10 of Chapter 121A, that each Chapter 121A Corporation must pay to the
Commonwealth that is then distributed to the City. The second form of revenue consists of payments as required
by a contract between the City and Chapter 121A Corporations as authorized by Chapter 121A, Section 6A that
provide for additional revenue beyond the excise provided under Section 10 of Chapter 121A.
Chapter 121B
Chapter 121B of the Massachusetts General Laws authorizes a local government, at their option and through
their redevelopment authorities, to undertake public actions to address substandard or blighted open areas for
residential, commercial, industrial, business, government, recreational, educational, hospital or other uses.
Chapter 121B project owners may be exempted from property taxes. In these cases, an agreement to make
annual in lieu of tax payments to the City is required.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF)
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) is a property tax incentive authorized under the Economic Development Incentive
Program pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 40, Section 59 and administered by the
Commonwealth’s Economic Assistance Coordinating Council. In return for substantial job creation, a local
government may provide businesses with tax relief on the incremental growth in their property's value for up to
20 years. In Boston, TIF projects must be approved by the Mayor and City Council.
The following are estimated taxes abated for the year ended June 30, 2018 by tax abatement program (in

On May 30, 2018, the City issued $150.0 million of general obligation bonds for various municipal capital
projects. Interest on the bonds are payable semiannually each May 1 and November 1 until maturity in
fiscal year 2038.
The City has entered into various capital lease agreements for equipment acquisition. Payments under
these agreements are subject to annual appropriation and, by statute, are not included in the City’s debt
limit calculations. The gross amount of assets acquired under the equipment lease agreements totals $69.6
million as of June 30, 2018. The City’s operating lease with DSRC is described in note 19.
No Obligation Debt
The City has outstanding industrial, commercial, and housing development bonds payable solely from
revenues of the respective enterprises that do not constitute an indebtedness of the City and are not
charged against its general credit. This aggregate amount is immaterial to the financial statements.

57 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Defeased Debt
The principal amount of debt refunded through in substance defeasance transactions for governmental
activities and still outstanding at June 30, 2018 was approximately $57.6 million.
Debt Capacity
The City is subject to a dual general debt limit: the normal debt limit and the double debt limit. Such limits
are equal to 5% and 10%, respectively, of the valuation of taxable property in the City as last equalized by
the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. Debt may be authorized up to the normal debt limit without
state approval. Authorizations under the double debt limit, however, require the approval of the
Commonwealth’s Secretary of Administration and Finance. Additionally, there are many categories of
general obligation debt, which are exempt from the debt limit but are subject to other limitations.
As of June 30, 2018, the City may issue $5.03 billion of additional general obligation debt under the debt
limit. General obligation debt of $896.9 million, subject to the debt limit, and $76.6 million, exempt from
the debt limit, are authorized but unissued as of June 30, 2018.
11. Retirement Plans
a. Plan Description
The City contributes to the BRS, a cost-sharing, multiple-employer qualified defined benefit governmental
pension plan. The System provides retirement, disability, and death benefits to plan members and
beneficiaries of the following government units:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)

City of Boston
Boston Planning & Development Agency
Boston Housing Authority
Boston Water and Sewer Commission
Boston Public Health Commission
Sheriff of Suffolk County (Retirees as of December 31, 2009, funded by the City)

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts also is another contributing entity and makes contributions to BRS
related to City of Boston teachers.
The System is administered by a five person Board of Retirement consisting of the City Auditor, who serves
as a member ex officio, two members who are elected by the participants, in or retired from the service of
the System, a fourth member appointed by the Mayor, and a fifth member chosen by the other members.
A complete set of financial statements for BRS for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 can be obtained
through the BRS, Boston City Hall, Room 816, Boston, MA 02201 or by accessing the website
www.cityofboston.gov/retirement/investment.asp.
Participation in the System is mandatory for all permanent, full time, and certain part-time employees
immediately upon the commencement of employment. Participants who resign from employment, or are
receiving workers’ compensation benefits, and who are not eligible to receive a retirement allowance are
entitled to request a refund of their accumulated total deductions. In addition, those participants who
resign voluntarily with less than ten years of service are entitled to receive 3% per year interest; all others
receive interest which has accrued on their cumulative deductions at the regular interest rate (0.1% at
December 31, 2017).

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • 58

Employees with ten or more years of service having attained age 55 are entitled to pension benefits; an
earlier retirement is allowed upon completion of 20 years of service. The System provides for retirement
allowance benefits up to a maximum of 80% of a participant’s highest consecutive three-year average annual
rate of regular compensation (highest consecutive five-year average for those members who join the System
on or after April 2, 2012). Benefit payments are based upon a participant’s age, length of creditable service,
regular compensation, and group classification. Participants become vested after ten years of creditable
service. Effective July 1, 1998 Chapter 32 of the M.G.L. assigned the authority to establish and amend
benefit provisions and grant cost-of-living increases for the plan to the Boston Retirement Board.
If a member in service dies due to causes unrelated to his or her job, the surviving spouse and/or surviving
dependent children may receive benefits, either in a lump sum or in the form of an annuity based on the
length of service, contributions and age. In the event there are no spouse and/or dependent children named,
other beneficiaries may be entitled to a lump-sum distribution. Participants who become permanently and
totally disabled from further duty may be eligible to receive accidental or ordinary disability retirement
benefits.
Accidental disability is provided to members with incapacitation resulting from a work-related injury or
hazard. Generally, annual pension benefits are provided based on 72% of the annual rate of regular
compensation a member earned while an active employee on date of injury or average annual rate of
regular compensation. Ordinary disability is available to any member whose permanent incapacitation is
not work-related and has attained ten years of creditable service. Such benefits are provided as if the
member had attained the age of 55 (or actual age if over 55) based on the amount of creditable service
actually earned. Limits are placed on how much a disability employee can earn from other sources while
collecting a disability retirement pension.
The City is legally responsible for funding the employer portion of all pensions associated with certain
retirees from the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD), which became part of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts in 2010, pursuant to a cooperation agreement (the Agreement) dated June 28, 2011.
According to the Agreement, all employees of the SCSD, or its predecessor department, who retired prior
to January 1, 2010 remained retirees of the BRS. In addition, members of AFSCME Local 419 who retired
between January 1, 2010 and October 31, 2010, remained retirees of the BRS. Employer contributions
related to these retirees are the responsibility of the City under the Agreement.
Special Funding Situations
The City is party to a special funding situation with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with respect to
City of Boston Teachers. The Commonwealth is responsible for funding the employer portion of all teacher
pensions in the Commonwealth. All teachers in the Commonwealth are members of the Massachusetts
Teachers Retirement System, with the exception of teachers employed by the City, who are members of
BRS. Although Boston Teachers are members of BRS, the Commonwealth is the responsible contributing
entity as described in Chapter 112 of the Massachusetts General Laws Acts of 2010.
The Commonwealth is also legally responsible for reimbursing BRS for a portion of the benefits payments
for cost of living increases granted before July 1997 as described in Chapter 112 of the Massachusetts
General Laws Acts of 2010.

59 • City of Boston Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

b. BRS Basis of Accounting
The System’s financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Plan member
contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are due. Employer contributions are
recognized as additions in the period when they become due pursuant to formal statutory obligations.
Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms of the plan.
Investments are reported at fair value. The following is a description of the valuation techniques and inputs
used for each major class of assets and liabilities measured at fair value:
(1) Short-term, Equity and Fixed Income Investments - Securities traded on a national or international
exchange are valued at the last reported sales price at current exchange rates. Certain fixed income securities
not traded on an exchange are valued using a matrix pricing technique. Matrix pricing is used to value
securities based on the securities' relationship to benchmark quoted prices.
(2) Pooled funds - the fair value of shares in managed investment pools is based on unit values reported
by the funds.
(3) Alternative investments include hedge funds, holding through commingled limited partnerships of
venture capital funds, including equity interests in early, middle, and later stage companies, as well as debt
and equity interests in buyouts, acquisitions, restructurings, mezzanine structures and special situations,
such as litigation or spin-off activities. These investments are carried at the limited partnership interest or
redemption value, the equivalent of net asset value, which approximates fair value. Values assigned to
such investments are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that may
ultimately be realized in liquidation. Liquidation values depend largely on future circumstances, including
marketability, and frequently cannot reasonably be estimated until at, or near, the liquidation date.
(4) Real estate investments consist of interests in commercial properties held by various partnerships and
other limited liability entities, some of which utilize debt financing. Fair values of such holdings are reported
based on the net asset values of the entities, which are estimated using third-party appraisals and other
information provided by property managers.
c. Membership
Membership in the System consisted of the following at December 31, 2015:
Active plan members

20,498

Retirees and beneficiaries receiving benefits

14,485

Inactive members entitled to a return of contributions

8,690

Inactive members entitled to, but not yet receiving benefits

1,050

d. Contributions
Plan members are required to contribute to the System. Depending on their employment date, active members
must contribute a range of 5% – 11% of their regular gross compensation. Non-teacher members hired after January
1, 1979 must contribute an additional 2% of regular compensation in excess of $30,000. Participating employers
are required to pay into the System their share of the remaining System-wide actuarially determined contribution,
which is apportioned among the employers based on an actuarial computation. The contributions of plan members
and the participating employers are governed by Chapter 32 of the M.G.L. For the year ended December 31, 2017,
the System was due $391.5 million from all employers and the Commonwealth and received $391.5 million in these
contributions. For the year ended June 30, 2018, inclusive of contributions related to SCSD, and exclusive of
contributions related to the City’s teachers, the City’s required and actual contribution was $214.2 million. For the
year ended June 30, 2018, the Commonwealth’s required and actual contribution related to City Teachers was

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • 60

$131.3 million. The amount is reported as intergovernmental revenue and retirement cost expenditures in the
General Fund.

City Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources Related to Pensions
At June 30, 2018, the City reported a liability of $1.29 billion for its proportionate share of the BRS net
pension liability measured as of December 31, 2017. This net pension liability includes amounts related to
SCSD retirees and reflects a reduction for the special funding situations with the Commonwealth. The
amount recognized by the City as its proportionate share of the net pension liability, the proportionate
share related to the Commonwealth special funding situations, and the total portion of the net pension
liability associated with the City measured at December 31, 2017 were as follows (in thousands):

To determine employers' proportionate share of the net pension liability, separate calculations of net
pension liability were performed for each of the Commonwealth special funding situations, SCSD retirees,
and the remaining non-teacher group. At December 31, 2017, the City was allocated 100% of the net
pension liability for SCSD retirees and 82.1% of the remaining non-teacher group based on its proportion
of 2015 required employer contributions related to this group. The City’s proportion of the collective BRS
net pension liability at December 31, 2017 was 32.04% compared to 35.66% at December 31, 2016.
For the year ended June 30, 2018, in the Government-wide financial statements, the City recognized pension
expense of $444.3 million and revenue of $248.7 million related to the Commonwealth special funding
situations. At June 30, 2016, the City reported deferred outflows of resources related to pensions from the
following sources (in thousands):

For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows
of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the
BRS and additions to/deductions from the BRS’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same
basis as they are reported for the BRS.
g. Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability for the December 31, 2017 measurement date was determined by using an
actuarial valuation as of December 31, 2015, with updated procedures used to roll forward the total pension
liability to December 31, 2017. The measurement of the total pension liability at December 31, 2017 applied
the following actuarial assumptions:
Inflation
Salary Scale
Investment rate of return,
including inflation
Cost of living adjustments
Mortality

3.25%
7.5% to 4% percent, indexed by year of service, for teachers
and 4.5% to 4% for non-teachers
7.50% for BRS excluding teachers and 7.35% for teachers,
net of expenses, including inflation
3% of first $14,000 ($13,000 at December 31, 2016)
RP-2014 Blue Collar Employee and Healthy Annuitant Mortality Tables set forward 1 year
for female participants projected generationally using Scale MP-2017 for BRS excluding
Teachers and RP-2014 White Collar Employee and Healthy Annuitant Mortality Tables
projected generationally with Scale MP-2016 for Teachers

The investment rate of return of 7.5% for non-teachers and 7.35% for teachers, indicated above, was a
reduction from the 7.75% and 7.5%, respectively, used in the measurement of the December 31, 2016
liability.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • 62

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block
method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of
pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are
combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of
return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation.
Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the target asset
allocation as of the actuarial valuation date of December 31, 2017 for BRS, excluding Teachers, are
summarized below:

h. Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.50% for BRS excluding Teachers. The
projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumes that contributions from plan members
will be made at the current contribution rate and that contributions of participating employers and the
Commonwealth will be made at rates equal to the actuarially determined contribution rates. Based on
those assumptions, the BRS's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected
future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on
pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total
pension liability.

Non-contributory retirees and beneficiaries
In addition to appropriation payments to cover current and future benefit payments of City employees covered
by the BRS, the City funds noncontributory retirement benefits for pensioners whose employment predates the
BRS, certain veterans who meet certain state law requirements, former employees retired under Massachusetts
Special Acts and families receiving killed-in-the-line-of-duty benefits. These retirees and beneficiaries receive
benefits for their lifetime. As of June 30, 2018, the date of the City’s Actuarial Valuation for the City’s Noncontributory and Special Legislation Retirees, the City is providing such benefits to 71 pensioners; these benefits
are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis with annual benefits of approximately $4.0 million. The City’s net pension
liability for the noncontributory retirees and beneficiaries is $85.9 million, as of June 30, 2018.
The actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2016 was used to determine the City’s pension liability and pension

The pension expense reflects immediate recognition of the change in assumptions because the group of retirees
and beneficiaries is assumed to be closed.
There are no deferred outflows/inflows of resources related to these pensions. The discount rate used to
determine the total pension liability was 3.87% as of June 30, 2018 and 3.58% as of June 30, 2017, which was the
high quality tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rates (20-Bond GO Index) as published by The Bond
Buyer for those dates. The mortality assumptions are the same as used in the Boston Retirement System
Actuarial Valuation Report as noted in footnote 11(g).

12. Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB)
Plan Description
The City sponsors and participates in the Other Postemployment Benefit Trust Plan (the Plan) an agent
multi-employer defined benefit OPEB plan that provides healthcare and insurance benefits, in accordance
with state statute and City ordinance, to participating retirees and their beneficiaries. The Boston Public
Health Commission, a discretely presented component unit, also participates and contributes to the plan.
City ordinance grants the authority to the City to establish a healthcare benefit trust fund for purposes of
providing retiree healthcare benefits to employees of the City and the Boston Public Health Commission.
The OPEB plan is administered by the City and issues a standalone financial report that can be obtained
from www.boston.gov/departments/auditing
a. Benefits Provided
Medical and prescription drug benefits are provided to all eligible retirees not enrolled in Medicare through
a variety of plans offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, and
Neighborhood Health Plan. Medical and prescription drug benefits are provided to retirees enrolled in
Medicare through supplemental and Medicare Advantage plans offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, and Tufts Health Plan.
Groups 1 and 2 retirees, including teachers, with at least 10 years or 20 years of creditable service are
eligible at age 55 or any age, respectively. Group 4 retirees with at least 10 years or 20 years of creditable
service are eligible at age 45 or any age, respectively. Retirees on accidental disability retirement are eligible
at any age, while ordinary disability requires 10 years of creditable service. The surviving spouse is eligible
to receive pre and post retirement death benefits, as well as medical and prescription drug coverage.
b. Employees Covered by the Benefit Terms

c. Contributions
Employer and employee contribution rates are governed by the respective collective bargaining
agreements. The OPEB Plan is currently funded on a pay-as-you-go basis plus periodic advance funding
contributions as amounts are available. The employers and plan members share the cost of benefits. As of
June 30, 2017, the valuation date, the plan members contribute 12.0% to 29.5% of the monthly premium
cost, depending on the plan in which they are enrolled. The City contributes the balance of the premium
cost.
d. Basis of Accounting
The OPEB Trust Fund Financial Statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Employer
contributions to the plan are recognized when made. Benefits are recognized when due and payable in
accordance with the terms of each plan.
Investments are reported at fair value. Fair value of securities held directly are based on quotations from
national securities exchanges.
e. Investment Policy
The provisions of Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L) c. 44 sec 54 allows investment in securities listed
on the Commonwealth’s approved securities listing. The OPEB investment portfolio is managed by the City’s
Investment committee consisting of the City Auditor, the Assistant City Manager of Fiscal
Affairs, Assistant Finance Director, and City Assessor. The investment strategy is to reduce risk through the
prudent diversification of the portfolio across the distinct allowable asset classes. The Committee aims to
remain consistent in the approach and refrain from dramatically shifting asset class allocation over a short
period.
Actuarial Methods and Assumptions
The total OPEB liability at June 30, 2018 was based on a June 30, 2017 valuation using the following
assumptions:
Salary Increase. Non-teachers: 4.0 to 4.5%. Teachers: 4.0 to 7.5%
Inflation Increase. 3.25%
Actuarial Cost Method. The entry age normal cost method based on level percentage of payroll.
Mortality. RP-2014 generational table using Scale MP-2017 for non-teachers and MP-2016 for teachers,
applied on a gender-specific basis.
Healthcare cost trend rates. Trend rates begin with 7.0% and decrease 0.5% annually to an ultimate rate of
5.0% for non-medicare costs and 8.0%, decreasing by 0.5% annually to an ultimate rate of 5.0%.
Discount Rate. The discount rate used to measure the total OPEB liability is 6.75% per annum.
The long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was determined using a building-block
method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of
OPEB plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are
combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of
return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. The target allocation and

$262 thousand in Other Governmental Funds.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • 71

Infrastructure Investment Incentive Transactions
Infrastructure Investment Incentive transactions (I-Cubed) are governed by Chapter 293 of the Acts of 2006
(the Act). Under the Act, the funding for the projects associated with these transactions is provided through
proceeds of bonds issued by the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency (MDFA) and is to be used for
approved public infrastructure improvements undertaken by the developer. The debt service on these bonds
will be paid by the Commonwealth through State Infrastructure Development Assistance to the extent that
New State Tax Revenues generated once the project is operational offset the amounts paid to MDFA to cover
the debt service. When this is not the case, the participating municipality or developer generally will be
responsible for the shortfall depending on the transaction agreement. The Act provides for the establishment
of a Municipal Liquidity Reserve (MLR) from which the participating municipality can draw to offset any required
payments made to the Commonwealth. The MLR is generally funded by the developer either through cash or
a direct pay letter of credit.
During fiscal year 2015 , the City executed two Infrastructure Development Assistance Agreements (IDAA) for
I-Cubed transactions. Under the first IDAA, $32.4 million in bonds were issued by MDFA in September 2015.
Also, an MLR of $1.2 million was established at the time of the issuance of the bonds. This reserve is equal to
twice the maximum annual debt service payable in any fiscal year on the bonds issued under the indenture.
The City is obligated for any shortfalls between debt service on the bonds and New State Tax Revenues. However,
it has the right to assess the developer or draw from the MLR for any payments on such obligations. The City
had no obligation for any shortfalls at June 30, 2018. The City also recorded $11.2 million in donated capital
assets in fiscal year 2016 for improvements to City-owned infrastructure made by the developer. These assets
have been recorded at acquisition value which has been defined as "the price that would be paid to acquire an
asset with equivalent service potential in an orderly market transaction at the acquisition date."
Under the second IDAA, $10.0 million in bonds were issued by MDFA in fiscal year 2016. The City is obligated
for any shortfalls between debt service on the bonds and New State Tax Revenues. However, it has the right
to assess the developer or draw from the MLR for one-third of any payments on such obligations. The City had
no obligation for any shortfalls at June 30, 2018.
In connection with this second I-Cubed transaction, the City has a leasehold interest in a portion of the parking
garage, which represents the public infrastructure improvements under the transaction, created under a master
lease and its assignments and a sublease. With the execution of the master lease and sublease agreements,
along with the assignment agreements transferring the interests of the owner of the parking garage to the City
through the BPDA, the City essentially becomes the lessee on the master lease and the sub-landlord on the
sublease. This results in the City having no responsibility for the operation of the parking garage and having
the right to collect from the sub-lessee Section 121A PILOT payments from 2015 through 2036 and then base
rent from 2036 through 2055, both of which are largely based on a percentage of gross revenues of the parking
garage. The City has no obligation for any payments as lessee under the master lease.
17. Public Health System
Effective July 1, 1996, the City’s Department of Health and Hospitals and Trustees of Health and Hospitals were
abolished. Substantially all their assets and liabilities, including title to the City’s two hospitals, BCH and Boston
Specialty and Rehabilitation Hospital (BSRH), were transferred to and assumed by BPHC.

Notes to Basic Financial Statements • 72

Also effective July 1, 1996, the operations of BCH and BSRH were consolidated with the operations of the Boston
University Medical Center under the licensure and control of the BMC.
The BPHC receives the majority of its funding from federal and state grants, and a City appropriation. During
fiscal year 2018, the City appropriated $79.6 million to the BPHC. As described below, the BPHC uses the
appropriation to pay debt service on certain general obligation bonds, for administrative purposes and to
support the various public health programs run by the BPHC. The City has budgeted $85.6 million for the BPHC
for fiscal year 2019.
Due from BPHC/BMC
The BPHC is also responsible for reimbursing the City for health insurance, equipment lease payments, workers’
compensation, and other miscellaneous expenses paid for by the City.
18. Risk Management
The Risk Management Program focuses on a planned strategy of self-insurance, supported by strong prevention
and cost reduction efforts, financial reserves and catastrophic insurance. The City is self-insured in most areas
of risk including general liability, property and casualty, workers’ compensation, certain employee health care
costs and unemployment compensation.
The City’s legal liabilities are capped per M.G.L. Chapter 258, and Corporation Counsel defends the City in any
lawsuits that arise from the normal course of operations. For workers’ compensation, the City is exempt from
state insurance requirements per M.G.L. Chapter 152 Section 25B. The City’s Workers’ Compensation Division
as well as the Police and Fire Departments manage employee injury claims internally. The City budgets for and
funds legal claims and employee injury costs through the General Fund, charging specific departments for their
share of costs in order to promote awareness and prevention efforts.
The City provides health insurance coverage for employees and retirees through a variety of self-insured plans.
The City budgets for and funds the premium costs for all plans through the General Fund. Self-insured plans
are financially managed through the Internal Service Fund established in compliance with M.G.L. Chapter 32B,
Section 3A. The guiding policy for the City of Boston Health Claims Trust Fund states that accounting for the
fund will be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and will ensure that all contributions
and actual costs are shared between employers and their subscribers according to predetermined ratios.
For unexpected large losses, the City maintains a catastrophic risk reserve, which has an available balance of
$34.8 million at the end of fiscal 2018. To further protect the City’s assets and finances from adverse loss,
commercial insurance is purchased strategically for certain exposures. A catastrophic property insurance policy
provides $100.0 million for all risk protection after a $10.0 million deductible. Boiler and machinery losses are
insured up to $25.0 million per incident, after a $50 thousand deductible.
The City has established a liability based on historical trends of previous years and attorneys’ estimates of
pending matters and lawsuits in which the City is involved. Changes in the self-insurance liability for the fiscal
years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows (in thousands):

There are numerous pending matters and lawsuits in which the City is involved. The City attorneys’ estimate
that the potential claims against the City not recorded in the accompanying basic financial statements resulting
from such litigation would not materially affect the basic financial statements.
19. Dudley Square Realty Corporation (DSRC) and Ferdinand Building Development Corporation (FBDC)
As described in note 1, the DSRC is a Qualified Active Low-Income Community Business, and is the owner and
developer of the Dudley Municipal Center property. FBDC is the leverage lender of the Dudley Municipal Center
property. As the project sponsor during fiscal year 2013, the City authorized and issued $28.9 million in general
obligation bonds and transferred proceeds to FBDC. FBDC, utilizing these bond proceeds, made loans totaling
$29.3 million to two investment funds. As of June 30, 2018, $29.3 million is due to FBDC on such loans. The
investment funds made these proceeds and funds from additional investments available to eight leverage
lenders that made loans in the aggregate amount of $40.8 million to DSRC to finance the Dudley Municipal
Center project. This amount is recorded in the City’s Notes and Leases Payable line of note 10. With the
completion of the Dudley Municipal Center project, FBDC is the master tenant and leases the project from
DSRC.
FBDC subleases the majority of space of the project to the City. The schedule of payments is the same in the
lease and the sublease as follows (in thousands):

Other Governmental Funds

Prudential Center

Other Governmental Funds are those funds that are not defined as major funds.
Permanent Fund, established by GASB Statement No. 34, is used to report resources that are legally restricted to the
extent that only earnings, and not principal, may be used for purposes that support the reporting government’s programs,
that is, for the benefit of the government or its citizenry. The permanent fund is composed of the following pools:
Pool#1 is used for the maintenance and improvement of the City’s parks and cemeteries and the erection and maintenance
of statues and monuments for the use and enjoyment of City residents.
Pool#2 is used for scholarship awards, the purchase of educational equipment, and the aid of needy students.
Pool#7 is a co-mingled investment fund of various non-testamentary trust funds of the City of Boston. The non-expendable
portion of the fund is composed of donations/contributions from either individuals or organizations. Donations/
contributions are to be expended in conformity with their respective trust instruments.
Debt Service Fund is used to account for resources accumulating for principal and interest for the 2009 Qualified
Construction School Bond.
Dudley Square Realty Corporation (DSRC) and Ferdinand Building Development Corporation (FBDC)– The DSRC and FBDC
are non-profit organizations qualified as tax-exempt entities under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Although legally separate, both DSRC and FBDC provide services entirely, or almost entirely, to the City and thus have
been reported as blended component units. DSRC and FBDC are used to account for the construction and financing of
the Dudley Municipal Center.

Fiduciary Funds

Leonard P. Zakim Bridge

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLAN
Boston Retirement System is a defined benefit contributory retirement plan covering employees of the City of Boston,
Boston Public Health Commission, Boston Housing Authority, Boston Redevelopment Authority, and the Boston Water
and Sewer Commission. The System is subject to benefit provisions and financing requirements set forth primarily in
Chapter 32 of the Massachusetts General Laws.
OPEB TRUST FUND
The OPEB Trust Fund is an irrevocable trust fund established for other postemployment benefits. The assets are
appropriated from the General Fund and accumulate to reduce the unfunded actuarial liability for health care and other
postemployment benefits.
PRIVATE PURPOSE TRUST FUNDS
Private purpose trust funds are used to report any trust arrangement not otherwise classified as pension or benefit trusts,
or an investment trust fund, “under which principal and income benefit individuals, private organizations, or other
governments.”
Pool#1 is a co-mingled investment fund of various trust funds of the City. A number of the Pool#1 trust funds are for the
maintenance and improvement of the City’s parks and cemeteries for the use and enjoyment of City residents. The other
portion of Pool#1 trust funds lack a general government purpose and are therefore classified here as private purpose
trust funds.
Pool#2 is used for scholarship awards, the purchase of educational equipment, and the aid of needy students.
Pool#5 is formed by the will of George R. White dated May 21, 1920. The will requires that the fund’s income be used
for the creation of public utility and beauty for the use and enjoyment of the inhabitants of the City.
Pool#7 is a co-mingled investment fund of various non-testamentary trust funds of the City of Boston. The nonexpendable
portion of the fund is composed of donations/contributions from either individuals or organizations. Donations/
contributions are to be expended in conformity with their respective trust instruments.
AGENCY FUND
Law Enforcement Trust Fund accounts for proceeds from property seized from illegal drug-related activities. Funds can
be used to defray the costs of protracted investigations, to provide technical equipment or expertise, and to provide
matching funds for federal grants.

Note: For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 the City implemented GASB Statement No. 54, “Fund Balance Reporting and Other
Governmental Fund Type Definitions.” Statement No. 54 requires the use of new fund balance classifications that compose a
hierarchy primarily based upon the extent to which the City is bound to follow constraints on the use of
governmental fund resources. These classifications are described in note 2m.

The Largest Taxpayers table includes entities with a fiscal year 2018 tax liability greater than $15 million. The methodology used in creating the table involves the
search of the title holder(s) of all major parcels of property in the City. This methodology does not necessarily locate all parcels owned by affiliates nor does it
differentiate between percentage ownership in particular parcel.

(2)

Pursuant to Chapter 59 of the General Laws, Section 4, personal property consists of movable physical items not permanently attached to real estate. Many items
of personal property are exempt from taxation in Massachusetts. There are three general types of personal property that are taxable: business and professional
furnishings, machinery used in the conduct of business, and personal property of public utilities.

CITY OF BOSTON
SELECTED DEMOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION

SELECTED DEMOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION
The following report has been prepared by the Boston Planning and Development Agency (the "BPDA"),
formerly the Boston Redevelopment Authority, for inclusion in the Official Statement. The report describes the
principal components of the economy of the City of Boston (the “City” or “Boston”) and presents major economic,
demographic and market indicators, and historical, statistical and other information.
This report contains estimates that are based on expectations and assumptions that existed at the time estimates
were prepared. In light of the important factors that may materially affect economic conditions of the City, the
inclusion in this report of such estimates should not be regarded as a representation of the BPDA or the City that
such estimates will occur.
The information contained herein has been furnished by the BPDA and certain information has been obtained
from other sources which are believed to be reliable, but is not guaranteed as to accuracy or completeness, and is not
to be construed as a representation of the underwriters of the Bonds or, as to information from other sources, of the
BPDA or the City.

THE BOSTON ECONOMY
Boston is the twenty-second largest city, in terms of population, in the United States and the economic hub
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Commonwealth”). It is a center for professional services, business,
finance, technology, research and development, higher education and health care, as well as for transportation,
exports, communications, culture and entertainment. Boston is the capital of the Commonwealth and is host to
several federal regional offices.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (“ACS”), Boston’s population for
2017 was 683,015. The BPDA Research Division estimates there are 812,153 full and part-time, payroll and nonpayroll jobs in Boston as of 2017 based on data provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (“BEA”) and
Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development (“EOLWD”). Boston’s jobs represent 17%
of the total statewide jobs.
Overview of Recent Economic Conditions
Boston’s economy, on average, outperformed both Massachusetts and the nation in terms of job growth
from 2007 to 2017. During that period, Boston’s average annual job growth was 2%. Following the start of the Great
Recession in December 2007, the national economy experienced rising unemployment and deteriorating economic
conditions. In late 2008 Boston’s economy began to show signs of a weakening labor market, and economic
conditions worsened from late 2008 until February 2010, when positive job growth returned. Payroll jobs grew in
Boston at an average annual rate of 2% from 2010 through 2017, exceeding the national recovery. Boston’s
unemployment rate for 2018 was 3.1%, 0.8 percentage points less than the national rate. 1
Similar to the job market, Boston’s office real estate market experienced a downward shift beginning in the
last half of 2008 through mid-2010. The housing market in Boston, also hurt by the recession’s rising foreclosures
and tight lending market, saw reductions in sales volumes and small to moderate drops in prices. However, Boston’s
commercial real estate market rebounded and continues to show strong growth. Factors influencing commercial
development include growth in high tech sectors, high rents, low interest rates, low unemployment rates, and
population growth. Residential markets continue to show strong growth with increasing prices and stable sales
volumes. Lower vacancies and population growth coincide with higher price levels and rents. The 2018 Q4 median
sales price for a single family home in Boston was $600,000 according to the Department of Neighborhood
Development using Banker & Tradesman data.
Statistical Data
Statistical data relating to population, employment and income are derived primarily from four separate
sources: the U.S. Census Bureau; the BEA; the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (the “BLS”);
and the City of Boston and the BPDA, each of which is described below.
The Census Bureau publishes information about population, housing and the economy. The most recent
decennial Census data are from the 2010 Census. In addition, some monthly, quarterly and annual data are available
through December 2017 on certain topics for the region, the Commonwealth, and Metropolitan Boston. 2 The Census
Bureau also publishes the American Community Survey, which provides data through 2017 on a citywide basis and
by census tract.
The BEA publishes quarterly and annual statistics on income and employment. The most recent annual
figures for the nation, Massachusetts and Metropolitan Boston are for 2017. The BLS publishes data and reports
about the workforce and related subjects including unemployment rates, area wages, and cost-of-living adjustments.
The most recent monthly data are for December 2018.
The City and the BPDA prepare reports and compile data on the population and economy of the City and
its neighborhoods. The BPDA also analyzes and reports on local, regional, state and national trends obtained from
1

Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development (EOLWD), U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
Federal data sources have three prevailing definitions of the Boston Metropolitan Area. Each table with Metropolitan data explains whether
Metropolitan Boston refers to: the Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”), the New England City and Town Area (“NECTA”), or Combined
Statistical Area (“CSA”). Revised data was unavailable for Boston-Cambridge-Quincy MA-NH MSA and NECTA. All data was revised to
reflect the new Boston-Cambridge-Newton MA-NH MSA and NECTA Division.

public and private sources on the following topics: employment, occupations, large employers, City schools,
universities and colleges, medical institutions, tourism and lodging, transportation, office and industrial markets,
housing, building activity, urban redevelopment, and infrastructure projects.
The statistical data contained in this report represent the latest published data available. While the City
believes that it has used the most recent available data in this report, the data contained herein may not reflect
current conditions or trends because of publication lags resulting from time required to collect, tabulate and publish
the data. Moreover, statistical data are approximations and generalizations subject to various sources of error
inherent in the statistical process, and may be revised on the basis of additional data. The statistical data contained
herein describes past activity and are not presented in order to suggest the continuation of any trend, or to predict
future economic activity either in particular categories or in general.
Population, Income and Employment
Boston’s population from the 2010 Census was 617,594, which represented a 4.8% increase from the 2000
count of 589,141. The Census Bureau’s 2010 population count for Metropolitan Boston was 4,552,402, representing
an increase of 3.7% since 2000. Massachusetts’ 2010 Census enumeration was 6,547,629, a gain of 3.1% over the
2000 count. The most recent ACS (2017) estimates the City of Boston’s total population to be 683,015. The
compound annual growth for the City from the 2010 decennial census through 2017 is 1.7%. Recent trends suggest
Boston’s population is growing at a faster rate than in prior decades.

Suffolk) and two counties in New Hampshire (Rockingham and Strafford), as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 1990, 2000, and 2010 Decennial Census; 2016 and 2017 American Community Survey one-year estimates,
December 2018.

The 2017 ACS showed that Boston’s racial composition was White, Non-Hispanic 43.9%; Black, NonHispanic 23.1%; Hispanic 20.4%; Asian/Pacific Islander 9.7%; Multi-racial 1.9%; other single race 0.7%; and
Native American 0.2%. The Hispanic and Asian populations have grown dramatically, growing about 36.1% and
50.8% respectively, from 2000 to 2017, while other populations have seen small growth or decline. Immigration has
been a prime driver of increases in the Hispanic and Asian populations. In 2017, the foreign-born population, which
was 28.8% Hispanic (of any race), 24.2% Asian, 30.3% Black, and 30.6% white, made up 29.2% of Boston’s total
population.
Boston continues to be a city of young adults due to the large number of students and young professionals
living and working in the City; 35% of all persons in Boston in 2010 were between 20 and 34 years old compared to
33% in 2000. The fastest growing age group in Boston between 2000 and 2017 was the age group 55 to 64, which
saw a 66.6% increase. This is consistent with national trends and the aging of the baby boomer population. Boston’s
elderly population (ages 65 and over) grew to 79,984 people, but has remained just over 10% of the total population.
Boston’s population of school age children (ages 5 to 14) is 54,222, a level it has maintained since the dramatic fall
from over 100,000 in the 1970s.
Along with population growth, the number of households in Boston has also grown, to 268,304 according
to the 2017 ACS. The share of these households that are families (related or married people living together) remains
stable at 47.7% of all households in 2017. The group quarters population, primarily students in dormitories,
increased
ease from 2010, up to 46,196 in 2017. Household size increased from 2.26 persons in 2010 to 2.37 persons in
2017.
7. In 2017, Massachusetts had a population of approximately 6.8 million people and 4.8 million jobs, according
to BEA annual data. Between 2013 and 2017 the number of jobs in Massachusetts grew by 2.4%. Massachusetts
personal income, net inflation, grew at an average annual rate of 3.4% from 2013 to 2017, four tenths of a
percentage point greater than the national income growth over the same period.
3

Metropolitan Boston had 4.8 million people and 3.6 million jobs in 2017. From 2013 through 2017,
Metropolitan Boston experienced an average annual growth in jobs of 2.5%. The MSA’s total personal income, net
inflation, from 2013 through 2017 grew at an average annual rate of 3.7%, slightly outpacing national trends during
that period.

Employment Structure, Employment Trends and Occupational Changes
Boston has seen recent growth in professional and technical services, health care, and transportation and
warehousing. The largest industries in the city are health care and social assistance, professional and technical
services, finance and insurance, government, accommodation and food services, and education.
The table below shows Boston’s employment growth by industry category for 2013 through 2017. The
industry categories are in the North American Industrial Classification System (“NAICS”) format, which the BEA
began using in 2001. Suffolk County data is mathematically reduced to the Boston geography using unemployment
insurance coverage data (Employment Security, ES-202, for cities and towns from the Massachusetts Executive
Office of Labor and Workforce Development (“EOLWD”)).
Total employment in Boston rose to the highest level in recent decades and unemployment fell below three
percent in the last quarter of 2018. Boston’s job growth has been positive across most industries since the recession,
and is mostly concentrated in health care and social assistance, professional and technical services, and
accommodation and food services. The health care and social assistance industry employs the largest number of
people in Boston, 18.3 percent of total jobs, while transportation and warehousing has surpassed professional and
technical services as the fastest growing industry since the recession at 8.1% per year. The job growth in
transportation and warehousing is predominantly in non-payroll positions. Educational services is an area of
specialization for Boston with an employment share three times the national average. The most recent economic
conditions in Boston show steady growth in the labor market.

In addition to this strong overall growth, the high tech sector jobs grew by an average annual rate of 8.9%
since 2010. Boston’s high tech industries benefit from supportive public policies and high tech clusters that foster
synergistic innovation. Major Boston high tech clusters include the Innovation District, which provides startups a
place to grow, and world class centers for medical research in the Longwood Medical Area and Massachusetts
General Hospital campus. Major companies have also moved to new office spaces throughout Boston. In October
2017, Reebok moved into its new 220,000 square foot headquarters at the Innovation and Design Building in the
Seaport District. In 2018, Bose began outfitting a 98,000 square foot office space in Boston Landing. The fantasy
sports website DraftKings announced plans to double the size of its headquarters in a move to Boston’s Back Bay,
while Haemonetics Corp, a Braintree-based company that manufactures blood management devices, announced
plans to move into DraftKing’s former office space in the Financial District in 2019. 3 Though Boston was not
selected as the site of Amazon’s second headquarters, the company moved into a 150,000 square foot office on
Summer St and confirmed a plan to construct 430,000 square feet of office space and bring 2,000 employees to an
18-story office building in Seaport Square. Companies expected to move into Boston in the near future include
Verizon, which signed a 20-year lease for the office tower to be built over North Station and PTC, a computer
software company that will occupy office space in the Seaport.
The following table indicates that between 1970 and 2017, the share of white collar workers in Boston’s
resident labor force increased from 55% to 69%, while the share of blue collar workers decreased from 45% to 31%.
Between 2000 and 2017, the proportion of white collar to blue collar workers in the City remained approximately
the same.

Unemployment
According to the Massachusetts EOLWD, Boston’s average unemployment rate from January through
December 2018 was 3.1%, 0.8 percentage points lower than the national unemployment rate. Boston’s
unemployment rate during 2017 and 2018 was the lowest it has been since 2000. The 2018 unemployment rates for
Metropolitan Boston and Massachusetts were 2.9 and 3.4%, respectively. Current unemployment rates are at historic
low levels for Boston, Massachusetts and the U.S. These low rates suggest the region is at full employment and that
there is a tightening of the labor market.

Labor Force and Education
Due to the growing size and increasing age of the population as well as the rising labor force participation
of women, minorities, youth and the elderly, Boston’s resident labor force steadily rose from 1980 to 2017.
According to the Decennial censuses, Boston’s population grew by 4.6% between 1980 and 2000, and another 4.8%
between 2000 and 2010. Meanwhile, the resident labor force grew 11.9% between 1980 and 2000, and another
13.7% between 2000 and 2010. According to 1-year ACS surveys, Boston’s population grew 9.9% between 2010
and 2017 to 683,015, of which residents 409,910 were in the labor force and 381,602 were employed. The
educational attainment of Boston residents, measured as the share of residents over the age of 25 with at least a
bachelor’s degree, also improved over the 1980 to 2000 period according to the Decennial Censuses from 20.3% to
35.6%. From 2010 to 2017 according to the 1-year ACS, this share grew even further from 35.6% to 48.2%.
Improving educational attainment has supported the City’s transition to a knowledge-based economy.

policies and programs ensure that low-income Boston residents, both youth and adult, are connected to the training
necessary to obtain career-oriented employment that leads to economic stability. Programs and services offered
through OWD grants include adult basic education, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), High School
diploma/HiSET, occupational skills training, transitional job experience, career exploration and support services
which address a wide range of individual and family needs.
In fiscal 2018, OWD supported over 100 community organizations with more than $14 million in funding,
to provide a variety of services to greater Boston’s residents. These services included apprenticeship training in
hospitality, facilities maintenances, emergency medical services, and the building trades; internship and alternative
education programs for young adults; summer youth employment; and adult ESOL programs. OWD also oversees
and convenes the region’s one-stop career centers (American Job Centers), which served 15,515 job-seekers and 761
employers. In addition, funding from OWD served 1,583 young people ages 14 to 24 with a variety of education and
skills development programming. Youth Options Unlimited (YOU), a division of OWD that works with at-risk
youth, provided case-management services to 469 young people, placing 202 into subsidized jobs and 90 into
unsubsidized jobs. Linkage contributions paid into the Neighborhood Jobs Trust provide supplemental sources of
funding for job training and adult education programs. For a full discussion of the City’s jobs linkage program, as
well as the housing linkage program, see “The Linkage Program,” later in this program.
Income, Wages, and Cost of Living
Per capita personal income for Suffolk County was $75,711 in 2017, 43.1% above the national per capita
personal income of $52,899, according to the BEA. According to the 2017 1-year ACS, Boston residents constitute
approximately 85.6% of the county’s population. The summary table below shows the per capita income from 1980
through 2017 for Suffolk County, Metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts and the nation. Annual growth for per capita
income in Suffolk County was about double the national average for Massachusetts, Metropolitan Boston and
Suffolk County from 2000 to 2017. The city’s median household income (in fixed 2018 dollars) based on Census
data from the ACS was $63,533 in 2017. Per capita personal income reflects earned income of persons residing in
the named areas plus rents, interest and other unearned income and transfer payments from governmental entities.
As such, these figures take into account income sources not included in the survey of average annual wages in the
following paragraph, which reflect earned income of persons who work (but do not necessarily reside) in the named
areas.

Medical and Higher Educational Institutions
Boston’s medical and educational institutions are important components of its economy, providing
employment opportunities for residents of the City and Metropolitan Boston. Expenditures by these institutions, as
well as their employees, patients, students and visitors stimulate the City’s trade and service sectors. There are
twenty-one in-patient hospitals located within the City with a combined total of 6,108 beds as of 2018. The largest
of these are Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, Tufts New England Medical Center and Boston Medical Center. The City is
also home to the medical, dental and public health schools of Harvard, Tufts and Boston University, and to 25 public
neighborhood health clinics, as well as private health maintenance organizations and membership clinics. For the
24th consecutive year, Boston received more National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding than any other city in the
nation. Boston received a total of $2.1 billion in NIH awards for fiscal year 2018, with eight organizations receiving
over $125 million each.
Boston is home to top universities such as Boston University, Northeastern University, and University of
Massachusetts (UMass) Boston. As of academic year 2017-2018, data from the City of Boston’s University
Accountability Ordinance and Department of Neighborhood Development indicate that the City’s universities and
colleges had a combined enrollment of 147,689 full- and part-time students. 4 This is an increase of close to 4,000
students since 2013. This number includes the professional and graduate schools of Harvard and Tufts which are
located in Boston, but does not include MIT or undergraduate enrollment at Harvard or Tufts, whose principal
campuses are located in Cambridge and Medford, respectively. Based on total graduate, undergraduate and
professional school enrollment, Northeastern University enrolled the most students during the fall of 2017 at 30,538,
followed by Boston University at 27,861. Boston, with nearly 10% of the Commonwealth’s population, has about a
quarter of the statewide college student enrollment. According to the Department of Neighborhood Development,
1,106 dormitory beds were permitted and 647 beds were completed in 2017. 624 fewer students are living in privatehousing compared to 2016. In total, 4,241 beds have been built between 2011 and 2017, accounting for 23% of the
goal of 18,500 beds set out in the Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030 plan. Another 2,886 beds are under
construction or soon to be under construction at Emerson, Emmanuel and Northeastern. The University of
Massachusetts Boston opened its first on-campus housing in the fall of 2018; the privately operated dorm provides
housing for 1,089 students at the formerly commuter college.
In 2018, the BPDA approved 1.2 million square feet of institutional development across the city.
Additionally, 686,000 square feet are under construction and 1 million square feet were completed. These new
projects primarily came from major educational and medical institutions. The projects highlighted below capture
major institutional developments completed, under construction and approved in the past year.

Tourism and Culture
Boston ranks among the top ten destinations in North America for conventions, meetings and trade shows,
based on the number and quality of the shows booked. Boston currently has three main convention sites—the John
B. Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center (“Hynes”), the Seaport World Trade Center and the 2.1 million
square-foot Boston Convention & Exhibition Center (“BCEC”), which is the largest building in New England and
capable of hosting large national and international events. In late summer of 2014, the Massachusetts Convention
Center Authority (“MCCA”) also opened “The Lawn on D,” a flexible outdoor public and event space immediately
adjacent to the BCEC. In 2017 the Hynes and the BCEC hosted a combined total of 325 events with an aggregate of
850,000 attendees. This resulted in approximately 615,000 hotel room nights and generated an overall economic
impact of approximately $735 million, according to the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority (“MCCA”).
Total fiscal 2018 operating revenues totaled $76.3 million, a three percent increase from the previous year. 5
Downtown Boston saw the addition of significant new cultural amenities in 2018. The Patios opened on
City Hall Plaza in the summer 2018, providing a local gathering spot, space for weekly pop-up events and a main
pavilion structure. This revitalization project is one in a series of planned improved uses for the Plaza. Other uses of
public space included the Open Newbury Street events, which closed Newbury Street in the Back Bay to cars on
three Sundays. Open Newbury Street events provided attendees with indoor and outdoor shopping experiences and
dining. The large redevelopment of the North Station Boston Garden area, a 1.87 million square foot mixed use
development, was approved in 2013 and broke ground in January 2016. Phase 1 of the project was completed in late
2018 and includes improvements to North Station, a four-level below-grade parking garage, as well as a four to six

story podium. Phase 2 is currently under construction and will consists of a 38-story residential tower with
approximately 440 units and an 11-story hotel with 269 rooms. Phase 3 was approved by the BPDA Board and will
include an office tower of up to 651,500 square feet. The project also encompasses Champions Row, which is the
new entrance to the TD Garden and contains restaurants and a movie theater which will open in 2019. The project
site is a 2.8 acre vacant parcel at the former site of the original Boston Garden.
Hotel Market
Between 2000 and 2009, 25 hotels opened in the City, making up one-third of the current hotel stock.
Boston’s favorable hotel market and the construction of the BCEC stimulated considerable new development over
this period. Two hotels opened in 2009: the 114-room Ames Hotel, an adaptive reuse of an historic office building
near Government Center, and the 235-room “W” Hotel in the Theater District. Two additional hotels opened in
2013: a 175 room Marriott Residence Inn in the Fenway/Kenmore district and a 120 room Marriott Residence Inn as
an adaptive reuse of the Stillings Building in South Boston, near the BCEC convention center. The 136 room Envoy
hotel opened in 2015 in the Seaport’s Innovation District. The Aloft and Element, both on D Street, and the Godfrey
Hotel on Washington Street in Downtown Crossing all opened in 2016. In 2017, the 326 room YOTEL opened in
the Seaport District. As of January 2018, Boston had 87 hotels open for business and a total of 21,193 hotel rooms in
establishments of fifty or more rooms. 6
At the start of 2018, 325,000 square feet of hotel development was under construction in Roxbury, the
West End and Brighton, including the 100 room Marriot on Melnea Cass Boulevard, the 220 room Courtyard
Marriot Hotel on Beverly Street and the 162 room Cleveland Circle hotel on Chestnut Hill Avenue. The Courtyard
Marriot Hotel finished construction early in 2018 and opened with 220 rooms near TD Garden in the North End.
The AC Hotel in Cleveland Circle was finished in April and opened its 162 rooms in June as part of the greater
development plan for “the Circle”. Another AC Hotel opened in the South End near the Ink Block development as a
205-room boutique hotel with a fitness center and meeting space that can accommodate up to 140 people. In Back
Bay, the Four Seasons Hotel at One Dalton Street, which will include 215 rooms and 41 suites, is expected to open
in early 2019. Additionally, two hotels in the Seaport district broke ground: Marine Wharf and Omni Hotel. The
Marine Wharf project will a include 245-room Hilton hotel and a 166-room Homewood Suite. Nearby, the Omni
Hotel will feature 1,055 guest rooms and 52 suites, with an all-day restaurant, fitness center, spa and the largest hotel
ballroom in the Seaport. It is set to open in early 2021.
The average occupancy rate of hotels in Boston was 79.4% over the past 10 years, according to the latest
data from the Pinnacle Perspective Monthly Report. The occupancy rate dipped in 2009 with the Recession but soon
recovered, reaching a year to date average of 84.4% in November 2018. Excluding the recession years, these
statistics suggest that Boston has a robust hotel market.
The City’s Average Daily Rate (“ADR”) represents the average rate paid per room over a given period of
time. The ADR is highly correlated with the occupancy rate, which follows the same trend but on a lagged basis.
The ADR, in fixed 2018 dollars, grew 18.4% from $228.15 in 1990 to $270.22 in 2018. The hotel room inventory
has increased since 1990, with upper scale hotels built during the 1990s contributing to higher daily rates, along with
increased demand for hotel stays. The table below shows the room supply, occupancy rate, ADR and revenue per
available room for Boston for the years 1990, 2000, and 2005 through 2018. The hotel industry provided 11,569
direct jobs in Boston for 2017, accounting for 1.8% of Boston’s total payroll jobs and 32.7% of Massachusetts’ hotel
industry employment.

Transportation
Boston is a major national and international air terminus, a seaport and the center of New England’s rail,
truck and bus service. The City is served by three limited-access interstate highways: I-90 (the “Massachusetts
Turnpike”), which stretches 138 miles westward from downtown Boston to the New York State border; I-95, the
East Coast’s principal north-south highway, which connects Greater Boston to Portland, Maine to the north and New
York City and Washington, D.C. to the south; and I-93, another north-south interstate highway that extends from
just south of the City north to New Hampshire.
Transportation planning includes both major highway and mass transit programs. The Massachusetts
Department of Transportation (“MassDOT”) oversees statewide transportation services across several divisions: rail
and transit, aeronautics, highway, the Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) and planning and enterprise. While
MassDOT’s rail and transit division operates across Massachusetts, transit within the Greater Boston Area is
overseen by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (“MBTA”). The MBTA provides commuter rail,
subway, local bus and express bus services to 175 cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts, offering public transit
to a population of almost 4.8 million people in an area of 3,240 square miles. The MBTA is the fifth largest mass
transit system in the nation as determined by ridership, providing 1.3 million unlinked passenger trips per day. In
2017, for the first time, the MBTA and MassDOT jointly produced a Capital Investment Plan (“CIP”), integrating
the decision making process around funding allocation and aligning the agencies’ goals and program evaluation
procedures. 7 The 2019 CIP allocates a total of $17.3 billion in capital investments for fiscal years 2019 to 2023
across programs by level of priority: (1) improving reliability through maintenance and repair of existing assets
(50% of total funding); (2) modernizing assets to meet updated safety or accessibility requirements (28%); (3)
expanding capacity to accommodate increased ridership (12%). The remaining funds are allocated to planning and
enterprise services and Chapter 90 funding for reimbursement of municipal road-construction (10%).
The MBTA is scheduled to spend $6.9 billion over the next five years, beginning with $1.07 billion in
fiscal year 2019. Planned and recommended spending for fiscal years 2019 to 2023 is broken down into the
following categories: (i) Revenue vehicles ($1.29 billion); (ii) Track, signal and power programs ($950 million); (iii)
Facilities ($355 million); (iv) Commuter Rail Safety and Resiliency ($637.5 million); (v) Accessibility programs
($265 million); and (vi) Expansion projects ($1.42 billion). Additional priority projects for the MBTA include the
fleet overhaul of the Red and Orange lines, the Green Line Extension to Union Square in Somerville and College
Avenue in Medford, the new automated fare collection system (AFC 2.0), and Silver Line extension to Chelsea. The

construction of Blue Hill Avenue station along the Fairmount commuter line should be complete in 2019.
In addition to MBTA-specific programs, the CIP designates funding for several other Boston area
transportation projects. MassDOT will continue the planning and environmental review phase of the I-90 Allston
Interchange Project. This project will replace the I-90 viaduct carrying the Mass Turnpike into Boston through
Allston, construct a new commuter rail station and improve pedestrian and bicycle pathways along Cambridge Street
and to the Charles River. Additionally, the CIP designates funding for MassDOT, in cooperation with the Federal
Railroad Administration, Amtrak and the MBTA, to study potential expansions and improvements to South Station.
South Station, one of three major high speed rail terminals on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor (“NEC”), currently hosts
high speed intercity passenger rail (“HSIPR”), including Amtrak Acela Express and Northeast Regional services. It
is the terminus for Amtrak’s Lake Shore Limited service between Boston and Chicago, as well as for MBTA
commuter rail, subway and guideway bus services. Potential changes to the Station include improvements to the
tracks, platforms, signals and passenger facilities, as well as possible joint public/private development over and
around the station.
The proposed fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2023 Boston Transportation Capital Plan draws on City, State
and Federal sources, to invest $967 million over the next five years in implementing the core initiatives outlined in
Go Boston 2030. The Capital Plan makes critical investments to improve safety for Boston’s most vulnerable street
users with a focus on roadway corridors, safe crossings and traffic calming on residential streets and in smallbusiness districts. Vision Zero, funded $14.4 million over the five year period, will make targeted safety
improvements at corridors and intersections with known safety challenges, and to traffic-calm residential streets.
Seaport and Airport
The Massachusetts Port Authority (“Massport”) was created by the state legislature to develop and manage
the City’s major air and sea transportation centers. Massport is financially independent, and the City is not
responsible for any debt or other obligations incurred by Massport. Heavy use of Boston Logan International Airport
(“Logan Airport”) and the Port of Boston have induced significant expansion of both facilities. Massport’s net
investment in Boston’s port facilities for ongoing and proposed projects, according to its fiscal 2018-2022 Capital
Program, is projected to be $2.4 billion in airport projects and $784.2 million in maritime development and other
capital projects. 8
The Port of Boston serves the six-state New England region as a natural deep-water port supporting import
and export of containerized bulk and general cargo. The port also provides ship repair supply services, customs and
international freight forwarding services, intermodal cargo warehouse facilities and other maritime support services.
Massport’s Conley Container Terminal provides containerized freight water access to other container terminals
across the world. The Port of Boston is also a major cruise port. The cruise terminal served 389,619 passengers in
2018, a modest increase of 0.4% compared to 2017. The cruise port mainly operates in the months of April through
November. 9
The Port of Boston ranks among the top 25 U.S. ports by container volume. 10 The Port handled 298,036
boxed containers in calendar year 2018, an increase of 10% percent over 2017, and includes imports, exports, and
empties. 11 The port also handled 52,400 automobiles in 2018, an increase of 6% from 2017. Additionally, the port
handled 76,340 cement metric tons in 2018, which is an 18% decrease from 2017’s tonnage.
As of October 2018, Logan Airport had served a total of 34.5 million domestic and international passengers
for the year, a 6.7% increase from the 32.4 million passengers served during the same period in 2017. Logan Airport
also plays an important role as a center for processing domestic and international air cargo. In October 2018, year to
date totals for combined cargo and mail volume was 581.8 million pounds, a 4.5% increase from the 556.9 million
pounds handled in 2017. 12

Construction Activity
The following table provides annual building permit revenues and an estimate of construction activity in
the City for fiscal years 2009 to 2018. Building permits issued do not necessarily result in construction activity. The
estimated revenue from building permit fees during fiscal year 2018 indicated the potential for $5.4 billion in
construction activity compared to an estimate of $7.5 billion for fiscal year 2017. Between 2017 and 2018, building
permit revenue decreased by 27% in fixed terms. In 2018, the BPDA Board approved $6.9 billion in new projects,
an increase of 21% over 2017, which will result in additional permit applications in 2019, and there was increase in
property tax levy of $77.6 million in 2018 due to new construction. 13

Large Public Sector Projects
The Community Preservation Act (“CPA”), which passed in November 2016, will help the City of Boston
achieve its housing and economic goals by generating revenue that is specifically allocated to one of three project
categories: creating affordable housing units, restoring parks and recreational open space, and preserving historical
sites. Through a one percent surcharge on real property tax that began in July 2017, Boston received $20.4 million in
2018, including a $4 million match from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue through the Community
Preservation Trust Fund. A committee of nine Boston residents will make recommendations to Boston’s City
Council on CPA projects that fall into the three CPA eligible project categories. As of June 2018, Mayor Walsh has
recommended 35 projects to receive a total of $8 million of funds in a pilot round of funding.
Office Market and New Development
The City and its neighborhoods had approximately 66.8 million square feet of office space in the third
quarter of 2018. Boston’s direct vacancy rate was 6.8%, according to realty firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL). Boston’s
YTD net absorption of office space was 925,664 square feet. Compared to this time last year (third quarter of 2017),
YTD net absorption has increased by 247% and the vacancy rate has decreased by 3%. For certain areas within
Boston, leasing activity has become more robust. The Seaport District and Back Bay have significantly higher
absorption rates than last year. The average asking rent citywide in 2018 Q3 was $61.63, which remains competitive
at $25 less per square foot on average than the tighter Cambridge office market.

In 2018, about 4 million square feet of office space was approved by the BPDA Board, marking the highest
level of office square footage annually approved since 1996. Several projects with office square footage were
approved, including Exchange South End, a $1.45 billion redevelopment of the former Boston Flower Exchange.
The project entails over 600,000 square feet office space, in addition to retail, technological, civic and incubator
space. In East Boston, the first phase of redeveloping Suffolk Downs, a historic horserace track, was approved and
will include two office buildings totaling to 520,000 square feet. Changes to Phase 3 of the Boston Garden project
(“The Hub on Causeway”) in the West End, which consists of a 651,500 office tower, were also approved. In
Dorchester, the former Boston Globe Headquarters will be renovated to a 695,000 office building dubbed the BEAT
(the Boston Exchange for Accelerated Technology), with creative office, technology and life science uses.
The BEAT was approved in April 2018 and is currently under construction. Other projects underway
include 1785 Columbus Avenue, an office building of approximately 139,200 square feet which will serve Horizons
for Homeless Children, as well as other social service programs. In the Seaport district, a 13-story 298,700 square
foot office building near the Innovation and Design Building was approved in 2016 and went under construction this
past April. The project will include ground-level retail, bicycle storage, locker rooms with showers and a 12,000
square foot public plaza. In the South End, an office building of 218,500 square feet at 321 Harrison Avenue, near
the Ink Block development, was also permitted in April. It will sit atop a 300 car garage and include open green
space with outdoor seating. Recently completed projects include a 17-story, 425,000 square foot office building in
the Seaport District at 121 Seaport Boulevard. The building was completed in April 2018 and is 100% leased to
tenants such as PTC, a company that develops Internet of Things (IoT) and Augmented Reality technology, and
Alexion Pharmaceuticals. Both companies have moved their global headquarters to the building. Another office
building in Brighton, as part of the Boston Landing development, was completed in May 2018 with biotech and lab
uses.
Retail Market
In 2017, there were a total of 100,641 employees in retail trade and accommodation and food services in
Boston, with 35,744 in retail and 64,897 in accommodation and food services. The retail sector is complemented by
an estimated 10,347 employees in personal services businesses, which include such services as repair and
maintenance, hair and nail care and laundry and dry cleaning service. According to the 2012 Economic Census,
about 2,161 retail establishments were located in the City with estimated total sales of $8.62 billion in 2018 dollars.
As of January 2019, the food service and eating and drinking establishment industry in Boston (restaurants and bars)
consists of just over 3,000 active food establishments. 14

The Boston Main Streets initiative established in 1995 is a public-private partnership to revitalize
neighborhood commercial districts through independent 501c3 non-profit organizations. The program now includes
20 neighborhoods throughout Boston and is the largest Urban Main Streets program in the country. This past fiscal
year (2018), 110 new and expanded businesses opened in Main Streets districts, creating 525 new jobs. Business
assistance was provided to 2,497 small businesses. 1,175 special district promotional events generated over 28,446
volunteer hours and the local Main Streets Districts storefront occupancy rates were at an average of 95%.
The retail real estate market in 2018 remained strong. According to CoStar, Boston’s retail vacancy rate in
2018 Q3 was 2.1%. Retail rents were strong, particularly in the Downtown core and immediate surrounding areas.
Quoted retail rental rates were $33.49 per square foot for 2018.
Important market and supermarket developments have taken place throughout Boston’s neighborhoods.
Twenty-four new or expanded supermarkets have opened in Boston’s neighborhoods since 1992, including three
major openings in 2015. The first of these was the Boston Public Market, a year-round market featuring fresh,
locally sourced food from over 38 vendors on Hanover Street. Also opening in 2015 was a 25,000 square foot Roche
Bros. in the Burnham Building in Downtown Crossing, including a street-level shop serving pre-made meals and a
full-service supermarket downstairs. The third development occurring in 2015 was the opening of a Whole Foods in
the Ink Block development housed in the former Boston Herald property in the South End. In 2017, Trader Joes
opened its second Boston location in the lobby of the Continuum apartment building in Allston, featuring a belowground parking garage. Among the projects currently under construction is a 60,000 square foot Star Market at the
Hub on Causeway at TD Garden. Once complete, this Star Market will be Boston’s largest supermarket. Currently, a
1.9 million square foot redevelopment of the 11-acre Stop & Shop supermarket in Allston (dubbed “Allston Yards”)
is under review. If approved by the BPDA Board, it will introduce a new Stop & Shop supermarket with up to 1,300
parking spaces, in addition to office space and 1,050 residences.
Industrial Market and Recent Developments
The Boston/Suffolk County sub-market had approximately 25 million square feet of industrial space and 6
million square feet of flex space in the third quarter of 2018, according to CoStar. The vacancy rates in 2018 Q3
were approximately 7.5% for industrial and 18.5% for flex. The average asking rent for industrial was $16.54 per
square foot NNN (“Net-Net-Net”, or net property tax, insurance, and maintenance), and $23.86 per square foot NNN
for flex. From 2014 to 2018 Q3, quoted rental rates for flex increased by 16%, while rates for all industrial increased
25%.
The Raymond L. Flynn Marine Park (RLFMP), formerly the Boston Marine Industrial Park, consists of
over three million square feet of developed real estate. The RLFMP, zoned for industrial and marine uses and close
to downtown Boston, is a sought after location for state-of-the-art research and development. The RLFMP continues
to sustain robust industrial uses such as ship repair, seafood processing and design wholesale business clusters,
along with small scale manufacturing and life science research and technology companies. In October 2017,
America’s Test Kitchen and Reebok became the latest additions to the Innovation and Design building located
within the Park, occupying 275,000 square feet of space.

17

The BPDA submitted a proposed update to the RLFMP Master Plan to the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts for approval in 2018. The proposed Master Plan update will increase the existing zoned Floor to Area
Ratio (FAR) from 2 to 4, allowing for additional density and development potential. The BPDA also released an
RFP to redevelop a vacant 30,000 SF building into an anticipated industrial R&D facility containing 80,000 to
100,000 SF, which would be allowed under the proposed zoning change.
Construction was completed on the core and shell of a new 120,000 SF R&D industrial building in January
2019 at the RLFMP. The developer intends to break ground in spring 2019 on two additional industrial R&D
buildings each consisting of 120,000 SF for a total build-out of 360,000 SF. The "New Boston Seafood" site located
at 310 Northern Avenue is on the market for sale. The successful bidder is anticipated to also take advantage of the
proposed new zoning FAR to replace the aging 80,000 SF seafood facility with a new industrial R&D facility of
700,000 SF or more. The current seafood-related occupants will likely be relocated to another location in the
RLFMP.
A new state of the art seafood processing facility in the Massport Marine Terminal (MMT) in the RLFMP
broke ground in 2018. Currently operating from three separate facilities in Boston and Peabody, long time RLFMP
tenant Stavis Seafoods will consolidate its operations into the new 120,000 SF seafood facility. The developer also
expects to break ground on a new cold storage facility and parking garage on MMT.
Housing Stock, Housing Values, and Development
There were 293,538 housing units in Boston according to the 1-year 2017 ACS. Of the 268,304 occupied units,
35% were owner-occupied and 65% were renter-occupied. Vacant housing units totaled 25,234, while the
homeowner unit vacancy rate was 1.8% and the rental unit vacancy rate was 2.8. The 2017 ACS shows that the
median monthly cost for home owners with a mortgage was $2,384 and the gross monthly rent (for existing renters
rather than advertised rents) was $1,595. Gross rents are what tenants pay out of pocket and the availability of public
and subsidized housing makes this value much lower than advertised market rents for newly available units.
Preliminary data for 2018 real estate trends were provided by the City’s Department of Neighborhood
Development. These data show that the median rent for an apartment in Boston as advertised by the Multiple Listing
Service (“MLS”) was $2,500 per month for all apartment sizes and types between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the
third quarter of 2018, the most recent data available. The citywide median advertised rents in this sample grew
10.9% compared to the previous four quarters. Median rents for an apartment in Boston’s neighborhoods ranged
from a high of $3,725 in the South Boston Waterfront to a low of $1,900 in Hyde Park.

City of Boston, Department of Neighborhood Development using Banker & Tradesman data, January 2019.

When housing prices began to fall and sales volume slackened following 2005, foreclosure deeds rose
through 2008, peaking at 1,215, while petitions to foreclose (the first step in the foreclosure process) peaked at 2,432
in 2007. 15 Since then, foreclosure deeds have remained significantly lower than the peak. Foreclosure deeds fell for
the second straight year, decreasing from 139 in 2017 to 103 in 2018. Petitions to foreclose also declined from 418
to 336.
In the second quarter of 2018, 1,396 new or converted housing units were permitted for construction in the
City. 16 This number surpasses by 211% the target set out for Q2 2018 in the Housing Boston 2030 Plan. Launched
in 2014, Housing Boston 2030 laid out a plan for the creation of 53,000 new units by 2030 to accommodate
Boston’s growing population, of which 17,993 were completed by the end of Q2 2018. In September 2018, the City
revised its housing goal to 69,000 new units by 2030 to accommodate the population growth that was exceeding
initial growth estimates. In 2017, the BPDA Board approved 4.7 million square feet of new housing, for a total of
4,405 new housing units across the City. Of these units, 891 are income-restricted units. While new housing projects
were scattered across the city, the largest completed projects by number of units include the apartments at 345
Harrison Avenue in the South End (602 units), the Pierce (350 units), and the Charlesview Redevelopment in
Brighton (340 units).
The Boston Housing Authority (“BHA”) is the largest public housing authority in New England and sixth
in the nation. The agency provides subsidized housing to low and moderate income individuals and families. The
Authority owns and operates 63 family and elderly and disabled developments that are home to more than 25,000
residents. Most of the 12,600 households in BHA housing have extremely low-income, averaging $14,000 per year.
BHA also administers Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8 or leased housing) to over 12,000 families that lease
apartments from private landlords. The BHA helps provide housing to approximately 33,000 people under these
programs. 17

BHA’s Five-Year Agency Plan sets forth new goals and strategies to develop property-by-property to
ensure the long-term sustainability of its public housing communities. Agency initiatives consider the severe and
persistent funding shortfalls in the federal public housing program, and identified several housing developments
with high potential for accessing capital and operating resources outside of the conventional public housing
program. These developments are Bunker Hill in Charlestown, Amory Street in Jamaica Plain, Lenox/Camden in
Roxbury, and West Newton in the South End. BHA’s goal is to preserve the deeply affordable units that exist at the
sites today while, where feasible, adding new moderate-income and market-rate housing units to create vibrant
mixed-income communities.
In early 2017, BHA began the first phase of redevelopment for the Whittier Street housing developing in
Lower Roxbury, built in 1953 and one of the BHA’s oldest properties. 18 A $30 million Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) grant will facilitate the preservation and expansion of 509 units of mixed-income rental
housing and 14,225 square feet of commercial space. In June 2018, Phase I of the Orient Heights redevelopment
project in East Boston was completed, a $51.2 million investment that constructed 120 units of new affordable rental
housing, 30 of which are a net increase to the existing BHA stock. In November, Phase II began, a $51.6 million
investment that will rebuild 88 units as part of the eventual 331-unit development. Phase II leverages $10 million in
proceeds from the sale of the Winthrop Square Garage as well as $1.83 million in IDP funds from the 99 Sumner
Street Development in East Boston. In December 2018, the BHA began construction on the O-Connor Way Senior
Housing Development. Caritas Communities and the South Boston Neighborhood Development Corporation will
co-develop 46 one-bedroom units of affordable housing for adults age 62 and older on formerly vacant BHA-owned
land. The development was funded in part by the Inclusionary Development Program contributions from 150
Seaport Boulevard and Pier 4 development projects.
The Linkage Program
The City implemented its development linkage program in 1983 in order to direct some of the benefits of
downtown investment to the building of affordable housing in its neighborhoods through the Neighborhood Housing
Trust (“NHT”). The linkage program also funds job training for City residents through the Neighborhood Jobs Trust
(“NJT”). Under the linkage program, which was amended in 1986, 2001, and again in 2013, real estate developers
seeking approval of large scale commercial or institutional developments are required to enter into agreements to
pay exactions in the amount of $10.81 per square-foot of non-residential construction over 100,000 square feet, of
which $1.78 per square-foot goes to the job training fund and $9.03 per square-foot goes for affordable housing
purposes. The fee was last adjusted as of June 14, 2018. Since its inception, the linkage program has collected
$177.8 million for the NHT and $37.8 million for the NJT.
The NHT has awarded approximately $186 million in grant funds from the start of the program through
December 2018. The NHT funding contributed to the construction or renovation of 14,824 housing units of which
12,604 units were income restricted. The NHT funding represents 5% of the combined development cost of all
assisted projects. NHT grant awards are allocated to fund low and moderate-income housing through the renovation
of old buildings and schools and the construction of new housing. Projects have included rental developments of
family-sized units, single room occupancy units, units set aside for homeless or formerly homeless households,
elderly housing units, and units exclusively for other special needs populations. In addition, the NHT grants support
the development of housing ownership opportunities in condominiums, housing cooperatives, and single-family
homes.
NJT supports innovative education and training activities leading to high wage employment, new or nontraditional employment opportunities, and community-based projects that respond to specific neighborhoods’
education and training needs. The NJT is committed to providing appropriate services to the residents of
neighborhoods where, or adjacent to where, a given development project is located, while also ensuring that
residents throughout the City have access to new jobs resulting from development. In Fiscal Year 2018, NJT
disbursed approximately $2.5 million to job training and education programs. Among the NJT-funded programs
were 16 job training programs chosen through an open request for proposals process. From Spring 2017 through Fall
2018, these grantees trained more than 200 adults for such industry sectors as banking/finance, building
maintenance, hospitality, healthcare, human services, and retail. Of the residents served by these grantee programs,
most faced at least one of the following barriers to employment: CORI record, Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families, housing vouchers, or homelessness/near-homelessness. Placed graduates made an average of $15.41 per
hour, with 75% earning benefits as well. This represented an average income increase of 39%.

In addition, NJT funded special projects through SkillWorks, English for New Bostonians, Boston Housing
Authority’s Charlestown Adult Education. These programs provided critical job training, English language
instruction, and educational opportunities for Boston residents. Neighborhood Jobs Trust funds also supported key
mayoral initiatives, including the Tuition-Free Community College (TFCC) Plan. TFCC provides up to three years
of tuition and mandatory fees for income-eligible Boston students who are attending community college. To date,
295 students have enrolled in TFCC. In FY 2018, NJT funds also supported the development of City Academy, an
innovative training pipeline for residents to access skills training for jobs with City agencies. Two cohorts of
trainees completed certification in a Commercial Driver's License/Hoisting track and an Emergency Medical
Technician track.

PROPOSED FORM OF LEGAL OPINION

APPENDIX B

(Date of Delivery)
Emme Handy, Chief Financial Officer
and Collector-Treasurer
City of Boston
Boston, Massachusetts
$145,130,000
City of Boston, Massachusetts
General Obligation Bonds
2019 Series A

We have acted as bond counsel to the City of Boston, Massachusetts (the “City”) in connection
with the issuance by the City of the above-referenced bonds (the “Bonds”). In such capacity, we
have examined the law and such certified proceedings and other papers as we have deemed
necessary to render this opinion.
As to questions of fact material to our opinion we have relied upon representations and
covenants of the City contained in the certified proceedings and other certifications of public
officials furnished to us, without undertaking to verify the same by independent investigation.
Based on our examination, we are of the opinion, under existing law, as follows:
1.
The Bonds are valid and binding general obligations of the City and, except to the
extent they are paid from other sources, the principal of and interest on the Bonds are payable
from taxes which may be levied upon all taxable property in the City.
2.
Interest on the Bonds is excluded from the gross income of the owners of the
Bonds for federal income tax purposes. In addition, interest on the Bonds is not a specific
preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. In rendering the
opinions set forth in this paragraph, we have assumed compliance by the City with all
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended that must be satisfied
subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that interest thereon be, and continue to be,
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The City has covenanted to
comply with all such requirements. Failure by the City to comply with certain of such
requirements may cause interest on the Bonds to become included in gross income for federal
income tax purposes retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds. We express no opinion
regarding any other federal tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds.
B-1

3.
Interest on the Bonds is exempt from Massachusetts personal income taxes and
the Bonds are exempt from Massachusetts personal property taxes. We express no opinion
regarding any other Massachusetts tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds or any tax

Certificate to violate the Rule. The first Annual Report filed after enactment of any amendment
to or waiver of this Disclosure Certificate shall explain, in narrative form, the reasons for the
amendment or waiver and the impact of the change in the type of information being provided in

also be quantitative. A notice of the change in the accounting principles shall be sent to the MSRB.
SECTION 9. Default. In the event of a failure of the Issuer to comply with any provision
of this Disclosure Certificate any Owner of the Bonds may seek a court order for specific
performance by the Issuer of its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate. A default under this
Disclosure Certificate shall not constitute a default with respect to the Bonds, and the sole remedy
under this Disclosure Certificate in the event of any failure of the Issuer to comply with this
Disclosure Certificate shall be an action for specific performance of the Issuer’s obligations
hereunder and not for money damages in any amount.

The Bonds will bear interest, calculated on the basis of 30-day months and a 360-day year, at
such rate or rates per annum as are specified by the successful bidder therefore in accordance herewith.
The Bonds will be issued by means of a book-entry system with no physical distribution of Bonds made
to the public. One Bond certificate for each maturity will be issued to The Depository Trust Company,
New York, New York (“DTC”), and immobilized in its custody. A book-entry system will be employed,
evidencing ownership of the Bonds in principal amounts of $5,000 or integral multiples thereof, with
transfers of ownership effected on the records of DTC and its participants pursuant to rules and
procedures established by DTC and its participants. The successful bidder, as a condition to delivery of
the Bonds, shall be required to deposit the Bond certificates with DTC, registered in the name of Cede &
Co. Interest on the Bonds will be payable semiannually on March 1 and September 1, beginning
September 1, 2019 until maturity or redemption prior to maturity. Principal of the Bonds will be paid
annually on March 1, as set forth in the foregoing maturity schedule, to DTC or its nominee as registered
owner of the Bonds. Transfer of principal and interest payments to participants of DTC will be the
responsibility of DTC; transfer of principal and interest payments to beneficial owners by participants of
DTC will be the responsibility of such participants and other nominees of beneficial owners. The record
date for principal and interest payments will be the fifteenth day of the month next preceding the date on
which interest is to be paid, however, if such date is not a business day, the record date will be the
following business day. The City will not be responsible or liable for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records maintained by DTC, its participants or persons acting through such participants.

*

Preliminary, subject to change as described herein.

D-3

In the event that (a) DTC determines not to continue to act as securities depository for the Bonds
or (b) the Chief Financial Officer and Collector-Treasurer determines that continuation of the book-entry
system of evidence and transfer of ownership of the Bonds would adversely affect the interests of the
beneficial owners of the Bonds, the City will discontinue the book-entry system with DTC. If the City
fails to identify another qualified securities depository to replace DTC, the City will authenticate and
deliver replacement Bonds in the form of fully registered certificates.
It is anticipated that CUSIP identification numbers will be printed on the Bonds, but neither the
failure to print such numbers on any Bond nor any error with respect thereto shall constitute cause for
failure or refusal by the purchaser thereof to accept delivery of and pay for the Bonds in accordance with
the terms of its bid. No CUSIP identification numbers shall be deemed to be part of any Bond or a part of
the contract evidenced thereby and no liability shall hereafter attach to the City or any of its officers or
agents because of or on account of such numbers. The City shall pay all expenses in connection with the
initial assignment and printing of CUSIP numbers. The original purchaser of the Bonds will be
responsible for applying for and obtaining CUSIP identification numbers for the Bonds.
Redemption—The Bonds maturing on or before March 1, 2029 will not be subject to redemption
prior to maturity. The Bonds maturing after March 1, 2029 will be subject to redemption prior to
maturity at the option of the City, on or after March 1, 2029 as a whole or in part at any time, in such
order of maturity as the City may determine and by lot within each maturity as selected by DTC and its
participants, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed, plus
accrued interest to the redemption date.
Term bonds, if any, shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption on March 1 in the year
or years immediately prior to the stated maturity of such term bonds as specified by the successful bidder
(the particular Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed to be selected by lot), in the amount in each such
year indicated in the foregoing maturity schedules at the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to
the redemption date, without premium.
Notice of redemption of the Bonds will be given as set forth in the Official Statement.
Price, Debt Service and Interest Rates—Bids for the Bonds must be for the entire series (all or
none) at a price not less than 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds. The dollar amount bid
by the successful bidder will be adjusted proportionately to reflect any reduction or increase in the final
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds (see Adjustment of Principal Amount, below). Bids must state an
interest rate of 5.00% for each maturity of the Bonds. Each Bond shall bear interest from its date to its
stated maturity date at the single interest rate specified in the bid. Bids may specify that all the Bonds are
to be issued as serial bonds or that the principal amounts of the Bonds in any two or more consecutive
years may be combined into no more than two term bonds. The Bonds will be issued as serial bonds or a
combination of serial bonds and term bond(s) in accordance with the bid submitted by the successful
bidder. All such term bonds are subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption prior to maturity at par as
described above, in each of the years and in the principal amounts specified in the foregoing maturity
schedules. Each mandatory sinking fund redemption shall be allocated to the payment of the term bond
maturing in the nearest subsequent year.
Adjustment of Principal Amount—After selecting the winning bid, the City reserves the right to
determine the aggregate principal amount and annual principal amounts of the Bonds. The City will not
reduce or increase the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds by more than 10%, although individual
maturities could vary by more than 10%.
D-4

The City anticipates that the final aggregate principal amount and final maturity schedule will be
communicated to the successful bidder by 4:00 P.M. (Eastern Time) on the day of award, provided the
City has received the reoffering prices and yields for the Bonds from the successful bidder, as described
below under “Certificate of Winning Bidder.” The dollar amount bid by the successful bidder will be
adjusted to reflect any adjustment in the principal amount of the Bonds to be issued. The adjusted bid
price will reflect changes in the dollar amount of the underwriter’s discount and original issue
discount/premium, if any, but will not change the per-bond underwriter’s discount as calculated from the
bid and reoffering prices required to be delivered to the City as stated herein. The successful bidder may
not withdraw their bid or change the interest rates bid or initial reoffering prices as a result of any changes
made to the principal amounts within these limits.
Basis of Award—Unless all bids are rejected, all of the Bonds will be awarded to the bidder
offering to purchase all of the Bonds o at the lowest net effective interest rate to the City. Such interest
rate shall be determined on a true interest cost (TIC) basis. True interest cost (expressed as an
annual interest rate) shall be determined for each bid by doubling the semiannual interest rate,
compounded semiannually, necessary to discount the debt service payments from the payment
dates to the date of delivery and to the price bid. In the event there is more than one bid specifying the
lowest such rate, the Bonds will be awarded to the bidder whose bid is selected by the Chief Financial
Officer and Collector-Treasurer by lot from among all such bids. It is requested that each bid be
accompanied by a statement of such interest cost, computed at the interest rate or rates stated in the bid in
accordance with the above method of computation (computed to six decimal places), but such statement
will not be considered as part of the bid.
On the date of award, both the City and the successful bidder for the Bonds shall execute a Bid
Confirmation and Award Certificate substantially in the form attached hereto as Attachment B.
Women & Minority Participation—It is the policy of the City that women’s business enterprises and
minority business enterprises shall be given appropriate consideration. The City requests and strongly
urges bidders to make a good faith effort to include such firms in their management or selling groups or
syndicates.
Right to Cancel or Postpone the Submission of Bids; Right to Reject Bids—The City reserves the
right to cancel or postpone the submission of bids, or to reject any and all bids. If the City elects to
exercise its right to cancel the submission of bids, or its right to reject all submitted bids, this Official
Notice of Sale shall become void. The City may, but shall not be required to, solicit bids thereafter,
subject to the terms of a revised official notice of sale to be published subsequent to such cancellation or
rejection. If the City elects to exercise its right to postpone the submission of bids, it shall provide
subsequent notice of the date on which bids will be received after notification on TM3 not later than 8:30
A.M., Eastern Time, on the day designated for receipt of bids.
Any bid not complying with the terms of this Official Notice of Sale or specifying any conditions
additional to those herein may be rejected. The City reserves the right to waive any irregularity or
informality in compliance with the terms of this Official Notice of Sale to the extent permitted by law.
Any award by the Chief Financial Officer and Collector-Treasurer to a successful bidder is subject to the
approval of the Mayor.
Right to Modify or Amend Official Notice of Sale—The City reserves the right to modify or amend
this Official Notice of Sale, including changing the scheduled maturities or increasing or reducing the
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds and the principal amount of any maturity offered for sale, prior
to the bid date. If any modifications occur, supplemental information with respect to the Bonds will be
communicated via TM3 not later than 5:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on the day preceding the day designated
D-5

for the receipt of bids, and bidders shall bid upon the Bonds based upon the terms thereof set forth in this
Official Notice of Sale as so modified.
Good Faith Deposit—The City will require the submission of a Good Faith Deposit ("Deposit")
by the successful bidder, as determined by the City in accordance with this Notice of Sale, in the amount
of $1,500,000. The Deposit will secure the City from any loss resulting from the failure of the successful
bidder to comply with the terms of its bid. The successful bidder shall transfer the Deposit by wire
transfer directly to the City upon notification, but in any case, no later than 3:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on
the date of award of the Bonds. The Deposit will be held by the City and applied toward a portion of the
total purchase price of the Bonds. No interest on the Deposit will accrue to the successful bidder. Wire
instructions will be provided to the successful bidder upon notification of the preliminary award.
Preliminary Official Statement—For purposes of Rule 15c2-12 promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Rule 15c2-12”),
as of the date of the Preliminary Official Statement dated February 26, 2019 (the “Preliminary Official
Statement”), the City deemed the Preliminary Official Statement “final” (as that term is used in paragraph
(b)(1) of said Rule 15c2-12) except for the omission of certain information permitted to be omitted by
such rule.
Official Statement—The Initial Reoffering Price or Yield for each maturity of the Bonds, as
provided by the successful bidder, will be printed on the inside cover page of the Official Statement
relating to the Bonds (including all appendices thereto, the “Official Statement”) to be dated the date of
award of the Bonds to the successful bidder (the “Sale Date”). The successful bidder will be required to
acknowledge receipt of such Official Statement and will be responsible to the City and its officials in all
respects for the accuracy and completeness of such reoffering information. The City assumes no
responsibility or obligation for distribution or delivery of any copies of the Official Statement to anyone
other than the successful bidder.
The City confirms that, upon delivery thereof in accordance herewith, the Official Statement will be
a final Official Statement within the meaning of Rule 15c2-12, and further agrees to provide the
successful bidder not later than seven business days after the Sale Date, as many copies of the Official
Statement as the successful bidder may reasonably request in order for the successful bidder to comply
with the requirements of Rule 15c2-12 and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
(“MSRB”). Electronic copies of the Official Statement will be furnished without cost to the successful
bidder of the Bonds. Further copies of the Official Statement, if desired, will be made available to the
successful bidder at its expense. The successful bidder shall notify the City as soon as practicable of the
date which is the “end of the underwriting period” (as defined in Rule 15c2-12).
From the date of the Official Statement until the earlier of (i) ninety (90) days from the end of the
underwriting period, as such underwriting period is defined in Rule 15c2-12, or (ii) the time when the
Official Statement is available to any person from the MSRB, but in no case less than twenty-five (25)
days following the end of such underwriting period, if any event affecting the City or the Bonds shall
occur of which the City has actual knowledge and which would cause the Official Statement, in the
reasonable opinion of the City or the successful bidder, to contain an untrue or incorrect statement of
material fact or to omit to state a material fact that would cause the Official Statement to be misleading in
the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, the City will notify the
successful bidder and, at the written request of either successful bidder, will forthwith prepare and furnish
to each successful bidder such number of copies of an amendment of or supplement to the Official
Statement (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the City and the successful bidder) as the
successful bidder may reasonably request in order for the successful bidder to comply with Rule 15c2-12
and the rules of the MSRB, which will amend or supplement the Official Statement so that it will not
D-6

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Official Statement is
delivered to a purchaser, not misleading.
If the sale of the Bonds is awarded to a syndicate, the City will designate the senior managing
underwriter of the syndicate as its agent for purposes of distributing copies of the Official Statement to
each participating underwriter. Any underwriter executing and delivering a bid form with respect to the
Bonds agrees thereby that if its bid is accepted it shall accept such designation and shall enter into a
contractual relationship with all participating underwriters for the purpose of assuring the receipt and
distribution by each such participating underwriter of the Official Statement.
Continuing Disclosure—In order to assist bidders in complying with Rule 15c2-12(b)(5)
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the City will undertake to provide annual
reports and notices of certain significant events. A description of this undertaking is set forth in the
Preliminary Official Statement. The City will deliver a certificate regarding its undertaking with respect
to continuing disclosure substantially in the form presented in Appendix C to the Preliminary Official
Statement referenced herein (the “Certificate”).
In order to assist the City in carrying out its obligations under the Certificate and its other disclosure
undertakings the City has entered into an agreement with Digital Assurance Certification LLC (“DAC”)
pursuant to which DAC serves as dissemination agent for the City with respect to the continuing
disclosure filings required to satisfy such obligations.

transmission, manual delivery or overnight delivery received by the City within 24 hours after receipt of
bids for the Bonds, furnish the following information to the City to complete the Official Statement in
final form, as described below:

reasonably expected initial offering prices to the public or the sale prices of the Bonds together with the
supporting pricing wires or equivalent communications, with such modifications as may be appropriate or
necessary in the reasonable judgment of the successful bidder, the City and Bond Counsel. All actions to
be taken by the City under this Notice of Sale to establish the issue price of the Bonds may be taken on
behalf of the City by PFM Financial Advisors LLC (“Municipal Advisor”) and any notice or report to be
provided to the City may be provided to the Municipal Advisor.
Competitive Sale Requirements. The City expects that the competitive sale requirements
(“competitive sale requirements”) set forth in Treasury Regulation § 1.148-1(f)(3)(i) (defining
“competitive sale” for purposes of establishing the issue price of the Bonds) will apply to the sale of the
Bonds because:
(1)
the City has disseminated this Notice of Sale to potential underwriters in
a manner that is reasonably designed to reach potential underwriters;
(2)

all bidders will have an equal opportunity to bid;

(3)
the City may receive bids from at least three underwriters of municipal
bonds who have established industry reputations for underwriting new issuances of
municipal bonds; and
(4)
the City anticipates awarding the sale of the Bonds to the bidder who
submitted a firm offer to purchase the Bonds at the highest price (or lowest interest cost),
as set forth in this Notice of Sale.
Any bid submitted pursuant to this Notice of Sale shall be considered a firm offer for the
purchase of the Bonds, as specified in the bid. By submitting a bid, each bidder shall be deemed to
confirm that it has an established industry reputation for underwriting new issuances of municipal
bonds and that it will be an “underwriter” (as defined below) that intends to reoffer the Bonds to
the public.
In the event that the competitive sale requirements are not satisfied, the City shall so advise the
successful bidder. In this event, the successful bidder may use either Option A or Option B, set forth
below.
Failure to Meet the Competitive Sale Requirements – Option A – The 10% Test to Apply. If the
competitive sale requirements are not satisfied, the successful bidder may, at its option, use the first price
at which 10% of a maturity of the Bonds (the “10% test”) is sold to the public as the issue price of that
maturity, applied on a maturity-by-maturity basis, of the Bonds. The successful bidder shall advise the
Municipal Advisor if any maturity of the Bonds satisfies the 10% test as of the date and time of the award
of the Bonds.
If the competitive sale requirements are not satisfied, then until the 10% test has been satisfied as
to each maturity of the Bonds or all of the Bonds are sold to the public, the successful bidder agrees to
promptly report to the Municipal Advisor the prices at which the unsold Bonds of each maturity have
been sold to the public, which reporting obligation shall continue, whether or not the Closing Date has
occurred, until the 10% test has been satisfied for each maturity of the Bonds or until all the Bonds of a
maturity have been sold. The successful bidder shall be obligated to report each sale of Bonds to the
D-8

Municipal Advisor until notified in writing by the City or the Municipal Advisor that it no longer needs to
do so. If the successful bidder uses Option A, the successful bidder shall provide to the City on or before
the Closing Date the certificate attached to this Notice of Sale as Exhibit 1 – Option A.
By submitting a bid and if the competitive sale requirements are not met, each bidder confirms
that: (i) any agreement among underwriters, any selling group agreement and each retail distribution
agreement (to which the bidder is a party) relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together
with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each underwriter, each dealer
who is a member of the selling group, and each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution
agreement, as applicable, to report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each
maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the successful bidder that either the 10% test has been satisfied
as to the Bonds of that maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public, if and for so
long as directed by the successful bidder and as set forth in the related pricing wires and (ii) any
agreement among underwriters relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the
related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each underwriter that is a party to a
retail distribution agreement to be employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public
to require each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution agreement to report the prices at
which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the
successful bidder or such underwriter that either the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that
maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public if and for so long as directed by the
successful bidder or such underwriter and as set forth in the related pricing wires.
Sales of any Bonds to any person that is a related party to an underwriter shall not constitute sales
to the public for purposes of this Notice of Sale. Further, for purposes of this Notice of Sale:
(1)

“public” means any person other than an underwriter or a related party,

(2)
“underwriter” means (A) any person, including the successful bidder, that agrees
pursuant to a written contract with the City (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting
syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public and (B) any person that agrees
pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a person described in clause (A) to participate in
the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a retail
distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public), and
(3)
a purchaser of any of the Bonds is a “related party” to an underwriter if the underwriter
and the purchaser are subject, directly or indirectly, to (i) at least 50% common ownership of the voting
power or the total value of their stock, if both entities are corporations (including direct ownership by one
corporation of another), (ii) more than 50% common ownership of their capital interests or profits
interests, if both entities are partnerships (including direct ownership by one partnership of another), or
(iii) more than 50% common ownership of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation or the
capital interests or profit interests of the partnership, as applicable, if one entity is a corporation and the
other entity is a partnership (including direct ownership of the applicable stock or interests by one entity
of the other).
Failure to Meet the Competitive Sale Requirements – Option B – The Successful Bidder Agrees to
Hold the Price of Maturities of Bonds for Which the 10% Test in Option A Is Not Met as of the Sale
Date. The successful bidder may, at its option, notify the Municipal Advisor in writing, which may be by
email (the “Hold the Price Notice”), not later than 4:00 p.m. on the Sale Date, that it has not sold 10% of
the maturities of the Bonds listed in the Hold the Price Notice (the “Hold-the-Offering-Price Maturities”)
and that the successful bidder will not offer the Hold-the-Offering-Price Maturities to any person at a
price that is higher than the initial offering price to the public during the period starting on the Sale Date
and ending on the earlier of (i) the close of the fifth business day after the Sale Date or (ii) the date on
D-9

which the successful bidder has sold at least 10% of the applicable Hold-the-Offering-Price Maturity to
the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public. If the successful bidder
uses Option B and delivers a Hold the Price Notice to the Municipal Advisor, the successful bidder shall
provide to the City on or before the Closing Date the certificate attached to this Notice of Sale as Exhibit
1 – Option B.
Settlement—It is expected that settlement of the Bonds will occur on the date of delivery or, in any
event, on a business day not later than 30 days after the City awards the Bonds to the successful bidder
therefor. Delivery of the Bonds shall be made to DTC against payment therefor in federal funds; and
delivery of the other documents referred to below will be made at the office of Locke Lord LLP, 111
Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, 02199-7613. The City will notify the purchaser of the Bonds
of the date on which the settlement will take place not later than 72 hours after the Bid Notification Date.
If the Bonds are not delivered within 30 days after the award of the Bonds, the successful bidder for the
Bonds may withdraw its bid and the good faith deposit accompanying its bid shall be returned.
Documents to be Delivered at Closing—It shall be a condition to the obligation of a successful
bidder for the Bonds to purchase such Bonds that, contemporaneously with or before accepting evidence
of the ownership of the Bonds and paying therefor, the successful bidder shall be furnished with (a) the
approving opinion of Locke Lord LLP, Bond Counsel to the City, substantially in the form presented in
Appendix B to the Preliminary Official Statement; (b) a certificate of the Corporation Counsel, dated as
of the date of delivery of the Bonds, to the effect that there is no litigation pending, or to his knowledge,
threatened (i) seeking to restrain or enjoin the issuance or delivery of the Bonds; (ii) in any way
contesting or affecting any authority for or the validity of the Bonds; (iii) contesting the power of the City
to levy and collect taxes to pay the Bonds; (iv) contesting the corporate existence or boundaries of the
City; or (v) contesting the title of officials of the City who have acted with respect to the proceedings for
the issuance and sale of the Bonds to their respective offices; (c) a signed copy of the Official Statement
relating to the Bonds, which Official Statement shall be substantially in the form of the Preliminary
Official Statement with such changes as the City deems necessary or appropriate to reflect the final terms
of the Bonds; (d) a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer and Collector-Treasurer to the effect that to
the best of her knowledge and belief the Preliminary Official Statement (excluding the information under
the heading “The Bonds–Book-Entry-Transfer-System”), as of the Sale Date and the Official Statement
(excluding the initial public offering prices (or yields) of the Bonds on the inside cover page thereto, the
information under the heading “The Bonds – Book-Entry Transfer System” and the information regarding
reoffering compensation due to underwriters under the heading “Competitive Sale of Bonds” and, if bond
insurance is obtained by a successful bidder, the information relating to the insurance policy and the
provider thereof), both as of the Sale Date and the date of settlement of the Bonds, did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(e) a Continuing Disclosure Certificate in the form presented in Appendix C to the Preliminary Official
Statement; and (f) a supplemental opinion of Locke Lord LLP, Bond Counsel to the City, addressed to the
successful bidder for the Bonds, to the effect that, they have rendered legal advice and assistance to the
City in the course of and have participated in the preparation of the Official Statement and, based upon
such participation, they are of the opinion that the information contained in the Official Statement under
the captions “The Bonds” (except for the information therein under the heading “Book-Entry Transfer
System”), “Security for the Bonds,” “Tax Exemption” and “Legal Matters” (except for any financial or
statistical data included therein as to which no view will be expressed) does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; in addition, based upon such
participation and, except as to the information contained therein under the captions set forth above,
although they are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness
or fairness of the statements contained in the Official Statement, and have not undertaken to determine the
D-10

accuracy or completeness of the statements contained therein, during the course of their participation and
the preparation of the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement, nothing has come to
their attention which would lead them to believe that the Preliminary Official Statement, as of the Sale
Date, and the Official Statement, as of the Sale Date and the date of settlement of the Bonds (except in
each case for the financial statements and other financial and statistical data included therein, the
information contained under the heading “The Bonds – Book-Entry Transfer System”, the information
contained in Exhibits I, II and III to Appendix A thereto, the stabilization clause, the initial public
offering prices (or yields) of the Bonds contained in the Official Statement on page (i) thereto, and, if,
bond insurance is obtained by either successful bidder with respect to the Bonds, the information in the
Official Statement relating to the insurance policy and the provider thereof, as to which no view will be
expressed) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material facts
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.
